In his _Journal to Stella_, his social\\nverses, and his letters to his friends, we have a vivid picture of those\\nrelations with women and that protracted suffering which invest with such\\ntragic interest the history of Swift. Pope, by the publication of his own\\ncorrespondence, has enabled us, in a way that he never intended, to\\nunderstand the strange moral twist which distorted a nature by no means\\ndevoid of noble instincts. Johnson was fortunate in the companionship of\\nperhaps the best biographer who ever lived. But of the real life and\\ncharacter of Addison scarcely any contemporary record remains. The formal\\nnarrative prefixed to his works by Tickell is, by that writer\\'s own\\nadmission, little more than a bibliography. Steele, who might have told us\\nmore than any man about his boyhood and his manner of life in London, had\\nbecome estranged from his old friend before his death. No writer has\\ntaken the trouble to preserve any account of the wit and wisdom that\\nenlivened the \"little senate\" at Button\\'s. His own letters are, as a rule,\\ncompositions as finished as his papers in the _Spectator_. Those features\\nin his character which excite the greatest interest have been delineated\\nby the hand of an enemy--an enemy who possessed an unrivalled power of\\nsatirical portrait-painting, and was restrained by no regard for truth\\nfrom creating in the public mind such impressions about others as might\\nserve to heighten the favourable opinion of himself.\\n\\nThis absence of dramatic incident in Addison\\'s life would lead us\\nnaturally to conclude that he was deficient in the energy and passion\\nwhich cause a powerful nature to leave a mark upon its age. Yet such a\\njudgment would certainly be erroneous. Shy and reserved as he was, the\\nunanimous verdict of his most illustrious contemporaries is decisive as to\\nthe respect and admiration which he excited among them. The man who could\\nexert so potent an influence over the mercurial Steele, who could\\nfascinate the haughty and cynical intellect of Swift, whose conversation,\\nby the admission of his satirist Pope, had in it something more charming\\nthan that of any other man; of whom it was said that he might have been\\nchosen king if he wished it; such a man, though to the coarse perception\\nof Mandeville he might have seemed no more than \"a parson in a tye-wig,\"\\ncan hardly have been deficient in force of character.\\n\\nNor would it have been possible for a writer distinguished by mere\\nelegance and refinement to leave a lasting impress on the literature and\\nsociety of his country. In one generation after another, men representing\\nopposing elements of rank, class, interest, and taste, have agreed in\\nacknowledging Addison\\'s extraordinary merits. \"Whoever wishes,\" says\\nJohnson--at the end of a biography strongly coloured with the\\nprepossessions of a semi-Jacobite Tory--\"whoever wishes to attain an\\nEnglish style, familiar but not coarse, and elegant but not ostentatious,\\nmust give his days and nights to the volumes of Addison.\" \"Such a mark of\\nnational respect,\" says Macaulay, the best representative of middle-class\\nopinion in the present century, speaking of the statue erected to Addison\\nin Westminster Abbey, \"was due to the unsullied statesman, to the\\naccomplished scholar, to the master of pure English eloquence, to the\\nconsummate painter of life and manners. It was due, above all, to the\\ngreat satirist who alone knew how to use ridicule without abusing it; who,\\nwithout inflicting a wound, effected a great social reform, and who\\nreconciled wit and virtue after a long and disastrous separation, during\\nwhich wit had been led astray by profligacy, and virtue by fanaticism.\"\\n\\nThis verdict of a great critic is accepted by an age to which the grounds\\nof it are, perhaps, not very apparent. The author of any ideal creation--a\\npoem, a drama, or a novel--has an imprescriptible property in the fame of\\nhis work. But to harmonise conflicting social elements, to bring order out\\nof chaos in the sphere of criticism, to form right ways of thinking about\\nquestions of morals, taste, and breeding, are operations of which the\\ncredit, though it is certainly to be ascribed to particular individuals,\\nis generally absorbed by society itself. Macaulay\\'s eulogy is as just as\\nit is eloquent, but the pages of the _Spectator_ alone will hardly show\\nthe reader why Addison should be so highly praised for having reconciled\\nwit with virtue. Nor, looking at him as a critic, will it appear a great\\nachievement to have pointed out to English society the beauties of\\n_Paradise Lost_, unless it be remembered that the taste of the preceding\\ngeneration still influenced Addison\\'s contemporaries, and that in that\\ngeneration Cowley was accounted a greater poet than Milton.\\n\\nTo estimate Addison at his real value we must regard him as the chief\\narchitect of Public Opinion in the eighteenth century. But here again we\\nare met by an initial difficulty, because it has become almost a\\ncommonplace of contemporary criticism to represent the eighteenth century\\nas a period of sheer destruction. It is tacitly assumed by a school of\\ndistinguished philosophical writers that we have arrived at a stage in the\\nworld\\'s history in which it is possible to take a positive and scientific\\nview of human affairs. As it is of course necessary that from such a\\nsystem all belief in the supernatural shall be jealously excluded, it has\\nnot seemed impossible to write the history of Thought itself in the\\neighteenth century. And in tracing the course of this supposed continuous\\nstream it is natural that all the great English writers of the period\\nshould be described as in one way or another helping to pull down, or\\nvainly to strengthen, the theological barriers erected by centuries of\\nbigotry against the irresistible tide of enlightened progress.\\n\\nIt would be of course entirely out of place to discuss here the merits of\\nthis new school of history. Those who consider that, whatever glimpses we\\nmay obtain of the law and order of the universe, man is, as he always has\\nbeen and always will be, a mystery to himself, will hardly allow that the\\noperations of the human spirit can be traced in the dissecting-room. But\\nit is, in any case, obvious that to treat the great _imaginative_ writers\\nof any age as if they were only mechanical agents in an evolution of\\nthought is to do them grave injustice. Such writers are, above all things,\\ncreative. Their first aim is to \"show the very age and body of the time\\nhis form and pressure.\" No work of the eighteenth century, composed in a\\nconsciously destructive spirit, has taken its place among the acknowledged\\nclassics of the language. Even the _Tale of a Tub_ is to be regarded as a\\nsatire upon the aberrations of theologians from right reason, not upon the\\nprinciples of Christianity itself. The _Essay on Man_ has, no doubt,\\nlogically a tendency towards Deism, but nobody ever read the poem for the\\nsake of its philosophy; and it is well known that Pope was much alarmed\\nwhen it was pointed out to him that his conclusions might be represented\\nas incompatible with the doctrines of revealed religion.\\n\\nThe truth indeed seems to be the exact converse of what is alleged by the\\nscientific historians. So far from the eighteenth century in England being\\nan age of destructive analysis, its energies were chiefly devoted to\\npolitical, social, and literary reconstruction. Whatever revolution in\\nfaith and manners the English nation had undergone had been the work of\\nthe two preceding centuries, and though the historic foundations of\\nsociety remained untouched, the whole form of the superstructure had been\\nprofoundly modified.\\n\\n    \"So tenacious are we,\" said Burke, towards the close of the last\\n    century, \"of our old ecclesiastical modes and fashions of institution\\n    that very little change has been made in them since the fourteenth or\\n    fifteenth centuries, adhering in this particular as in all else to our\\n    old settled maxim never entirely nor at once to depart from antiquity.\\n    We found these institutions on the whole favourable to morality and\\n    discipline, and we thought they were susceptible of amendment without\\n    altering the ground. We thought they were capable of receiving and\\n    meliorating, and, above all, of preserving the accessories of science\\n    and literature as the order of Providence should successively produce\\n    them. And after all, with this Gothic and monkish education (for such\\n    it is the groundwork), we may put in our claim to as ample and early\\n    a share in all the improvements in science, in arts, and in literature\\n    which have illuminated the modern world as any other nation in Europe.\\n    We think one main cause of this improvement was our not despising the\\n    patrimony of knowledge which was left us by our forefathers.\"\\n\\nAll this is, in substance, true of our political as well as our\\necclesiastical institutions. And yet, when Burke wrote, the great feudal\\nand mediæval structure of England had been so transformed by the Wars of\\nthe Roses, the Reformation, the Rebellion, and the Revolution, that its\\nancient outlines were barely visible. In so far, therefore, as his words\\nseem to imply that the social evolution he describes was produced by an\\nimperceptible and almost mechanical process of national instinct, the\\nimpression they tend to create is entirely erroneous.\\n\\nIf we have been hitherto saved from such corruption as undermined the\\nrepublics of Italy, from the religious wars that so long enfeebled and\\ndivided Germany, and from the Revolution that has severed modern France\\nfrom her ancient history, thanks for this are due partly, no doubt, to\\nfavouring conditions of nature and society, but quite as much to the\\ngenius of great individuals who prepared the mind of the nation for the\\ngradual assimilation of new ideas. Thus Langland and Wycliffe and their\\nnumerous followers, long before the Reformation, had so familiarised the\\nminds of the people with their ideas of the Christian religion that the\\nSovereign was able to assume the Headship of the Church without the shock\\nof a social convulsion. Fresh feelings and instincts grew up in the hearts\\nof whole classes of the nation without at first producing any change in\\noutward habits of life, and even without arousing a sense of their logical\\nincongruity. These mixed ideas were constantly brought before the\\nimagination in the works of the poets. Shakespeare abounds with passages\\nin which, side by side with the old feudal, monarchical, catholic, and\\npatriotic instincts of Englishmen, we find the sentiments of the Italian\\nRenaissance. Spenser conveys Puritan doctrines sometimes by the mouth of\\nshepherds, whose originals he had found in Theocritus and Virgil;\\nsometimes under allegorical forms derived from books of chivalry and the\\nceremonial of the Catholic Church. Milton, the most rigidly Calvinistic of\\nall the English poets in his opinions, is also the most severely classical\\nin his style.\\n\\nIt was the task of Addison to carry on the reconciling traditions of our\\nliterature. It is his praise to have accomplished his task under\\nconditions far more difficult than any that his predecessors had\\nexperienced. What they had done was to give instinctive and characteristic\\nexpression to the floating ideas of the society about them; what Addison\\nand his contemporaries did was to found a public opinion by a conscious\\neffort of reason and persuasion. Before the Civil Wars there had been at\\nleast no visible breach in the principle of Authority in Church and State.\\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century constituted authority had been\\nrecently overthrown; one king had been beheaded, another had been\\nexpelled; the Episcopalian form of Church Government had been violently\\ndisplaced in favour of the Presbyterian, and had been with almost equal\\nviolence restored. Whole classes of the population had been drawn into\\nopposing camps during the Civil War, and still stood confronting each\\nother with all the harsh antagonism of sentiment inherited from that\\nconflict. Such a bare summary alone is sufficient to indicate the nature\\nof the difficulties Addison had to encounter in his efforts to harmonise\\npublic opinion; but a more detailed examination of the state of society\\nafter the Restoration is required to place in its full light the\\nextraordinary merits of the success that he achieved.\\n\\nThere was, to begin with, a vehement opposition between town and country.\\nIn the country the old ideas of Feudalism, modified by circumstances, but\\nvigorous and deep-rooted, still prevailed. True, the military system of\\nland-tenure had disappeared with the Restoration, but it was not so with\\nthe relations of life, and the habits of thought and feeling which the\\nsystem had created. The features of surviving Feudalism have been\\ninimitably preserved for us in the character of Sir Roger de Coverley.\\nLiving in the patriarchal fashion, in the midst of tenants and retainers,\\nwho looked up to him as their chief, and for whose welfare and protection\\nhe considered himself responsible, the country gentleman valued above all\\nthings the principle of Loyalty. To the moneyed classes in the towns he\\nwas instinctively opposed; he regarded their interests, both social and\\ncommercial, as contrary to his own; he looked with dislike and suspicion\\non the economical principles of government and conduct on which these\\nclasses naturally rely. Even the younger sons of county families had in\\nAddison\\'s day abandoned the custom, common enough in the feudal times, of\\nseeking their fortune in trade. Many a Will Wimble now spent his whole\\nlife in the country, training dogs for his neighbours, fishing their\\nstreams, making whips for their young heirs, and even garters for their\\nwives and daughters.[1]\\n\\nThe country gentlemen were confirmed in these ideas by the difficulties of\\ncommunication. During his visit to Sir Roger de Coverley the _Spectator_\\nobserved the extreme slowness with which fashions penetrated into the\\ncountry; and he noticed, too, that party spirit was much more violent\\nthere than in the towns. The learning of the clergy, many of whom resided\\nwith the country squires as chaplains, was of course enlisted on the Tory\\nside, and supplied it with arguments which the body of the party might\\nperhaps have found it difficult to discover, or at least to express, for\\nthemselves. For Tory tastes undoubtedly lay generally rather in the\\ndirection of sport than of books. Sir Roger seems to be as much above the\\naverage level of his class as Squire Western is certainly below it:\\nperhaps the Tory fox-hunter of the _Freeholder_, though somewhat\\nsatirically painted, is a fair representative of the society which had its\\nheadquarters at the October Club, and whose favourite poet was Tom\\nD\\'Urfey.\\n\\nThe commercial and professional classes, from whom the Whigs derived their\\nchief support, of course predominated in the towns, and their larger\\nopportunities of association gave them an influence in affairs which\\ncompensated for their inferiority in numbers. They lacked, however, what\\nthe country party possessed, a generous ideal of life. Though many of them\\nwere connected with the Presbyterian system, their common sense made them\\nrevolt from its rigidity, while at the same time their economical\\nprinciples failed to supply them with any standard that could satisfy the\\nimagination. Sir Andrew Freeport excites in us less interest than any\\nmember of the Spectator\\'s Club. There was not yet constituted among the\\nupper middle classes that mixed conception of good feeling, good breeding,\\nand good taste which we now attach to the name of \"gentleman.\"\\n\\nTwo main currents of opinion divided the country, to one of which a man\\nwas obliged to surrender himself if he wished to enjoy the pleasures of\\norganised society. One of these was Puritanism, but this was undoubtedly\\nthe less popular, or at least the less fashionable. A protracted\\nexperience of Roundhead tyranny under the Long Parliament had inclined the\\nnation to believe that almost any form of Government was preferable to\\nthat of the Saints. The Puritan, no longer the mere sectarian, as in the\\ndays of Elizabeth and James I., somewhat ridiculous in the extravagance of\\nhis opinions, but respectable from the constancy with which he maintained\\nthem, had ruled over them as a taskmaster, and had forced them, as far as\\nhe could by military violence, to practise the asceticism to which monks\\nand nuns had voluntarily submitted themselves. The most innocent as well\\nas the most brutal diversions of the people were sacrificed to his\\nspiritual pride. As Macaulay well says, he hated bear-baiting, not because\\nit gave pain to the bear, but because it gave pleasure to the spectator.\\nThe tendency of his creed was, in fact, anti-social. Beauty in his eyes\\nwas a snare, and pleasure a sin; the only mode of social intercourse which\\nhe approved was a sermon.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the habits of the Court, which gave the tone to all\\npolite society, were almost equally distasteful to the instincts of the\\npeople. It was inevitable that the inclinations of Charles II. should be\\nviolently opposed to every sentiment of the Puritans. While he was in the\\npower of the Scots he had been forced into feigned compliance with\\nPresbyterian rites; the Puritans had put his father to death, and had\\ncondemned himself to many years of exile and hardship in Catholic\\ncountries. He had returned to his own land half French in his political\\nand religious sympathies, and entirely so in his literary tastes. To\\nconvert and to corrupt those of his subjects who immediately surrounded\\nhim was an easy matter. \"All by the king\\'s example lived and loved.\"\\nPoets, painters, and actors were forward to promote principles viewed\\nwith favour by their sovereign and not at all disagreeable to themselves.\\nAn ingenious philosopher elevated Absolutism into an intellectual and\\nmoral system, the consequence of which was to encourage the powerful in\\nthe indulgence of every selfish instinct. As the Puritans had oppressed\\nthe country with a system of inhuman religion and transcendental morality,\\nso now, in order to get as far from Puritanism as possible, it seemed\\nnecessary for every one aspiring to be thought a gentleman to avow himself\\nan atheist or a debauchee.\\n\\nThe ideas of the man in the mode after the Restoration are excellently hit\\noff in one of the fictitious letters in the _Spectator_:\\n\\n    \"I am now between fifty and sixty, and had the honour to be well with\\n    the first men of taste and gallantry in the joyous reign of Charles\\n    the Second. As for yourself, Mr. Spectator, you seem with the utmost\\n    arrogance to undermine the very fundamentals upon which we conducted\\n    ourselves. It is monstrous to set up for a man of wit and yet deny\\n    that honour in a woman is anything but peevishness, that inclination\\n    is not the best rule of life, or virtue and vice anything else but\\n    health and disease. We had no more to do but to put a lady in a good\\n    humour, and all we could wish followed of course. Then, again, your\\n    Tully and your discourses of another life are the very bane of mirth\\n    and good humour. Prythee, don\\'t value thyself on thy reason at that\\n    exorbitant rate and the dignity of human nature; take my word for it,\\n    a setting dog has as good reason as any man in England.\"[2]\\n\\nWhile opinions, which from different sides struck at the very roots of\\nsociety, prevailed both in the fashionable and religious portions of the\\ncommunity, it was inevitable that Taste should be hopelessly corrupt. All\\nthe artistic and literary forms which the Court favoured were of the\\nromantic order, but it was romance from which beauty and vitality had\\nutterly disappeared. Of the two great principles of ancient chivalry, Love\\nand Honour, the last notes of which are heard in the lyrics of Lovelace\\nand Montrose, one was now held to be non-existent, and the other was\\nutterly perverted. The feudal spirit had surrounded woman with an\\natmosphere of mystical devotion, but in the reign of Charles II. the\\npassion of love was subjected to the torturing treatment then known as\\n\"wit.\" Cowley and Waller seem to think that when a man is in love the\\nenergy of his feelings is best shown by discovering resemblances between\\nhis mistress and those objects in nature to which she is apparently most\\nunlike.\\n\\nThe ideal of Woman, as she is represented in the _Spectator_, adding\\ngrace, charity, and refinement to domestic life, had still to be created.\\nThe king himself, the presumed mirror of good taste, was notoriously under\\nthe control of his numerous mistresses; and the highest notion of love\\nwhich he could conceive was gallantry. French romances were therefore\\ngenerally in vogue. All the casuistry of love which had been elaborated by\\nMademoiselle de Scudery was reproduced with improvements by Mrs. Aphra\\nBehn. At the same time, as usually happens in diseased societies, there\\nwas a general longing to cultivate the simplicity of the Golden Age, and\\nthe consequence was that no person, even in the lower grades of society,\\nwho pretended to any reading, ever thought of making love in his own\\nperson. The proper tone of feeling was not acquired till he had invested\\nhimself with the pastoral attributes of Damon and Celadon, and had\\naddressed his future wife as Amarantha or Phyllis.\\n\\nThe tragedies of the period illustrate this general inclination to\\nspurious romance. If ever there was a time when the ideal of monarchy was\\ndegraded, and the instincts of chivalrous action discouraged, it was in\\nthe reign of Charles II. Absorbed as he was in the pursuit of pleasure,\\nthe king scarcely attempted to conceal his weariness when obliged to\\nattend to affairs of State. He allowed the Dutch fleet to approach his\\ncapital and to burn his own ships of war on the Thames; he sold Dunkirk to\\nthe French; hardly any action in his life evinces any sense of patriotism\\nor honour. And yet we have only to glance at Johnson\\'s _Life of Dryden_ to\\nsee how all the tragedies of the time turn on the great characters, the\\ngreat actions, the great sufferings of princes. The Elizabethan drama had\\nexhibited man in every degree of life and with every variety of character;\\nthe playwright of the Restoration seldom descended below such themes as\\nthe conquest of Mexico or Granada, the fortunes of the Great Mogul, and\\nthe fate of Hannibal. This monotony of subject was doubtless in part the\\nresult of policy, for in pitying the fortunes of Montezuma the imagination\\nof the spectator insensibly recalled those of Charles the Second.\\n\\nEverything in these tragedies is unreal, strained, and affected. In order\\nto remove them as far as possible from the language of ordinary life they\\nare written in rhyme, while the astonishment of the audience is raised\\nwith big swelling words, which vainly seek to hide the absence of genuine\\nfeeling. The heroes tear their passion to tatters because they think it\\nheroic to do so; their flights into the sublime generally drop into the\\nridiculous; instead of holding up the mirror to nature, their object is to\\ndepart as far as possible from common sense. Nothing exhibits more\\ncharacteristically the utterly artificial feeling, both of the dramatists\\nand the spectators, than the habit which then prevailed of dismissing the\\naudience after a tragic play with a witty epilogue. On one occasion, Nell\\nGwynne, in the character of St. Catherine, was, at the end of the play,\\nleft for dead upon the stage. Her body having to be removed, the actress\\nsuddenly started to her feet, exclaiming,\\n\\n  \"Hold! are you mad? you damned confounded dog,\\n  I am to rise and speak the epilogue!\"[3]\\n\\nBy way of compensation, however, the writers of the period poured forth\\ntheir real feelings without reserve in their comedies. So great, indeed,\\nis the gulf that separates our own manners from theirs, that some critics\\nhave endeavoured to defend the comic dramatists of the Restoration against\\nthe moralists on the ground that their representations of Nature are\\nentirely devoid of reality. Charles Lamb, who loved all curiosities, and\\nthe Caroline comedians among the number, says of them:\\n\\n    \"They are a world of themselves almost as much as fairy-land. Take one\\n    of their characters, male or female (with few exceptions they are\\n    alike), and place it in a modern play, and my virtuous indignation\\n    shall rise against the profligate wretch as warmly as the Catos of the\\n    pit could desire, because in a modern play I am to judge of the right\\n    and the wrong. The standard of _police_ is the measure of _political\\n    justice_. The atmosphere will blight it; it cannot live here. It has\\n    got into a moral world, where it has no business, from which it must\\n    needs fall headlong--as dizzy and incapable of making a stand as a\\n    Swedenborgian bad spirit that has wandered unawares into his sphere of\\n    Good Men or Angels. But in its own world do we feel the creature is so\\n    very bad? The Fainalls and Mirabels, the Dorimants and Lady\\n    Touchwoods, in their own sphere do not offend my moral sense; in fact,\\n    they do not appeal to it at all. They seem engaged in their proper\\n    element. They break through no laws or conscientious restraints. They\\n    know of none. They have got out of Christendom into the land of-what\\n    shall I call it?--of cuckoldry--the Utopia of gallantry, where\\n    pleasure is duty and the manners perfect freedom. It is altogether a\\n    speculative scene of things, which has no reference whatever to the\\n    world that is.\"\\n\\nThis is a very happy description of the manner in which the plays of\\nEtherege, Shadwell, Wycherley, and Congreve affect us to-day; and it is no\\ndoubt superfluous to expend much moral indignation on works which have\\nlong since lost their power to charm: comedies in which the reader finds\\nneither the horseplay of Aristophanes, nor the nature of Terence, nor the\\npoetry of Shakespeare; in which there is not a single character that\\narouses interest, or a situation that spontaneously provokes laughter; in\\nwhich the complications of plot are produced by the devices of fine\\ngentlemen for making cuckolds of citizens, and the artifices of wives to\\ndupe their husbands; in which the profuse wit of the dialogue might excite\\nadmiration, if it were possible to feel the smallest interest in the\\noccasion that produced it. But to argue that these plays never represented\\nany state of existing society is a paradox which chooses to leave out of\\naccount the contemporary attack on the stage made by Jeremy Collier, the\\nadmissions of Dryden, and all those valuable glimpses into the manners of\\nour ancestors which are afforded by the prologues of the period.\\n\\nIt is sufficient to quote against Lamb the witty and severe criticism of\\nSteele in the _Spectator_, upon Etherege\\'s _Man of the Mode_:\\n\\n    \"It cannot be denied but that the negligence of everything which\\n    engages the attention of the sober and valuable part of mankind\\n    appears very well drawn in this piece. But it is denied that it is\\n    necessary to the character of a fine gentleman that he should in that\\n    manner trample upon all order and decency. As for the character of\\n    Dorimant, it is more of a coxcomb than that of Fopling. He says of one\\n    of his companions that a good correspondence between them is their\\n    mutual interest. Speaking of that friend, he declares their being much\\n    together \\'makes the women think the better of his understanding, and\\n    judge more favourably of my reputation. It makes him pass upon some\\n    for a man of very good sense, and me upon others for a very civil\\n    person.\\' This whole celebrated piece is a perfect contradiction to\\n    good manners, good sense, and common honesty; and as there is nothing\\n    in it but what is built upon the ruin of virtue and innocence,\\n    according to the notion of virtue in this comedy, I take the shoemaker\\n    to be in reality the fine gentleman of the play; for it seems he is an\\n    atheist, if we may depend upon his character as given by the\\n    orange-woman, who is herself far from being the lowest in the play.\\n    She says of a fine man who is Dorimant\\'s companion, \\'there is not such\\n    another heathen in the town except the shoemaker.\\' His pretension to\\n    be the hero of the drama appears still more in his own description of\\n    his way of living with his lady. \\'There is,\\' says he, \\'never a man in\\n    the town lives more like a gentleman with his wife than I do. I never\\n    mind her motions; she never inquires into mine. We speak to one\\n    another civilly; hate one another heartily; and, because it is vulgar\\n    to lie and soak together, we have each of us our several settle-beds.\\'\\n\\n    \"That of \\'soaking together\\' is as good as if Dorimant had spoken it\\n    himself; and I think, since he puts human nature in as ugly a form as\\n    the circumstances will bear, and is a staunch unbeliever, he is very\\n    much wronged in having no part of the good fortune bestowed in the\\n    last act. To speak plain of this whole work, I think nothing but being\\n    lost to a sense of innocence and virtue can make any one see this\\n    comedy without observing more frequent occasion to move sorrow and\\n    indignation than mirth and laughter. At the same time I allow it to be\\n    nature, but it is nature in its utmost corruption and degeneracy.\"[4]\\n\\nThe truth is, that the stage after the Restoration reflects only too\\nfaithfully the manners and the sentiments of the only society which at\\nthat period could boast of anything like organisation. The press, which\\nnow enables public opinion to exercise so powerful a control over the\\nmanners of the times, had then scarcely an existence. No standard of\\nfemale honour restrained the license of wit and debauchery. If the clergy\\nwere shocked at the propagation of ideas so contrary to the whole spirit\\nof Christianity, their natural impulse to reprove them was checked by the\\nfear that an apparent condemnation of the practices of the Court might end\\nin the triumph of their old enemies, the Puritans. All the elements of an\\nold and decaying form of society that tended to atheism, cynicism, and\\ndissolute living, exhibited themselves, therefore, in naked shamelessness\\non the stage. The audiences in the theatres were equally devoid of good\\nmanners and good taste; they did not hesitate to interrupt the actors in\\nthe midst of a serious play, while they loudly applauded their obscene\\nallusions. So gross was the character of comic dialogue that women could\\nnot venture to appear at a comedy without masks, and under these\\ncircumstances the theatre became the natural centre for assignations. In\\nsuch an atmosphere women readily cast off all modesty and reserve; indeed,\\nthe choicest indecencies of the times are to be found in the epilogues to\\nthe plays, which were always assigned to the female actors.\\n\\nIt at first sight seems remarkable that a society inveterately corrupt\\nshould have contained in itself such powers of purification and vitality\\nas to discard the literary garbage of the Restoration period in favour of\\nthe refined sobriety which characterises the writers of Queen Anne\\'s\\nreign. But, in fact, the spread of the infection was confined within\\ncertain well-marked limits. The Court moved in a sphere apart, and was\\naltogether too light and frivolous to exert a decided moral influence on\\nthe great body of the nation. The country gentlemen, busied on their\\nestates, came seldom to town; the citizens, the lawyers, and the members\\nof the other professions steadily avoided the theatre, and regarded with\\nequal contempt the moral and literary excesses of the courtiers. Among\\nthis class, unrepresented at present in the world of letters, except,\\nperhaps, by antiquarians like Selden, the foundations of sound taste were\\nbeing silently laid. The readers of the nation had hitherto been almost\\nlimited to the nobility. Books were generally published by subscription,\\nand were dependent for their success on the favour with which they were\\nreceived by the courtiers. But, after the subsidence of the Civil War, the\\nnation began to make rapid strides in wealth and refinement, and the\\nmoneyed classes sought for intellectual amusement in their leisure hours.\\nAuthors by degrees found that they might look for readers beyond the\\nselect circle of their aristocratic patrons; and the book-seller, who had\\nhitherto calculated his profits merely by the commission he might obtain\\non the sale of books, soon perceived that they were becoming valuable as\\nproperty. The reign of Charles II. is remarkable not only for the great\\nincrease in the number of the licensed printers in London, but for the\\nappearance of the first of the race of modern publishers, Jacob Tonson.\\n\\nThe portion of society whose tastes the publishers undertook to satisfy\\nwas chiefly interested in history, poetry, and criticism. It was this for\\nwhich Dryden composed his _Miscellany_, this to which he addressed the\\nadmirable critical essays which precede his _Translations from the Latin\\nPoets_ and his _Versifications of Chaucer_, and this which afterwards gave\\nthe main support to the _Tatler_ and the _Spectator_. Ignorant of the\\nwritings of the great classical authors, as well as of the usages of\\npolite society, these men were nevertheless robust and manly in their\\nideas, and were eager to form for themselves a correct standard of taste\\nby reference to the best authorities. Though they turned with repugnance\\nfrom the playhouse and from the morals of the Court, they could not\\navoid being insensibly affected by the tone of grace and elegance which\\nprevailed in Court circles. And in this respect, if in no other, our\\ngratitude is due to the Caroline dramatists, who may justly claim to be\\nthe founders of the _social_ prose style in English literature. Before\\nthem English prose had been employed, no doubt, with music and majesty by\\nmany writers; but the style of these is scarcely representative; they had\\nused the language for their own elevated purposes, without, however,\\nattempting to give it that balanced fineness and subtlety which makes it a\\nfitting instrument for conveying the complex ideas of an advanced stage of\\nsociety. Dryden, Wycherley, and their followers, impelled by the taste of\\nthe Court to study the French language, brought to English composition a\\nnicer standard of logic and a more choice selection of language, while the\\nnecessity of pleasing their audiences with brilliant dialogue made them\\ncareful to give their sentences that well-poised structure which Addison\\nafterwards carried to perfection in the _Spectator_.\\n\\nBy this brief sketch the reader may be enabled to judge of the distracted\\nstate of society, both in politics and taste, in the reign of Charles II.\\nOn the one side, the Monarchical element in the Constitution was\\nrepresented by the Court Party, flushed with the recent restoration;\\nretaining the old ideas and principles of absolutism which had prevailed\\nunder James I., without being able to perceive their inapplicability to\\nthe existing nature of things; feeding its imagination alternately on\\nsentiments derived from the decayed spirit of chivalry, and on artistic\\nrepresentations of fashionable debauchery in its most open form--a party\\nwhich, while it fortunately preserved the traditions of wit, elegance, and\\ngaiety of style, seemed unaware that these qualities could be put to any\\nother use than the mitigation of an intolerable _ennui_. On the other\\nside, the rising power of Democracy found its representatives in austere\\nRepublicans opposed to all institutions in Church and State that seemed to\\nobstruct their own abstract principles of government; gloomy fanatics,\\nwho, with an intense intellectual appreciation of eternal principles of\\nreligion and morality, sought to sacrifice to their system the most\\npermanent and even innocent instincts of human nature. Between the two\\nextreme parties was the unorganised body of the nation, grouped round old\\ncustoms and institutions, rapidly growing in wealth and numbers, conscious\\nof the rise in their midst of new social principles, but perplexed how to\\nreconcile these with time-honoured methods of religious, political, and\\nliterary thought. To lay the foundations of sound opinion among the people\\nat large; to prove that reconciliation was possible between principles\\nhitherto exhibited only in mutual antagonism; to show that under the\\nEnglish Constitution monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy might all be\\nharmonised, that humanity was not absolutely incompatible with religion or\\nmorality with art, was the task of the statesmen, and still more of the\\nmen of letters, of the early part of the eighteenth century.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nADDISON\\'S FAMILY AND EDUCATION.\\n\\n\\nJoseph Addison was born on the 1st of May, 1672. He was the eldest son of\\nLancelot Addison, at the time of his birth rector of Milston, near\\nAmesbury, in Wiltshire, and afterwards Dean of Lichfield. His father was a\\nman of character and accomplishments. Educated at Oxford, while that\\nUniversity was under the control of the famous Puritan Visitation, he made\\nno secret of his contempt for principles to which he was forced to submit,\\nor of his preferences for Monarchy and Episcopacy. His boldness was not\\nagreeable to the University authorities, and being forced to leave Oxford,\\nhe maintained himself for a time near Petworth, in Sussex, by acting as\\nchaplain or tutor in families attached to the Royalist cause. After the\\nRestoration he obtained the appointment of chaplain to the garrison of\\nDunkirk, and when that town was ceded to France in 1662, he was removed in\\na similar capacity to Tangier. Here he remained eight years, but,\\nventuring on a visit to England, his post was bestowed upon another, and\\nhe would have been left without resources had not one of his friends\\npresented him with the living of Milston, valued at £120 a year. With the\\ncourage of his order he thereupon took a wife, Jane, daughter of Dr.\\nNathaniel Gulston, and sister of William Gulston, Bishop of Bristol, by\\nwhom he had six children, three sons and three daughters, all born at\\nMilston. In 1675 he was made a prebendary of Salisbury Cathedral and\\nChaplain-in-Ordinary to the King; and in 1683 he was promoted to the\\nDeanery of Lichfield, as a reward for his services at Tangier, and out of\\nconsideration of losses which he had sustained by a fire at Milston. His\\nliterary reputation stood high, and it is said that he would have been\\nmade a bishop, if his old zeal for legitimacy had not prompted him to\\nmanifest in the Convocation of 1689 his hostility to the Revolution. He\\ndied in 1703.\\n\\nLancelot was a writer at once voluminous and lively. In the latter part of\\nhis life he produced several treatises on theological subjects, the most\\npopular of which was called _An Introduction to the Sacrament_. This book\\npassed through many editions. The doctrine it contains leans rather to the\\nLow Church side. But much the most characteristic of his writings were his\\nworks on Mahommedanism and Judaism, the results of his studies during his\\nresidence in Barbary. These show not only considerable industry and\\nresearch and powers of shrewd observation, but that genuine literary\\nfaculty which enables a writer to leave upon a subject of a general nature\\nthe impression of his own character. While there is nothing forced or\\nexaggerated in his historical style, a vein of allegory runs through the\\nnarrative of the _Revolutions of the Kingdoms of Fez and Morocco_, which\\nmust have had a piquant flavour for the orthodox English reader of that\\nday. Recollections of the Protectorate would have taken nothing of its\\nvividness from the portrait of the Moorish priest who \"began to grow into\\nreputation with the people by reason of his high pretensions to piety and\\nfervent zeal for their law, illustrated by a stubborn rigidity of\\nconversation and outward sanctity of life.\" When the Zeriffe, with\\nambitious designs on the throne, sent his sons on a pilgrimage to Mecca,\\nthe religious buffooneries practised by the young men must have recalled\\nto the reader circumstances more recent and personal than those which the\\nauthor was apparently describing. \"Much was the reverence and reputation\\nof holiness which they thereby acquired among the superstitious people,\\nwho could hardly be kept from kissing their garments and adoring them as\\nsaints, while they failed not in their parts, but acted as much devotion\\nas high contemplative looks, deep sighs, tragical gestures, and other\\npassionate interjections of holiness could express. \\'Allah, allah!\\' was\\ntheir doleful note, their sustenance the people\\'s alms.\" And when these\\nimpostors had inveigled the King of Fez into a religious war, the\\ndescription of those who \"mistrusted their own safety, and began, but too\\nlate, to repent their approving of an armed hypocrisy,\" was not more\\napplicable to the rulers of Barbary than to the people of England. \"Puffed\\nup with their successes, they forgot their obedience, and these saints\\ndenied the king the fifth part of their spoils.... By which it appeared\\nthat they took up arms, not out of love for their country and zeal for\\ntheir religion, but out of desire of rule.\" There is, indeed, nothing in\\nthese utterances which need have prevented the writer from consistently\\npromoting the Revolution of 1688; yet his principles seem to have carried\\nhim far in the opposite direction; and it is interesting to remember that\\nthe assertor in Convocation of the doctrine of indefeasible hereditary\\nright was the father of the author of the _Whig Examiner_ and the\\n_Freeholder_. However decidedly Joseph may have dissented from his\\nfather\\'s political creed, we know that he entertained admiration and\\nrespect for his memory, and that death alone prevented him from\\ncompleting the monument afterwards erected in Lancelot\\'s honour in\\nLichfield Cathedral.\\n\\nOf Addison\\'s mother nothing of importance is recorded. His second brother,\\nGulston, became Governor of Fort St. George, in the East Indies; and the\\nthird, Lancelot, followed in Joseph\\'s footsteps so far as to obtain a\\nFellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford. His sisters, Jane and Anna, died\\nyoung; but Dorothy was twice married, and Swift records in her honour that\\nshe was \"a kind of wit, and very like her brother.\" We may readily believe\\nthat a writer so lively as Lancelot would have had clever children, but\\nSteele was perhaps carried away by the zeal of friendship or the love of\\nepigram when he said, in his dedication to the _Drummer_: \"Mr. Dean\\nAddison left behind him four children, each of whom, for excellent talents\\nand singular perfections, was as much above the ordinary world as their\\nbrother Joseph was above them.\" But that Steele had a sincere admiration\\nfor the whole family is sufficiently shown by his using them as an example\\nin one of his early _Tatlers_:\\n\\n    \"I remember among all my acquaintance but one man whom I have thought\\n    to live with his children with equanimity and a good grace. He had\\n    three sons and one daughter, whom he bred with all the care imaginable\\n    in a liberal and ingenuous way. I have often heard him say he had the\\n    weakness to love one much better than the other, but that he took as\\n    much pains to correct that as any other criminal passion that could\\n    arise in his mind. His method was to make it the only pretension in\\n    his children to his favour to be kind to each other, and he would tell\\n    them that he who was the best brother he would reckon the best son.\\n    This turned their thoughts into an emulation for the superiority in\\n    kind and tender affection towards each other. The boys behaved\\n    themselves very early with a manly friendship; and their sister,\\n    instead of the gross familiarities and impertinent freedoms in\\n    behaviour usual in other houses, was always treated by them with as\\n    much complaisance as any other young lady of their acquaintance. It\\n    was an unspeakable pleasure to visit or sit at a meal in that family.\\n    I have often seen the old man\\'s heart flow at his eyes with joy upon\\n    occasions which would appear indifferent to such as were strangers to\\n    the turn of his mind; but a very slight accident, wherein he saw his\\n    children\\'s good-will to one another, created in him the god-like\\n    pleasure of loving them because they loved each other. This great\\n    command of himself in hiding his first impulse to partiality at last\\n    improved to a steady justice towards them, and that which at first was\\n    but an expedient to correct his weakness was afterwards the measure of\\n    his virtue.\"[5]\\n\\nThis, no doubt, is the set description of a moralist, and to an age in\\nwhich the liberty of manners has grown into something like license it may\\nsavour of formalism and priggishness; but when we remember that the writer\\nwas one of the most warm-hearted of men, and that the subject of his\\npanegyric was himself, full of vivacity and impulse, it must be admitted\\nthat the picture which it gives us of the Addison family in the rectory of\\nMilston is a particularly amiable one.\\n\\nThough the eighteenth century had little of that feeling for natural\\nbeauty which distinguishes our own, a man of Addison\\'s imagination could\\nhardly fail to be impressed by the character of the scenery in which his\\nchildhood was passed. No one who has travelled on a summer\\'s day across\\nSalisbury plain, with its vast canopy of sky and its open tracts of\\nundulating downland, relieved by no shadows except such as are thrown by\\nthe passing cloud, the grazing sheep, and the great circle of Stonehenge,\\nwill forget the delightful sense of refreshment and repose produced by the\\ndescent into the valley of the Avon. The sounds of human life rising from\\nthe villages after the long solitude of the plain, the shade of the deep\\nwoods, the coolness of the river, like all streams rising in the chalk,\\nclear and peaceful, are equally delicious to the sense and the\\nimagination. It was, doubtless, the recollection of these scenes that\\ninspired Addison in his paraphrase of the twenty-third Psalm:\\n\\n  \"The Lord my pasture shall prepare,\\n  And feed me with a shepherd\\'s care.\\n\\n     *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n  When in the sultry glebe I faint,\\n  Or on the thirsty mountain pant,\\n  To fertile vales and dewy meads\\n  My weary wandering steps he leads,\\n  Where peaceful rivers, soft and slow,\\n  Amid the verdant landscape flow.\"\\n\\nAt Amesbury he was first sent to school, his master being one Nash; and\\nhere, too, he probably met with the first recorded adventure of his life.\\nIt is said that having committed some fault, and being fearful of the\\nconsequences, he ran away from school, and, taking up his abode in a\\nhollow tree, maintained himself as he could till he was discovered and\\nbrought back to his parents. He was removed from Amesbury to Salisbury,\\nand thence to the Grammar School at Lichfield, where he is said to have\\nbeen the leader in a \"barring out.\" From Lichfield he passed to the\\nCharter House, then under the charge of Dr. Ellis, a man of taste and\\nscholarship. The Charter House at that period was, after Westminster, the\\nbest-known school in England, and here was laid the foundation of that\\nsound classical taste which perfected the style of the essays in the\\n_Spectator_.\\n\\nMacaulay labours with much force and ingenuity to prove that Addison\\'s\\nclassical acquirements were only superficial, and, in his usual\\nepigrammatic manner, hazards the opinion that \"his knowledge of Greek,\\nthough doubtless such as was, in his time, thought respectable at Oxford,\\nwas evidently less than that which many lads now carry away every year\\nfrom Eton and Rugby.\" That Addison was not a scholar of the class of\\nBentley or Porson may be readily admitted. But many scattered allusions in\\nhis works prove that his acquaintance with the Greek poets of every\\nperiod, if cursory, was wide and intelligent: he was sufficiently master\\nof the language thoroughly to understand the spirit of what he read; he\\nundertook while at Oxford a translation of Herodotus, and one of the\\npapers in the _Spectator_ is a direct imitation of a _jeu d\\'esprit_ of\\nLucian\\'s. The Eton or Rugby boy who, in these days, with a normal appetite\\nfor cricket and football, acquired an equal knowledge of Greek literature,\\nwould certainly be somewhat of a prodigy.\\n\\nNo doubt, however, Addison\\'s knowledge of the Latin poets was, as Macaulay\\ninfers, far more extensive and profound. It would have been strange had it\\nbeen otherwise. The influence of the classical side of the Italian\\nRenaissance was now at its height, and wherever those ideas became\\nparamount Latin composition was held in at least as much esteem as poetry\\nin the vernacular. Especially was this the case in England, where certain\\naffinities of character and temperament made it easy for writers to adopt\\nRoman habits of thought. Latin verse composition soon took firm root in\\nthe public schools and universities, so that clever boys of the period\\nwere tolerably familiar with most of the minor Roman poets. Pope, in the\\nFourth Book of the _Dunciad_, vehemently attacked the tradition as\\nconfining the mind to the study of words rather than of things; but he had\\nhimself had no experience of a public school, and only those who fail to\\nappreciate the influence of Latin verse composition on the style of our\\nown greatest orators, and of poets like Milton and Gray, will be inclined\\nto undervalue it as an instrument of social and literary training.\\n\\nProficiency in this art may at least be said to have laid the foundation\\nof Addison\\'s fortunes. Leaving the Charter House in 1687, at the early age\\nof fifteen, he was entered at Queen\\'s College, Oxford, and remained a\\nmember of that society for two years, when a copy of his Latin verses fell\\ninto the hands of Dr. Lancaster, then Fellow and afterwards Provost of the\\nCollege. Struck with their excellence, Lancaster used his influence to\\nobtain for him a demyship at Magdalen. The subject of this fortunate set\\nof verses was \"Inauguratio Regis Gulielmi,\" from which fact we may\\nreasonably infer that even in his boyhood his mind had acquired a Whig\\nbias. Whatever inclination he may have had in this direction would have\\nbeen confirmed by the associations of his new college. The fluctuations of\\nopinion in Magdalen had been frequent and extraordinary. Towards the close\\nof Elizabeth\\'s reign it was notorious for its Calvinism, but under the\\nChancellorship of Laud it appears to have adopted, with equal ardour, the\\ncause of Arminianism, for it was among the colleges that offered the\\nstoutest opposition to the Puritan visitors in 1647-48. The despotic\\ntendencies of James II., however, again cooled its loyalty, and its\\nspirited resistance to the king\\'s order for the election of a Roman\\nCatholic President had given a mortal blow to the Stuart dynasty. Hough\\nwas now President, but in consequence of the dispute with the king there\\nhad been no election of demies in 1688, so that twice the usual number was\\nchosen in the following year, and the occasion was distinguished by the\\nname of the \"golden election.\" From Magdalen Addison proceeded to his\\nmaster\\'s degree in 1693; the College elected him probationary Fellow in\\n1697, and actual Fellow the year after. He retained his Fellowship till\\n1711.\\n\\nOf his tastes, habits, and friendships at Oxford there are few records.\\nAmong his acquaintance were Boulter, afterwards Archbishop of\\nDublin--whose memory is unenviably perpetuated, in company with Ambrose\\nPhillips, in Pope\\'s _Epistle to Arbuthnot_,\\n\\n  \"Does not one table Bavius still admit,\\n  Still to one Bishop Phillips seem a wit?\"--\\n\\nand possibly the famous Sacheverell.[6] He is said to have shown in the\\nsociety of Magdalen some of the shyness that afterwards distinguished him;\\nhe kept late hours, and read chiefly after dinner. The walk under the\\nwell-known elms by the Cherwell is still connected with his name. Though\\nhe probably acted as tutor in the college, the greater part of his quiet\\nlife at the University was doubtless occupied in study. A proof of his\\nearly maturity is seen in the fact that, in his nineteenth year, a young\\nman of birth and fortune, Mr. Rushout, who was being educated at Magdalen,\\nwas placed under his charge.\\n\\nHis reputation as a scholar and a man of taste soon extended itself to the\\nworld of letters in London. In 1693, being then in his twenty-second year,\\nhe wrote his _Account of the Greatest English Poets_; and about the same\\ntime he addressed a short copy of verses to Dryden, complimenting him on\\nthe enduring vigour of his poetical faculty, as shown in his translations\\nof Virgil and other Latin poets, some of which had recently appeared in\\nTonson\\'s _Miscellany_. The old poet appears to have been highly gratified,\\nand to have welcomed the advances thus made to him, for he returned\\nAddison\\'s compliment by bestowing high and not unmerited praise on the\\ntranslation of the Fourth Book of the _Georgics_, which the latter soon\\nafter undertook, and by printing, as a preface to his own translation, a\\ndiscourse written by Addison on the _Georgics_, as well as arguments to\\nmost of the books of the _Æneid_.\\n\\nThrough Dryden, no doubt, he became acquainted with Jacob Tonson. The\\nfather of English publishing had for some time been a well-known figure in\\nthe literary world. He had purchased the copyright of _Paradise Lost_; he\\nhad associated himself with Dryden in publishing before the Revolution two\\nvolumes of _Miscellanies_; encouraged by the success which these obtained,\\nhe put the poet, in 1693, on some translations of Juvenal and Persius, and\\ntwo new volumes of _Miscellanies_; while in 1697 he urged him to undertake\\na translation of the whole of the works of Virgil. Observing how strongly\\nthe public taste set towards the great classical writers, he was anxious\\nto employ men of ability in the work of turning them into English; and it\\nappears from existing correspondence that he engaged Addison, while the\\nlatter was at Oxford, to superintend a translation of Herodotus. He also\\nsuggested a translation of Ovid. Addison undertook to procure coadjutors\\nfor the work of translating the Greek historian. He himself actually\\ntranslated the books called _Polymnia_ and _Urania_, but for some\\nunexplained reason the work was never published. For Ovid he seems, on the\\nwhole, to have had less inclination. At Tonson\\'s instance he translated\\nthe Second Book of the _Metamorphoses_, which was first printed in the\\nvolume of _Miscellanies_ that appeared in 1697; but he wrote to the\\npublisher that \"Ovid had so many silly stories with his good ones that he\\nwas more tedious to translate than a better poet would be.\" His study of\\nOvid, however, was of the greatest use in developing his critical faculty;\\nthe excesses and want of judgment in that poet forced him to reflect, and\\nhis observations on the style of his author anticipate his excellent\\nremarks on the difference between True and False Wit in the sixty-second\\nnumber of the _Spectator_.\\n\\nWhoever, indeed, compares these notes with the _Essay on the Georgics_,\\nand with the opinions expressed in the _Account of the English Poets_,\\nwill be convinced that the foundations of his critical method were laid at\\nthis period (1697). In the _Essay on the Georgics_ he seems to be timid in\\nthe presence of Virgil\\'s superiority; his _Account of the English Poets_,\\nbesides being impregnated with the principles of taste prevalent after the\\nRestoration, shows deficient powers of perception and appreciation. The\\nname of Shakespeare is not mentioned in it, Dryden and Congreve alone\\nbeing selected to represent the drama. Chaucer is described as \"a merry\\nbard,\" whose humour has become obsolete through time and change; while the\\nrich pictorial fancy of the _Faery Queen_ is thus described:\\n\\n  \"Old Spenser next, warmed with poetic rage,\\n  In ancient tales amused a barbarous age--\\n  An age that yet uncultivate and rude,\\n  Where\\'er the poet\\'s fancy led pursued,\\n  Through pathless fields and unfrequented floods,\\n  To dens of dragons and enchanted woods.\\n  But now the mystic tale, that pleased of yore,\\n  Can charm an understanding age no more;\\n  The long-spun allegories fulsome grow,\\n  While the dull moral lies too plain below.\"\\n\\nAccording to Pope--always a suspicious witness where Addison is\\nconcerned--he had not read Spenser when he wrote this criticism on him.[7]\\n\\nMilton, as a legitimate successor of the classics, is of course\\nappreciated, but not at all after the elaborate fashion of the\\n_Spectator_; to Dryden, the most distinguished poet of the day, deserved\\ncompliments are paid, but their value is lessened by the exaggerated\\nopinion which the writer entertains of Cowley, who is described as a\\n\"mighty genius,\" and is praised for the inexhaustible riches of his\\nimagination. Throughout the poem, in fact, we observe a remarkable\\nconfusion of various veins of thought; an unjust depreciation of the\\nGothic grandeur of the older English poets; a just admiration for the\\nGreek and Roman authors; a sense of the necessity of good sense and\\nregularity in writings composed for an \"understanding age;\" and at the\\nsame time a lingering taste for the forced invention and far-fetched\\nconceits that mark the decay of the spirit of mediæval chivalry.\\n\\nWith the judgments expressed in this performance it is instructive to\\ncompare such criticisms on Shakespeare as we find in No. 42 of the\\n_Spectator_, the papers on \"Chevy Chase\" (73, 74), and particularly the\\nfollowing passage:\\n\\n    \"As true wit consists in the resemblance of ideas, and false wit in\\n    the resemblance of words, according to the foregoing instances, there\\n    is another kind of wit which consists partly in the resemblance of\\n    ideas and partly in the resemblance of words, which, for distinction\\'s\\n    sake, I shall call mixed wit. This kind of wit is that which abounds\\n    in Cowley more than in any author that ever wrote. Mr. Waller has\\n    likewise a great deal of it. Mr. Dryden is very sparing in it. Milton\\n    has a genius much above it. _Spenser is in the same class with\\n    Milton._ The Italians even in their epic poetry are full of it.\\n    Monsieur Boileau, who formed himself upon the ancient poets, has\\n    everywhere rejected it with scorn. If we look after mixed wit among\\n    the Greeks, we shall find it nowhere but in the epigrammatists. There\\n    are, indeed, some strokes of it in the little poem ascribed to Musæus,\\n    which by that, as well as many other marks, betrays itself to be a\\n    modern composition. If we look into the Latin writers we find none of\\n    this mixed wit in Virgil, Lucretius, or Catullus; very little in\\n    Horace, but a great deal of it in Ovid, and scarce anything else in\\n    Martial.\"\\n\\nThe stepping-stone from the immaturity of the early criticisms in the\\n_Account of the Greatest English Poets_ to the finished ease of the\\n_Spectator_ is to be found in the notes to the translation of Ovid.[8]\\n\\nThe time came when he was obliged to form a decision affecting the entire\\ncourse of his life. Tonson, who had a wide acquaintance, no doubt\\nintroduced him to Congreve and the leading men of letters in London, and\\nthrough them he was presented to Somers and Montague. Those ministers\\nperhaps persuaded him, as a point of etiquette, to write, in 1695, his\\n_Address to King William_, a poem composed in a vein of orthodox\\nhyperbole, all of which must have been completely thrown away on that most\\nunpoetical of monarchs. Yet in spite of those seductions Addison lingered\\nat Oxford. To retain his Fellowship it was necessary for him to take\\norders. Had he done so, there can be no doubt that his literary skill and\\nhis value as a political partizan would have opened for him a road to the\\nhighest preferment. At that time the clergy were far from thinking it\\nunbecoming to their cloth to fight in the political arena or to take part\\nin journalism. Swift would have been advanced to a bishopric, as a reward\\nfor his political services, if it had not been for the prejudice\\nentertained towards him by Queen Anne; Boulter, rector of St. Saviour\\'s,\\nSouthwark, having made himself conspicuous by editing a paper called the\\n_Freethinker_, was raised to the Primacy of Ireland; Hoadley, the\\nnotorious Bishop of Bangor, edited the _London Journal_; the honours that\\nwere awarded to two men of such second-rate intellectual capacity would\\nhardly have been denied to Addison. He was inclined in this direction by\\nthe example and advice of his father, who was now Dean of Lichfield, and\\nwho was urgent on his son to rid himself of the pecuniary embarrassments\\nin which he was involved by embracing the Church as a profession. A few\\nyears before he had himself seemed to look upon the Church as his future\\nsphere. In his _Account of the Greatest English Poets_ he says:\\n\\n  \"I leave the arts of poetry and verse\\n  To them that practise them with more success.\\n  Of greater truths I\\'ll now propose to tell,\\n  And so at once, dear friend and muse, farewell.\"\\n\\nHad he followed up his intention we might have known the name of Addison\\nas that of an artful controversialist, and perhaps as a famous writer of\\nsermons; but we should, in all probability, have never heard of the\\n_Spectator_.\\n\\nFortunately for English letters, other influences prevailed to give a\\ndifferent direction to his fortunes. It is true that Tickell, Addison\\'s\\nearliest biographer, states that his determination not to take orders was\\nthe result of his own habitual self-distrust, and of a fear of the\\nresponsibilities which the clerical office would involve. But Steele, who\\nwas better acquainted with his friend\\'s private history, on reading\\nTickell\\'s Memoir, addressed a letter to Congreve on the subject, in which\\nhe says:\\n\\n    \"These, you know very well, were not the reasons which made Mr.\\n    Addison turn his thoughts to the civil world; and, as you were the\\n    instrument of his becoming acquainted with Lord Halifax, I doubt not\\n    but you remember the warm instances that noble lord made to the head\\n    of the College not to insist upon Mr. Addison\\'s going into orders. His\\n    arguments were founded upon the general pravity and corruption of men\\n    of business, who wanted liberal education. And I remember, as if I had\\n    read the letter yesterday, that my lord ended with a compliment that,\\n    however he might be represented as a friend to the Church, he never\\n    would do it any other injury than keeping Mr. Addison out of it.\"\\n\\nNo doubt the real motive of the interest in Addison shown by Lord Halifax,\\nat that time known as Charles Montague, was an anxiety which he shared\\nwith all the leading statesmen of the period, and of which more will be\\nsaid presently, to secure for his party the services of the ablest\\nwriters. Finding his _protégé_ as yet hardly qualified to transact affairs\\nof State, he joined with Lord Somers, who had also fixed his eyes on\\nAddison, in soliciting for him from the Crown, in 1699, a pension of £300\\na year, which might enable him to supplement his literary accomplishments\\nwith the practical experience of travel. Addison naturally embraced the\\noffer. He looked forward to studying the political institutions of foreign\\ncountries, to seeing the spots of which he had read in his favourite\\nclassical authors, and to meeting the most famous men of letters on the\\nContinent.\\n\\nIt is characteristic both of his own tastes and of his age that he seems\\nto have thought his best passport to intellectual society abroad would be\\nhis Latin poems. His verses on the _Peace of Ryswick_, written in 1697\\nand dedicated to Montague, had already procured him great reputation, and\\nhad been praised by Edmund Smith--a high authority--as \"the best Latin\\npoem since the _Æneid_.\" This gave him the opportunity of collecting his\\nvarious compositions of the same kind, and in 1699 he published from the\\nSheldonian Press a second volume of the _Musæ Anglicanæ_--the first having\\nappeared in 1691--containing poems by various Oxford scholars. Among the\\ncontributors were Hannes, one of the many scholarly physicians of the\\nperiod; J. Philips, the author of the _Splendid Shilling_; and Alsop, a\\nprominent antagonist of Bentley, whose Horatian humour is celebrated by\\nPope in the _Dunciad_.[9]\\n\\nBut the most interesting of the names in the volume is that of the once\\ncelebrated Edmond, commonly called \"Rag,\" Smith, author of the _Ode on the\\nDeath of Dr. Pocock_, who seems to have been among Addison\\'s intimate\\nacquaintance, and deserves to be recollected in connection with him on\\naccount of a certain similarity in their genius and the extraordinary\\ndifference in their fortunes. \"Rag\" was a man of fine accomplishments and\\ngraceful humour, but, like other scholars of the same class, indolent and\\nlicentious. In spite of great indulgence extended to him by the\\nauthorities of Christ Church, he was expelled from the University in\\nconsequence of his irregularities. His friends stood by him, and, through\\nthe interest of Addison, a proposal was made to him to undertake a history\\nof the Revolution, which, however, from political scruples he felt himself\\nobliged to decline. Like Addison, he wrote a tragedy modelled on classical\\nlines; but, as it had no political significance, it only pleased the\\ncritics, without, like \"Cato,\" interesting the public. Like Addison, too,\\nhe had an opportunity of profiting by the patronage of Halifax, but\\nlaziness or whim prevented him from keeping an appointment which the\\nlatter had made with him, and caused him to miss a place worth £300 a\\nyear. Addison, by his own exertions, rose to posts of honour and profit,\\nand towards the close of his life became Secretary of State. Smith envied\\nhis advancement, and, ignoring the fact that his own failure was entirely\\ndue to himself, murmured at fortune for leaving him in poverty. Yet he\\nestimated his wants at £600 a year, and died of indulgence when he can\\nscarcely have been more than forty years of age.\\n\\nAddison\\'s compositions in the _Musæ Anglicanæ_ are eight in number. All of\\nthem are distinguished by the ease and flow of the versification, but they\\nare generally wanting in originality. The best of them is the\\n_Pygmæo-Gerano-Machia_, which is also interesting as showing traces of\\nthat rich vein of humour which Addison worked out in the _Tatler_ and\\n_Spectator_. The mock-heroic style in prose and verse was sedulously\\ncultivated in England throughout the eighteenth century. Swift, Pope,\\nArbuthnot, and Fielding, developed it in various forms; but Addison\\'s\\nLatin poem is perhaps the first composition in which the fine fancy and\\ninvention afterwards shown in the _Rape of the Lock_ and _Gulliver\\'s\\nTravels_ conspicuously displayed itself.\\n\\nA literary success of this kind at that epoch gave a writer a wider\\nreputation than he could gain by compositions in his own language. Armed,\\ntherefore, with copies of the _Musæ Anglicanæ_ for presentation to\\nscholars, and with Halifax\\'s recommendatory letters to men of political\\ndistinction, Addison started for the Continent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nADDISON ON HIS TRAVELS.\\n\\n\\nTravelling in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries involved an amount\\nof thought and precaution which would have seemed inconvenient to the\\ntourist accustomed to abandon himself to the authority of guide-books,\\ncouriers, and railway companies. By ardent spirits like Roderick Random it\\nwas regarded as the sphere of enterprise and fortune, and not without\\nreason, in days when adventures were to be met with on almost every road\\nin the country, and in the streets and inns of the towns. The graver\\nportion of society, on the other hand, considered it as part of the\\nregular course of education through which every young man of position\\nought to pass before entering into active life. French was the universally\\nrecognised language of diplomacy. French manners and conversation were\\nconsidered to be the best school for politeness, while Italy was held in\\nthe highest respect by the northern nations as the source of revived art\\nand letters. Some of the most distinguished Englishmen of the time looked,\\nit is true, with little favour on this fashionable training. \"Lord\\nCowper,\" says Spence, on the information of Dr. Conybeare, \"on his\\ndeath-bed ordered that his son should never travel (it is by the absolute\\ndesire of the Queen that he does). He ordered this from a good deal of\\nobservation on its effects; he had found that there was little to be\\nhoped, and much to be feared, from travelling. Atwell, who is the young\\nlord\\'s tutor abroad, gives but a very discouraging account of it, too, in\\nhis letters, and seems to think that people are sent out too young, and\\nare too hasty to find any great good from it.\"\\n\\nOn some of the stronger and more enthusiastic minds the chief effect of\\nthe grand tour was to produce a violent hatred of all foreign manners.\\nDennis, the critic, for instance, who, after leaving Cambridge, spent some\\ntime on the Continent, returned with a confirmed dislike to the French,\\nand ostentatiously displayed in his writings how much he held \"dragoons\\nand wooden shoes in scorn;\" and it is amusing to find Addison at a later\\ndate making his Tory fox-hunter declare this anti-Gallican temper to be\\nthe main fruits of foreign travel.\\n\\nBut, in general, what was intended to be a school for manners and\\npolitical instruction proved rather a source of unsettlement and\\ndissipation; and the vigorous and glowing lines in which Pope makes the\\ntutor describe to Dullness the doings of the \"young Æneas\" abroad, may be\\ntaken as a faithful picture of the travelled pupil of the period:\\n\\n  \"Intrepid then o\\'er seas and land he flew;\\n  Europe he saw, and Europe saw him too.\\n  There all thy gifts and graces we display,\\n  Thou, only thou, directing all our way!\\n  To where the Seine, obsequious as she runs,\\n  Pours at great Bourbon\\'s feet her silken sons;\\n  Or Tyber, now no longer Roman, rolls,\\n  Vain of Italian arts, Italian souls:\\n  To happy convents bosomed deep in vines,\\n  Where slumber abbots purple as their wines:\\n  To isles of fragrance, lily-silvered vales,\\n  Diffusing languor in the panting gales:\\n  To lands of singing or of dancing slaves,\\n  Love-whispering woods, and lute-resounding waves.\\n  But chief her shrine where naked Venus keeps,\\n  And Cupids ride the lion of the deeps;\\n  Where, eased of fleets, the Adriatic main\\n  Wafts the smooth eunuch and enamoured swain.\\n  Led by my hand, he sauntered Europe round,\\n  And gathered every vice on Christian ground;\\n  Saw every court, heard every king declare\\n  His royal sense of operas or the fair;\\n  The stews and palace equally explored,\\n  Intrigued with glory, and with spirit whored;\\n  Tried all _hors-d\\'oeuvres_, all liqueurs defined,\\n  Judicious drank, and greatly daring dined;\\n  Dropped the dull lumber of the Latin store,\\n  Spoiled his own language, and acquired no more;\\n  All classic learning lost on classic ground;\\n  And last turned air, the echo of a sound.\"\\n\\nIt is needless to say that Addison\\'s experiences of travel were of a very\\ndifferent kind. He left England in his twenty-eighth year, with a mind\\nwell equipped from a study of the best authors, and with the intention of\\nqualifying himself for political employment at home, after familiarising\\nhimself with the languages and manners of foreign countries. His sojourn\\nabroad extended over four years, and his experience was more than usually\\nvaried and comprehensive. Crossing from Dover to Calais, some time in the\\nsummer of 1699, he spent nearly eighteen months in France making himself\\nmaster of the language. In December, 1700, he embarked at Marseilles for a\\ntour in Italy, and visited in succession the following places: Monaco,\\nGenoa, Pavia, Milan, Brescia, Verona, Padua, Venice, Ferrara, Ravenna,\\nRimini, S. Marino, Pesaro, Fano, Sinigaglia, Ancona, Loreto, Rome (where,\\nas it was his intention to return, he only visited St. Peter\\'s and the\\nPantheon), Naples, Capri, whence he came back to Rome by sea, the various\\ntowns in the neighbourhood of Rome, Siena, Leghorn, Pisa, Lucca, Florence,\\nBologna, Modena, Parma, and Turin. Thus, in the course of this journey,\\nwhich lasted exactly a twelvemonth, he twice crossed the Apennines, and\\nmade acquaintance with all the more important cities in the northern part\\nof the Peninsula. In December, 1701, he passed over Mont Cenis to Geneva,\\nproceeding then by Fribourg, Berne, Soleure, Zurich, St. Gall, Linden,\\nInsbruck, Hall, to Vienna, where he arrived in the autumn of 1702. After\\nmaking a brief stay in the Austrian capital he turned his face homewards,\\nand having visited the Protestant cities of Germany, and made a rather\\nlonger stay in Hamburg than in any other, he reached Holland in the spring\\nof 1703, and remained in that country till his return to England, some\\ntime in the autumn of the same year.\\n\\nDuring his journey he made notes for his _Remarks on Italy_, which he\\npublished immediately on his return home, and he amused himself, while\\ncrossing Mont Cenis, with composing his _Letter to Lord Halifax_, which\\ncontains, perhaps, the best verses he ever wrote. Though the ground over\\nwhich he passed was well trodden, and though he possessed none of the\\nspecial knowledge which gives value to the observations of travellers like\\nArthur Young, yet his remarks on the people and places he saw are the\\nproduct of an original mind, and his illustrations of his route from the\\nLatin poets are remarkably happy and graceful. It is interesting, also, to\\nobserve how many of the thoughts and suggestions which occurred to him on\\nthe road are afterwards worked up into papers for the _Spectator_.\\n\\nWhen Addison landed in France, in 1699, the power of Louis XIV., so long\\nthe determined enemy of the English Revolution of 1688, had passed its\\nclimax. The Peace of Ryswick, by which the hopes of the Jacobites were\\nfinally demolished, was two years old. The king, disappointed in his\\ndreams of boundless military glory, had fallen into a fit of devotion, and\\nAddison, arriving from England with a very imperfect knowledge of the\\nlanguage, was astonished to find the whole of French literature saturated\\nwith the royal taste. \"As for the state of learning,\" says he, in a letter\\nto Montague, dated August, 1699, \"there is no book comes out at present\\nthat has not something in it of an air of devotion. Dacier has bin forced\\nto prove his Plato a very good Christian before he ventures upon his\\ntranslation, and has so far comply\\'d with y{e} tast of the age that his\\nwhole book is overrun with texts of Scripture, and y{e} notion of\\npræ-existence, supposed to be stolen from two verses of y{e} prophets.\\nNay, y{e} humour is grown so universal that it is got among y{e} poets,\\nwho are every day publishing Lives of Saints and Legends in Rhime.\"\\n\\nFinding, perhaps, that the conversation at the capital was not very\\ncongenial to his taste, he seems to have hurried on to Blois, a town then\\nnoted for the purity with which its inhabitants spoke the French language,\\nand where he had determined to make his temporary abode. His only record\\nof his first impressions of Paris is a casual criticism of \"y{e} King\\'s\\nStatue that is lately set up in the Place Vendome.\" He visited, however,\\nboth Versailles and Fontainebleau, and the preference which he gives to\\nthe latter (in a letter to Congreve) is interesting, as anticipating that\\ntaste for natural as opposed to artificial beauty which he afterwards\\nexpressed in the _Spectator_.\\n\\n    \"I don\\'t believe, as good a poet as you are, that you can make finer\\n    Lanskips than those about the King\\'s houses, or with all yo{r}\\n    descriptions build a more magnificent palace than Versailles. I am,\\n    however, so singular as to prefer Fontainebleau to the rest. It is\\n    situated among rocks and woods that give you a fine variety of Savage\\n    prospects. The King has Humoured the Genius of the place, and only\\n    made of so much art as is necessary to Help and regulate Nature,\\n    without reforming her too much. The Cascades seem to break through the\\n    Clefts and Cracks of Rocks that are covered over with Moss, and look\\n    as if they were piled upon one another by Accident. There is an\\n    artificial wildness in the Meadows, Walks, and Canals, and y{e}\\n    Garden, instead of a Wall, is Fenced on the Lower End by a Natural\\n    Mound of Rock-work that strikes the eye very agreeably. For my part, I\\n    think there is something more charming in these rude heaps of Stone\\n    than in so many Statues, and wou\\'d as soon see a River winding through\\n    Woods and Meadows as when it is tossed up in such a variety of figures\\n    at Versailles.\"[10]\\n\\nHere and there, too, his correspondence exhibits traces of that delicate\\nvein of ridicule in which he is without a rival, as in the following\\ninimitable description of Le Brun\\'s paintings at Versailles:\\n\\n    \"The painter has represented his most Xtian Majesty under y{e} figure\\n    of Jupiter throwing thunderbolts all about the ceiling, and striking\\n    terror into y{e} Danube and Rhine, that lie astonished and blasted a\\n    little above the Cornice.\"\\n\\nOf his life at Blois a very slight sketch has been preserved by the Abbe\\nPhilippeaux, one of the many gossipping informants from whom Spence\\ncollected his anecdotes:\\n\\n    \"Mr. Addison stayed above a year at Blois. He would rise as early as\\n    between two and three in summer, and lie abed till between eleven and\\n    twelve in the depth of winter. He was untalkative while here, and\\n    often thoughtful; sometimes so lost in thought that I have come into\\n    his room and have stayed five minutes there before he has known\\n    anything of it. He had his masters generally at supper with him, kept\\n    very little company beside, and had no amour whilst here that I know\\n    of, and I think I should have known it if he had had any.\"\\n\\nThe following characteristic letter to a gentleman of Blois, with whom he\\nseems to have had an altercation, is interesting as showing the mixture of\\ncoolness and dignity, the \"blood and judgment well commingled\" which\\nHamlet praised in Horatio, and which are conspicuous in all Addison\\'s\\nactions as well as in his writings:\\n\\n    \"Sir,--I am always as slow in making an Enemy as a Friend, and am\\n    therefore very ready to come to an Accommodation with you; but as for\\n    any satisfaction, I don\\'t think it is due on either side when y{e}\\n    Affront is mutual. You know very well that according to y{e} opinion\\n    of y{e} world a man would as soon be called a Knave as a Fool, and I\\n    believe most people w{d} be rather thought to want Legs than Brains.\\n    But I suppose whatever we said in y{e} heat of discourse is not y{e}\\n    real opinion we have of each other, since otherwise you would have\\n    scorned to subscribe yourself as I do at present, S{r}, y{r} very,\\n    etc.\\n\\n      A. Mons{r} L\\'Espagnol,\\n        Blois, 10{br} 1699.\"\\n\\nThe length of Addison\\'s sojourn at Blois seems to have been partly caused\\nby the difficulty he experienced, owing to the defectiveness of his\\nmemory, in mastering the language. Finding himself at last able to\\nconverse easily, he returned to Paris some time in the autumn of 1700, in\\norder to see a little of polite society there before starting on his\\ntravels in Italy. He found the best company in the capital among the men\\nof letters, and he makes especial mention of Malebranche, whom he\\ndescribes as solicitous about the adequate rendering of his works into\\nEnglish; and of Boileau, who, having now survived almost all his literary\\nfriends, seems, in his conversation with Addison, to have been even more\\nthan usually splenetic in his judgments on his contemporaries. The old\\npoet and critic was, however, propitiated with the present of the _Musæ\\nAnglicanæ_; and, according to Tickell, said \"that he did not question\\nthere were excellent compositions in the native language of a country that\\npossessed the Roman genius in so eminent a degree.\"\\n\\nIn general, Addison\\'s remarks on the French character are not\\ncomplimentary. He found the vanity of the people so elated by the\\nelevation of the Duke of Anjou to the throne of Spain that they were\\ninsupportable, and he felt no reluctance to quit France for Italy. His\\nobservations on the national manners, as seen at Blois, are\\ncharacteristic:\\n\\n    \"Truly, by what I have yet seen, they are the Happiest nation in the\\n    world. \\'Tis not in the pow\\'r of Want or Slavery to make \\'em miserable.\\n    There is nothing to be met with in the Country but Mirth and Poverty.\\n    Ev\\'ry one sings, laughs, and starves. Their Conversation is generally\\n    Agreeable; for if they have any Wit or Sense they are sure to show it.\\n    They never mend upon a Second meeting, but use all the freedom and\\n    familiarity at first Sight that a long Intimacy or Abundance of wine\\n    can scarce draw from an Englishman. Their Women are perfect Mistresses\\n    in this Art of showing themselves to the best Advantage. They are\\n    always gay and sprightly, and set off y{e} worst faces in Europe with\\n    y{e} best airs. Ev\\'ry one knows how to give herself as charming a look\\n    and posture as S{r} Godfrey Kneller c{d} draw her in.\"[11]\\n\\nHe embarked from Marseilles for Genoa in December, 1700, having as his\\ncompanion Edward Wortley Montague, whom Pope satirises under the various\\nnames of Shylock, Worldly, and Avidien. It is unnecessary to follow him\\nstep by step in his travels, but the reader of his _Letter to Lord\\nHalifax_ may still enjoy the delight and enthusiasm to which he gives\\nutterance on finding himself among the scenes described in his favourite\\nauthors:\\n\\n  \"Poetic fields encompass me around,\\n  And still I seem to tread on classic ground;\\n  For here the Muse so oft her harp has strung,\\n  That not a mountain rears its head unsung;\\n  Renowned in verse each shady thicket grows,\\n  And every stream in heavenly numbers flows.\"[12]\\n\\nThe phrase \"classic ground,\" which has become proverbial, is first used in\\nthese verses, and, as will have been observed, Pope repeats it with\\nevident reference to the above passage in his satire on the travels of the\\n\"young Æneas.\" Addison seems to have carried the Latin poets with him, and\\nhis quotations from them are abundant and apposite. When he is driven into\\nthe harbour at Monaco, he remembers Lucan\\'s description of its safety and\\nshelter; as he passes under Monte Circeo, he feels that Virgil\\'s\\ndescription of Æneas\\'s voyage by the same spot can never be sufficiently\\nadmired; he recalls, as he crosses the Apennines, the fine lines of\\nClaudian recording the march of Honorius from Ravenna to Rome; and he\\ndelights to think that at the falls of the Velino he can still see the\\n\"angry goddess\" of the _Æneid_ (Alecto) \"thus sinking, as it were, in a\\ntempest, and plunging herself into Hell\" amidst such a scene of horror and\\nconfusion.\\n\\nHis enthusiastic appreciation of the classics, which caused him in judging\\nany work of art to look, in the first place, for regularity of design and\\nsimplicity of effect, shows it self characteristically in his remarks on\\nthe Lombard and German styles of architecture in Italy. Of Milan Cathedral\\nhe speaks without much admiration, but he was impressed with the wonders\\nof the Certosa near Pavia. \"I saw,\" says he, \"between Pavia and Milan the\\nconvent of the Carthusians, which is very spacious and beautiful. Their\\nchurch is very fine and curiously adorned, _but_ of a Gothic structure.\"\\nHis most interesting criticism, however, is that on the Duomo at Siena:\\n\\n    \"When a man sees the prodigious pains and expense that our forefathers\\n    have been at in these barbarous buildings, one cannot but fancy to\\n    himself what miracles of architecture they would have left us had they\\n    only been instructed in the right way; for, when the devotion of those\\n    ages was much warmer than that of the present, and the riches of the\\n    people much more at the disposal of the priests, there was so much\\n    money consumed on these Gothic cathedrals as would have finished a\\n    greater variety of noble buildings than have been raised either before\\n    or since that time. One would wonder to see the vast labour that has\\n    been laid out on this single cathedral. The very spouts are loaden\\n    with ornaments, the windows are formed like so many scenes of\\n    perspective, with a multitude of little pillars retiring behind one\\n    another, the great columns are finely engraven with fruits and\\n    foliage, that run twisting about them from the very top to the bottom;\\n    the whole body of the church is chequered with different lays of black\\n    and white marble, the pavement curiously cut out in designs and\\n    Scripture stories, and the front covered with such a variety of\\n    figures, and overrun with so many mazes and little labyrinths of\\n    sculpture, that nothing in the world can make a prettier show to those\\n    who prefer false beauties and _affected ornaments_ to a noble and\\n    majestic simplicity.\"[13]\\n\\nAddison had not reached that large liberality in criticism afterwards\\nattained by Sir Joshua Reynolds, who, while insisting that in all art\\nthere was but _one_ true style, nevertheless allowed very high merit to\\nwhat he called the _characteristic_ styles. Sir Joshua would never have\\nfallen into the error of imputing affectation to such simple and honest\\nworkmen as the early architects of Northern Italy. The effects of\\nAddison\\'s classical training are also very visible in his descriptions of\\nnatural scenery. There is in these nothing of that craving melancholy\\nproduced by a sense of the infinity of nature which came into vogue after\\nthe French Revolution; no projection of the feelings of the spectator into\\nthe external scene on which he gazes; nor, on the other hand, is there any\\nattempt to rival the art of the painter by presenting a landscape in words\\ninstead of in colours. He looks on nature with the same clear sight as the\\nGreek and Roman writers, and in describing a scene he selects those\\nparticulars in it which he thinks best adapted to arouse pleasurable\\nimages in the mind of the reader. Take, for instance, the following\\nexcellent description of his passage over the Apennines:\\n\\n    \"The fatigue of our crossing the Apennines, and of our whole journey\\n    from Loretto to Rome, was very agreeably relieved by the variety of\\n    scenes we passed through. For, not to mention the rude prospect of\\n    rocks rising one above another, of the deep gutters worn in the sides\\n    of them by torrents of rain and snow-water, or the long channels of\\n    sand winding about their bottoms that are sometimes filled with so\\n    many rivers, we saw in six days\\' travelling the several seasons of the\\n    year in their beauty and perfection. We were sometimes shivering on\\n    the top of a bleak mountain, and a little while afterwards basking in\\n    a warm valley, covered with violets and almond-trees in blossom, the\\n    bees already swarming over them, though but in the month of February.\\n    Sometimes our road led us through groves of olives, or by gardens of\\n    oranges, or into several hollow apartments among the rocks and\\n    mountains, that look like so many natural greenhouses, as being always\\n    shaded with a great variety of trees and shrubs that never lose their\\n    verdure.\"[14]\\n\\nThough his thoughts during his travels were largely occupied with objects\\nchiefly interesting to his taste and imagination, and though he busied\\nhimself with such compositions as the _Epistle from Italy_, the _Dialogue\\non Medals_, and the first four acts of _Cato_, he did not forget that his\\nexperience was intended to qualify him for taking part in the affairs of\\nState. And when he reached Geneva, in December, 1701, the door to a\\npolitical career seemed to be on the point of opening. He there learned,\\nas Tickell informs us, that he had been selected to attend the army under\\nPrince Eugene as secretary from the King. He accordingly waited in the\\ncity for official confirmation of this intelligence; but his hopes were\\ndoomed to disappointment. William III. died in March, 1702; Halifax, on\\nwhom Addison\\'s prospects chiefly depended, was struck off the Privy\\nCouncil by Queen Anne; and the travelling pension ceased with the life of\\nthe sovereign who had granted it. Henceforth he had to trust to his own\\nresources; and though the loss of his pension does not seem to have\\ncompelled him at once to turn homewards, as he continued on his route to\\nVienna, yet an incident that occurred towards the close of his travels\\nshows that he was prepared to eke out his income by undertaking work that\\nwould have been naturally irksome to him.\\n\\nAt Rotterdam, on his return towards England, he met with Jacob Tonson, the\\nbookseller, for whom, as has been said, he had already done some work as a\\ntranslator. Tonson was one of the founders of the Kit-Kat Club, and in\\nthat capacity was brought into frequent and intimate connection with the\\nWhig magnates of the day. Among these was the Duke of Somerset, who,\\nthrough his wife, then high in Queen Anne\\'s favour, exercised considerable\\ninfluence on the course of affairs. The Duke required a tutor for his\\nson, Lord Hertford, and Tonson recommended Addison. On the Duke\\'s approval\\nof the recommendation, the bookseller seems to have communicated with\\nAddison, who expressed himself, in general terms, as willing to undertake\\nthe charge of Lord Hertford, but desired to know more particulars about\\nhis engagement. These were furnished by the Duke in a letter to Tonson,\\nand they are certainly a very curious illustration of the manners of the\\nperiod. \"I ought,\" says his Grace, \"to enter into that affair more freely\\nand more plainly, and tell you what I propose, and what I hope he will\\ncomply with--viz., I desire he may be more on the account of a companion\\nin my son\\'s travels than as a governor, and that as such I shall account\\nhim: my meaning is, that neither lodging, travelling, nor diet shall cost\\nhim sixpence, and over and above that my son shall present him at the\\nyear\\'s end with a hundred guineas, as long as he is pleased to continue in\\nthat service to my son, by his personal attendance and advice, in what he\\nfinds necessary during his time of travelling.\"\\n\\nTo this not very tempting proposal Addison replied: \"I have lately\\nreceived one or two advantageous offers of y{e} same nature, but as I\\nshould be very ambitious of executing any of your Grace\\'s commands, so I\\ncan\\'t think of taking y{e} like employ from any other hands. As for y{e}\\nrecompense that is proposed to me, I must take the liberty to assure your\\nGrace that I should not see my account in it, but in y{e} hope that I have\\nto recommend myself to your Grace\\'s favour and approbation.\" This reply\\nproved highly offensive to the Duke, who seems to have considered his own\\noffer a magnificent one. \"Your letter of the 16th,\" he writes to Tonson,\\non June 22, 1703, \"with one from Mr. Addison, came safe to me. You say he\\nwill give me an account of his readiness of complying with my proposal. I\\nwill set down his own words, which are thus: \\'As for the recompense that\\nis proposed to me, I must confess I can by no means see my account in it,\\'\\netc. All the other parts of his letter are compliments to me, which he\\nthought he was bound in good breeding to write, and as such I have taken\\nthem, and no otherwise; and now I leave you to judge how ready he is to\\ncomply with my proposal. Therefore, I have wrote by this first post to\\nprevent his coming to England on my account, and have told him plainly\\nthat I must look for another, which I cannot be long a-finding.\"\\n\\nAddison\\'s principal biographer, Miss Aikin, expresses great contempt for\\nthe niggardliness of the Duke, and says that, \"Addison must often have\\ncongratulated himself in the sequel on that exertion of proper spirit by\\nwhich he had escaped from wasting, in an attendance little better than\\nservile, three precious years, which he found means of employing so much\\nmore to his own honour and satisfaction, and to the advantage of the\\npublic.\" Mean as the Duke\\'s offer was, it is nevertheless plain that\\nAddison really intended to accept it, and, this being so, he can scarcely\\nbe congratulated on having on this occasion displayed his usual tact and\\nfelicity. Two courses appear to have been open to him. He might either\\nhave simply declined the offer \"as not finding his account in it,\" or he\\nmight have accepted it in view of the future advantages which he hoped to\\nderive from the Duke\\'s \"favour and approbation;\" in which case he should\\nhave said nothing about finding the \"recompense\" proposed insufficient. By\\nthe course that he took he contrived to miss an appointment which he seems\\nto have made up his mind to accept, and he offended an influential\\nstatesman whose favour he was anxious to secure.\\n\\nTo his pecuniary embarrassments was soon added domestic loss. At Amsterdam\\nhe received news of his father\\'s death, and it may be supposed that the\\nprivate business in which he must have been involved in consequence of\\nthis event brought him to England, where he arrived some time in the\\nautumn of 1703.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nHIS EMPLOYMENT IN AFFAIRS OF STATE.\\n\\n\\nAddison\\'s fortunes were now at their lowest ebb. The party from which he\\nhad looked for preferment was out of office; his chief political patron\\nwas in particular discredit at Court; his means were so reduced that he\\nwas forced to adopt a style of living not much more splendid than that of\\nthe poorest inhabitants of Grub Street. Yet within three years of his\\nreturn to England he was promoted to be an Under-Secretary of State--a\\npost from which he mounted to one position of honour after another till\\nhis final retirement from political life. That he was able to take\\nadvantage of the opportunity that offered itself was owing to his own\\ngenius and capacity; the opportunity was the fruit of circumstances which\\nhad produced an entire revolution in the position of English men of\\nletters.\\n\\nThrough the greater part of Charles II.\\'s reign the profession of\\nliterature was miserably degraded. It is true that the King himself, a man\\nof wit and taste, was not slow in his appreciation of art; but he was by\\nhis character insensible to what was serious or elevated, and the poetry\\nof gallantry, which he preferred, was quite within reach of the courtiers\\nby whom he was surrounded. Rochester, Buckingham, Sedley, and Dorset are\\namong the principal poetical names of the period; all of them being well\\nqualified to shine in verse, the chief requirements of which were a\\ncertain grace of manner, an air of fashionable breeding, and a complete\\ndisregard of the laws of decency. Besides these \"songs by persons of\\nquality,\" the principal entertainment was provided by the drama. But the\\nstage, seldom a lucrative profession, was then crowded with writers whose\\nfertile, if not very lofty, invention kept down the price of plays. Otway,\\nthe most successful dramatist of his time, died in a state of indigence,\\nand as some say, almost of starvation, while playwrights of less ability,\\nif the house was ill-attended on the third night, when the poet received\\nall the profits of the performance, were forced, as Oldham says, \"to\\nstarve or live in tatters all the year.\"[15]\\n\\nPeriodical literature, in the shape of journals and magazines, had as yet\\nno existence; nor could the satirical poet or the pamphleteer find his\\nremuneration in controversial writing the strong reaction against\\nPuritanism having raised the monarchy to a position in which it was\\npractically secure against the assaults of all its enemies. The author of\\nthe most brilliant satire of the period, who had used all the powers of a\\nrich imagination to discredit the Puritan and Republican cause, was paid\\nwith nothing more solid than admiration, and died neglected and in want.\\n\\n  \"The wretch, at summing up his misspent days,\\n  Found nothing left but poverty and praise!\\n  Of all his gains by verse he could not save\\n  Enough to purchase flannel and a grave!\\n  Reduced to want he in due time fell sick,\\n  Was fain to die, and be interred on tick;\\n  And well might bless the fever that was sent\\n  To rid him hence, and his worse fate prevent.\"[16]\\n\\nIn the latter part of this reign, however, a new combination of\\ncircumstances produced a great change in the character of English\\nliterature and in the position of its professors. The struggle of Parties\\nrecommenced. Wearied with the intolerable rule of the Saints, the nation\\nhad been at first glad to leave its newly-restored King to his pleasures,\\nbut, as the memories of the Commonwealth became fainter, the people\\nwatched with a growing feeling of disgust the selfishness and extravagance\\nof the Court, while the scandalous sale of Dunkirk and the sight of the\\nDutch fleet on the Thames made them think of the patriotic energies which\\nCromwell had succeeded in arousing. At the same time the thinly-disguised\\ninclination of the King to Popery, and the avowed opinions of his brother,\\nraised a general feeling of alarm for the Protestant liberties of the\\nnation. On the other hand, the Puritans, taught moderation by adversity,\\nexhibited the really religious side of their character, and attracted\\ntowards themselves a considerable portion of the aristocracy, as well as\\nof the commercial and professional classes in the metropolis--a\\ncombination of interests which helped to form the nucleus of the Whig\\nparty. The clergy and the landed proprietors, who had been the chief\\nsufferers from Parliamentary rule, naturally adhered to the Court, and\\nwere nicknamed by their opponents Tories. Violent party conflicts ensued,\\nmarked by such incidents as the Test Act, the Exclusion Bill, the\\nintrigues of Monmouth, the Popish Plot, and the trial and acquittal of\\nShaftesbury on the charge of high treason.\\n\\nFinding his position no longer so easy as at his restoration, Charles\\nnaturally bethought him of calling literature to his assistance. The\\nstage, being completely under his control, seemed the readiest instrument\\nfor his purpose; the order went forth, and an astonishing display of\\nmonarchical fervour in all the chief dramatists of the time--Otway,\\nDryden, Lee, and Crowne--was the result. Shadwell, who was himself\\ninclined to the Whig interest, laments the change:\\n\\n  \"The stage, like old Rump pulpits, is become\\n  The scene of News, a furious Party\\'s drum.\"\\n\\nBut the political influence of the drama and the audience to which it\\nappealed being necessarily limited, the King sought for more powerful\\nliterary artillery, and he found it in the serviceable genius of Dryden,\\nwhose satirical and controversial poems date from this period. The wide\\npopularity of _Absalom and Achitophel_, written against Monmouth and\\nShaftesbury; of _The Medal_, satirising the acquittal of Shaftesbury; of\\n_The Hind and Panther_, composed to advance the Romanising projects of\\nJames II.; points to the vast influence exercised by literature in the\\nparty struggle. Nevertheless, in spite of all that Dryden had done for the\\nRoyal cause, in spite of the fact that he himself had more than once\\nappealed to the poet for assistance, the ingratitude or levity of Charles\\nwas so inveterate that he let the poet\\'s services go almost unrequited.\\nDryden, it is true, held the posts of Laureate and Royal Historiographer,\\nbut his salary was always in arrears, and the letter which he addressed to\\nRochester, First Lord of the Treasury, asking for six months\\' payment of\\nwhat was due to him, tells its own story.\\n\\nJames II. cared nothing for literature, and was probably too dull of\\napprehension to understand the incalculable service that Dryden had\\nrendered to his cause. He showed his appreciation of the Poet-Laureate\\'s\\ngenius by deducting £100 from the salary which his brother had promised\\nhim, and by cutting off from the emoluments of the office the\\ntime-honoured butt of canary!\\n\\nUnder William III. the complexion of affairs again altered. The Court, in\\nthe old sense of the word, ceased to be a paramount influence in\\nliterature. William III. derived his authority from Parliament; he knew\\nthat he must support it mainly by his sword and his statesmanship. A\\nstranger to England, its manners and its language, he showed little\\ndisposition to encourage letters. Pope, indeed, maliciously suggests that\\nhe had the bad taste to admire the poetry of Blackmore, whom he knighted;\\nbut, as a matter of fact, the honour was conferred on the worthy Sir\\nRichard in consequence of his distinction in medicine, and he himself\\nbears witness to William\\'s contempt for poetry.\\n\\n  \"Reverse of Louis he, example rare,\\n  Loved to deserve the praise he could not bear.\\n  He shunned the acclamations of the throng,\\n  And always coldly heard the poet\\'s song.\\n  Hence the great King the Muses did neglect,\\n  And the mere poet met with small respect.\"[17]\\n\\nSuch political verse as we find in this reign generally consists, like\\nHalifax\\'s _Epistle to Lord Dorset_, or Addison\\'s own _Address to King\\nWilliam_, of hyperbolical flattery. Opposition was extinct, for both\\nparties had for the moment united to promote the Revolution, and the only\\ndiscordant notes amid the chorus of adulation proceeded from Jacobite\\nwriters concealed in the garrets and cellars of Grub Street. Such an\\natmosphere was not favorable to the production of literature of an\\nelevated or even of a characteristic order.\\n\\nAddison\\'s return to England coincided most happily with another remarkable\\nturn of the tide. Leaning decidedly to the Tory party, who were now\\nstrongly leavened with the Jacobite element, Anne had not long succeeded\\nto the throne before she seized an opportunity for dismissing the Whig\\nMinistry whom she found in possession of office. The Whigs, equally\\nalarmed at the influence acquired by their rivals, and at the danger which\\nthreatened the Protestant succession, neglected no effort to\\ncounterbalance the loss of their sovereign\\'s favour by strengthening their\\ncredit with the people. Having been trained in a school which had at least\\nqualified them to appreciate the influence of style, the aristocratic\\nleaders of the party were well aware of the advantages they would derive\\nby attracting to themselves the services of the ablest writers of the day.\\nHence they made it their policy to mingle with men of letters on an equal\\nfooting, and to hold out to them an expectation of a share in the\\nadvantages to be reaped from the overthrow of their rivals.\\n\\nThe result of this union of forces was a great increase in the number of\\nliterary-political clubs. In its half-aristocratic, half-democratic\\nconstitution the club was the natural product of enlarged political\\nfreedom, and helped to extend the organisation of polite opinion beyond\\nthe narrow orbit of Court society. Addison himself, in his simple style,\\npoints out the nature of the fundamental principle of Association which he\\nobserved in operation all around him. \"When a set of men find themselves\\nagree in any particular, though never so trivial, they establish\\nthemselves into a kind of fraternity, and meet once or twice a week upon\\nthe account of such a fantastic resemblance.\"[18] Among these societies,\\nin the first years of the eighteenth century, the most celebrated was,\\nperhaps, the Kit-Kat Club. It consisted of thirty-nine of the leading men\\nof the Whig party; and, though many of these were of the highest rank, it\\nis a characteristic fact that the founder of the club should have been the\\nbookseller Jacob Tonson. It was probably through his influence, joined to\\nthat of Halifax, that Addison was elected a member of the society soon\\nafter his return to England. Among its prominent members was the Duke of\\nSomerset, the first meeting between whom and Addison, after the\\ncorrespondence that had passed between them, must have been somewhat\\nembarrassing. The club assembled at one Christopher Catt\\'s, a pastry-cook,\\nwho gave his name both to the society and the mutton-pies which were its\\nordinary entertainment. Each member was compelled to select a lady as his\\ntoast, and the verses which he composed in her honour were engraved on the\\nwine-glasses belonging to the club. Addison chose the Countess of\\nManchester, whose acquaintance he had made in Paris, and complimented her\\nin the following lines:\\n\\n  \"While haughty Gallia\\'s dames, that spread\\n  O\\'er their pale cheeks an artful red,\\n  Beheld this beauteous stranger there,\\n  In native charms divinely fair,\\n  Confusion in their looks they showed,\\n  And with unborrowed blushes glowed.\"\\n\\nCircumstances seemed now to be conspiring in favour of the Whigs. The\\nTories, whose strength lay mainly in the Jacobite element, were jealous of\\nMarlborough\\'s ascendency over the Queen; on the other hand, the Duchess of\\nMarlborough, who was rapidly acquiring the chief place in Anne\\'s\\naffections, intrigued in favour of the opposite faction. In spite, too, of\\nher Tory predilections, the Queen, finding her throne menaced by the\\nambition of Louis XIV., was compelled in self-defence to look for support\\nto the party which had most vigorously identified itself with the\\nprinciples of the Revolution. She bestowed her unreserved confidence on\\nMarlborough, and he, in order to counterbalance the influence of the\\nJacobites, threw himself into the arms of the Whigs. Being named\\nCaptain-General in 1704, he undertook the campaign which he brought to so\\nglorious a conclusion on the 2d of August in that year at the battle of\\nBlenheim.\\n\\nGodolphin, who, in the absence of Marlborough, occupied the chief place in\\nthe Ministry, moved perhaps by patriotic feeling, and no doubt also by a\\nsense of the advantage which his party would derive from this great\\nvictory, was anxious that it should be commemorated in adequate verse. He\\naccordingly applied to Halifax as the person to whom the _sacer vates_\\nrequired for the occasion would probably be known. Halifax has had the\\nmisfortune to have his character transmitted to posterity by two poets who\\nhated him either on public or private grounds. Swift describes him as the\\nwould-be \"Mæcenas of the nation,\" but insinuates that he neglected the\\nwants of the poets whom he patronised:\\n\\n  \"Himself as rich as fifty Jews,\\n  Was easy though they wanted shoes.\"\\n\\nPope also satirises the vanity and meanness of his disposition in the\\nwell-known character of Bufo. Such portraits, though they are justified to\\nsome extent by evidence coming from other quarters, are not to be too\\nstrictly examined as if they bore the stamp of historic truth. It is, at\\nany rate, certain that Halifax always proved himself a warm and zealous\\nfriend to Addison, and when Godolphin applied to him for a poet to\\ncelebrate Blenheim, he answered that, though acquainted with a person who\\npossessed every qualification for the task, he could not ask him to\\nundertake it. Being pressed for his reasons, he replied \"that while too\\nmany fools and blockheads were maintained in their pride and luxury at the\\npublic expense, such men as were really an honour to their age and country\\nwere shamefully suffered to languish in obscurity; that, for his own\\nshare, he would never desire any gentleman of parts and learning to employ\\nhis time in celebrating a Ministry who had neither the justice nor the\\ngenerosity to make it worth his while.\" In answer to this the Lord\\nTreasurer assured Halifax that any person whom he might name as equal to\\nthe required task, should have no cause to repent of having rendered his\\nassistance; whereupon Halifax mentioned Addison, but stipulated that all\\nadvances to the latter must come from Godolphin himself. Accordingly,\\nBoyle, Chancellor of the Exchequer, afterwards Lord Carleton, was\\ndespatched on the embassy, and, if Pope is to be trusted, found Addison\\nlodged up three pair of stairs over a small shop. He opened to him the\\nsubject, and informed him that, in return for the service that was\\nexpected of him, he was instructed to offer him a Commissionership of\\nAppeal in the Excise, as a pledge of more considerable advancement in the\\nfuture. The fruits of this negotiation were _The Campaign_.\\n\\nWarton disposes of the merits of _The Campaign_ with the cavalier\\ncriticism, so often since repeated, that it is merely \"a gazette in\\nrhyme.\" In one sense the judgment is no doubt just. As a poem, _The\\nCampaign_ shows neither loftiness of invention nor enthusiasm of personal\\nfeeling, and it cannot therefore be ranked with such an ode as Horace\\'s\\n_Qualem ministrum_, or with Pope\\'s very fine _Epistle_ to the Earl of\\nOxford after his disgrace. Its methodical narrative style is scarcely\\nmisrepresented by Warton\\'s sarcastic description of it; but it should be\\nremembered that this style was adopted by Addison with deliberate\\nintention. \"Thus,\" says he, in the conclusion of the poem,\\n\\n  \"Thus would I fain Britannia\\'s wars rehearse\\n  In the smooth records of a faithful verse;\\n  That, if such numbers can o\\'er time prevail,\\n  May tell posterity the wondrous tale.\\n  When actions unadorned are faint and weak\\n  Cities and countries must be taught to speak;\\n  Gods may descend in factions from the skies,\\n  And rivers from their oozy beds arise;\\n  Fiction may deck the truth with spurious rays,\\n  And round the hero cast a borrowed blaze.\\n  Marlbro\\'s exploits appear divinely bright,\\n  And proudly shine in their own native light;\\n  Raised in themselves their genuine charms they boast,\\n  And those that paint them truest praise them most.\"\\n\\nThe design here avowed is certainly not poetical, but it is eminently\\nbusiness-like and extremely well adapted to the end in view. What\\nGodolphin wanted was a set of complimentary verses on Marlborough.\\nAddison, with infinite tact, declares that the highest compliment that can\\nbe paid to the hero is to recite his actions in their unadorned grandeur.\\nThis happy turn of flattery shows how far he had advanced in literary\\nskill since he wrote his address _To the King_. He had then excused\\nhimself for the inadequate celebration of William\\'s deeds on the plea\\nthat, great though these might be, they were too near the poet\\'s own time\\nto be seen in proper focus. A thousand years hence, he suggests, some\\nHomer may be inspired by the theme, \"and Boyne be sung when it has ceased\\nto flow.\" This could not have been very consolatory to a mortal craving\\nfor contemporary applause, and the apology offered in _The Campaign_ for\\nthe prosaic treatment of the subject is far more dexterous. Bearing in\\nmind the fact that it was written to order, and that the poet deliberately\\ndeclined to avail himself of the aid of fiction, we must allow that the\\nconstruction of the poem exhibits both art and dignity. The allusion to\\nthe vast slaughter at Blenheim, in the opening paragraph--\\n\\n  \"Rivers of blood I see and hills of slain,\\n  An Iliad rising out of one campaign\"--\\n\\nis not very fortunate; but the lines describing the ambition of Louis XIV.\\nare weighty and dignified, and the couplet indicating, through the single\\nimage of the Danube, the vast extent of the French encroachments, shows\\nhow thoroughly Addison was imbued with the spirit of classical poetry:\\n\\n  \"The rising Danube its long race began,\\n  And half its course through the new conquests ran.\"\\n\\nWith equal felicity he describes the position and intervention of England,\\nseizing at the same time the opportunity for a panegyric on her free\\ninstitutions:\\n\\n  \"Thrice happy Britain, from the kingdoms rent\\n  To sit the guardian of the Continent!\\n  That sees her bravest sons advanced so high\\n  And flourishing so near her prince\\'s eye;\\n  Thy favourites grow not up by fortune\\'s sport,\\n  Or from the crimes and follies of a court:\\n  On the firm basis of desert they rise,\\n  From long-tried faith and friendship\\'s holy ties,\\n  Their sovereign\\'s well-distinguished smiles they share,\\n  Her ornaments in peace, her strength in war;\\n  The nation thanks them with a public voice,\\n  By showers of blessings Heaven approves their choice;\\n  Envy itself is dumb, in wonder lost,\\n  And factions strive who shall applaud them most.\"\\n\\nHe proceeds in a stream of calm and equal verse, enlivened by dexterous\\nallusions and occasional happy turns of expression, to describe the\\nscenery of the Moselle; the march between the Maese and the Danube; the\\nheat to which the army was exposed; the arrival on the Neckar; and the\\ntrack of devastation left by the French armies. The meeting between\\nMarlborough and Eugene inspires him again to raise his style:\\n\\n  \"Great souls by instinct to each other turn,\\n  Demand alliance, and in friendship burn,\\n  A sudden friendship, while with outstretched rays\\n  They meet each other mingling blaze with blaze.\\n  Polished in courts, and hardened in the field,\\n  Renowned for conquest, and in council skilled,\\n  Their courage dwells not in a troubled flood\\n  Of mounting spirits and fermenting blood;\\n  Lodged in the soul, with virtue overruled,\\n  Inflamed by reason, and by reason cooled,\\n  In hours of peace content to be unknown,\\n  And only in the field of battle shown:\\n  To souls like these in mutual friendship joined\\n  Heaven dares entrust the cause of human kind.\"\\n\\nThe celebrated passage describing Marlborough\\'s conduct at Blenheim is\\ncertainly the finest in the poem:\\n\\n  \"\\'Twas then great Marlborough\\'s mighty soul was proved\\n  That in the shock of charging hosts unmoved,\\n  Amidst confusion, horror, and despair,\\n  Examined all the dreadful scenes of war;\\n  In peaceful thought the field of death surveyed,\\n  To fainting squadrons sent the timely aid,\\n  Inspired repulsed battalions to engage,\\n  And taught the doubtful battle where to rage.\\n  So when an angel by divine command\\n  With rising tempests shakes a guilty land,\\n  Such as of late o\\'er pale Britannia past,\\n  Calm and serene he drives the furious blast;\\n  And pleased th\\' Almighty\\'s orders to perform,\\n  Rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm.\"\\n\\nJohnson makes some characteristic criticisms on this simile, which indeed,\\nhe maintains, is not a simile, but \"an exemplification.\" He says:\\n\"Marlborough is so like the angel in the poem that the action of both is\\nalmost the same, and performed by both in the same manner. Marlborough\\n\\'teaches the battle to rage;\\' the angel \\'directs the storm;\\' Marlborough\\nis \\'unmoved in peaceful thought;\\' the angel is \\'calm and serene;\\'\\nMarlborough stands \\'unmoved amid the shock of hosts;\\' the angel rides\\n\\'calm in the whirlwind.\\' The lines on Marlborough are just and noble; but\\nthe simile gives almost the same images a second time.\"\\n\\nThis judgment would be unimpeachable if the force of the simile lay solely\\nin the likeness between Marlborough and the angel, but it is evident that\\nequal stress is to be laid on the resemblance between the battle and the\\nstorm. It was Addison\\'s intention to raise in the mind of the reader the\\nnoblest possible idea of composure and design in the midst of confusion:\\nto do this he selected an angel as the minister of the divine purpose, and\\na storm as the symbol of fury and devastation; and, in order to heighten\\nhis effect, he recalls with true art the violence of the particular\\ntempest which had recently ravaged the country. Johnson has noticed the\\nclose similarity between the persons of Marlborough and the angel; but he\\nhas exaggerated the resemblance between the actions in which they are\\nseverally engaged.\\n\\n_The Campaign_ completely fulfilled the purpose for which it was written.\\nIt strengthened the position of the Whig Ministry, and secured for its\\nauthor the advancement that had been promised him. Early in 1706 Addison,\\non the recommendation of Lord Godolphin, was promoted from the\\nCommissionership of Appeals in Excise to be Under-Secretary of State to\\nSir Charles Hedges. The latter was one of the few Tories who had retained\\ntheir position in the Ministry since the restoration of the Whigs to the\\nfavour of their sovereign, and he, too, shortly vanished from the stage\\nlike his more distinguished friends, making way for the Earl of\\nSunderland, a staunch Whig, and son-in-law to the Duke of Marlborough.\\n\\nAddison\\'s duties as Under-Secretary were probably not particularly\\narduous. In 1705 he was permitted to attend Lord Halifax to the Court of\\nHanover, whither the latter was sent to carry the Act for the\\nNaturalisation of the Electress Sophia. The mission also included\\nVanbrugh, who, as Clarencieux King-at-Arms, was charged to invest the\\nElector with the Order of the Garter; the party thus constituted affording\\na remarkable illustration of the influence exercised by literature over\\nthe politics of the period. Addison must have obtained during this journey\\nconsiderable insight into the nature of England\\'s foreign policy, as,\\nbesides establishing the closest relations with Hanover, Halifax was also\\ninstructed to form an alliance with the United Provinces for securing the\\nsuccession of the House of Brunswick to the English throne.\\n\\nIn the meantime his imagination was not idle. After helping Steele in the\\ncomposition of his _Tender Husband_, which was acted in 1705, he found\\ntime for engaging in a fresh literary enterprise of his own. The\\nprinciples of operatic music, which had long been developed in Italy, had\\nbeen slow in making their way to this country. Their introduction had been\\ndelayed partly by the French prejudices of Charles II., but more, perhaps,\\nby the strong insular tastes of the people, and by the vigorous forms of\\nthe native drama. What the untutored English audience liked best to hear\\nwas a well-marked tune, sung in a fine natural way: the kind of music\\nwhich was in vogue on the stage till the end of the seventeenth century\\nwas simply the regular drama interspersed with airs; _recitative_ was\\nunknown; and there was no attempt to cultivate the voice according to the\\nmethods practised in the Italian schools. But with the increase of wealth\\nand travel more exacting tastes began to prevail; Italian singers appeared\\non the stage and exhibited to the audience capacities of voice of which\\nthey had hitherto had no experience. In 1705 was acted at the Haymarket\\n_Arsinoe_, the first opera constructed in England on avowedly Italian\\nprinciples. The words were still in English, but the dialogue was\\nthroughout in _recitative_. The composer was Thomas Clayton, who, though a\\nman entirely devoid of genius, had travelled in Italy, and was eager to\\nturn to account the experience which he had acquired. In spite of its\\nbadness _Arsinoe_ greatly impressed the public taste; and it was soon\\nfollowed by _Camilla_, a version of an opera by Bononcini, portions of\\nwhich were sung in Italian, and portions in English--an absurdity on which\\nAddison justly comments in a number of the _Spectator_. His remarks on the\\nconsequences of translating the Italian operas are equally humorous and\\njust.\\n\\n    \"As there was no great danger,\" says he, \"of hurting the sense of\\n    these extraordinary pieces, our authors would often make words of\\n    their own which were entirely foreign to the meaning of the passages\\n    they pretended to translate; their chief care being to make the\\n    numbers of the English verse answer to those of the Italian, that both\\n    of them might go to the same tune. Thus the famous song in _Camilla_,\\n\\n        \\'Barbara si t\\'intendo,\\' etc.\\n        \\'Barbarous woman, yes, I know your meaning,\\'\\n\\n    which expresses the resentment of an angry lover, was translated into\\n    that English lamentation,\\n\\n        \\'Frail are a lover\\'s hopes,\\' etc.\\n\\n    And it was pleasant enough to see the most refined persons of the\\n    British nation dying away and languishing to notes that were filled\\n    with the spirit of rage and indignation. It happened also very\\n    frequently where the sense was rightly translated; the necessary\\n    transposition of words, which were drawn out of the phrase of one\\n    tongue into that of another, made the music appear very absurd in one\\n    tongue that was very natural in the other. I remember an Italian verse\\n    that ran thus, word for word:\\n\\n        \\'And turned my rage into pity,\\'\\n\\n    which the English, for rhyme\\'s sake, translated,\\n\\n        \\'And into pity turned my rage.\\'\\n\\n    By this means the soft notes that were adapted to pity in the Italian\\n    fell upon the word \\'rage\\' in the English; and the angry sounds that\\n    were turned to rage in the original were made to express pity in the\\n    translation. It oftentimes happened likewise that the finest notes in\\n    the air fell upon the most insignificant word in the sentence. I have\\n    known the word \\'and\\' pursued through the whole gamut; have been\\n    entertained with many a melodious \\'the;\\' and have heard the most\\n    beautiful graces, quavers, and divisions bestowed upon \\'then,\\' \\'for,\\'\\n    and \\'from,\\' to the eternal honour of our English particles.\"[19]\\n\\nPerceiving these radical defects, Addison seems to have been ambitious of\\nshowing by example how they might be remedied. \"The great success this\\nopera (_Arsinoe_) met with produced,\" says he, \"some attempts of forming\\npieces upon Italian plans, which should give a more natural and reasonable\\nentertainment than what can be met with in the elaborate trifles of that\\nnation. This alarmed the poetasters and fiddlers of the town, who were\\nused to deal in a more ordinary kind of ware, and therefore laid down an\\nestablished rule, which is received as such to this day, \\'That nothing is\\ncapable of being well set to music that is not nonsense.\\'\"[20] The\\nallusion to the failure of the writer\\'s own opera of _Rosamond_ is\\nunmistakable. The piece was performed on the 2d of April, 1706, but was\\ncoldly received, and after two or three representations was withdrawn.\\n\\nThe reasons which the _Spectator_ assigns for the catastrophe betray\\nrather the self-love of the author than the clear perception of the\\ncritic. _Rosamond_ failed because, in the first place, it was very bad as\\na musical composition. Misled by the favour with which _Arsinoe_ was\\nreceived, Addison seems to have regarded Clayton as a great musician, and\\nhe put his poem into the hands of the latter, thinking that his score\\nwould be as superior to that of _Arsinoe_ as his own poetry was to the\\nwords of that opera. Clayton, however, had no genius, and only succeeded\\nin producing what Sir John Hawkins, quoting with approbation the words of\\nanother critic, calls \"a confused chaos of music, the only merit of which\\nis its shortness.\"[21]\\n\\nBut it may be doubted whether in any case the most skilful composer could\\nhave produced music of a high order adapted to the poetry of _Rosamond_.\\nThe play is neither a tragedy, a comedy, nor a melodrama. It seems that\\nEleanor did not really poison Fair Rosamond, but only administered to her\\na sleeping potion, and, as she takes care to explain to the King,\\n\\n  \"The bowl with drowsy juices filled,\\n  From cold Egyptian drugs distilled,\\n  In borrowed death has closed her eyes.\"\\n\\nThis information proves highly satisfactory to the King, not only because\\nhe is gratified to find that Rosamond is not dead, but also because, even\\nbefore discovering her supposed dead body, he had resolved, in consequence\\nof a dream sent to him by his guardian angel, to terminate the relations\\nexisting between them. The Queen and he accordingly arrange, in a\\nbusiness-like manner, that Rosamond shall be quietly removed in her trance\\nto a nunnery; a reconciliation is then effected between the husband and\\nwife, who, as we are led to suppose, live happily ever after.\\n\\nThe main motive of the opera in Addison\\'s mind appears to have been the\\ndesire of complimenting the Marlborough family. It is dedicated to the\\nDuchess; the warlike character of Henry naturally recalls the prowess of\\nthe great modern captain; and the King is consoled by his guardian angel\\nfor the loss of Fair Rosamond with a vision of the future glories of\\nBlenheim:\\n\\n  \"To calm thy grief and lull thy cares,\\n      Look up and see\\n  What, after long revolving years,\\n      Thy bower shall be!\\n  When time its beauties shall deface,\\n  And only with its ruins grace\\n  The future prospect of the place!\\n  Behold the glorious pile ascending,\\n  Columns swelling, arches bending,\\n  Domes in awful pomp arising,\\n  Art in curious strokes surprising,\\n  Foes in figured fights contending,\\n  Behold the glorious pile ascending.\"\\n\\nThis is graceful enough, but it scarcely offers material for music of a\\nserious kind. Nor can the Court have been greatly impressed by the\\ncompliment paid to its morality, as contrasted with that of Charles II.,\\nconveyed as it was by the mouth of Grideline, one of the comic characters\\nin the piece--\\n\\n      \"Since conjugal passion\\n      Is come into fashion,\\n  And marriage so blest on the throne is,\\n      Like a Venus I\\'ll shine,\\n      Be fond and be fine,\\n  And Sir Trusty shall be my Adonis.\"\\n\\nThe ill success of _Rosamond_ confirmed Addison\\'s dislike to the Italian\\nopera, which he displayed both in his grave and humorous papers on the\\nsubject in the _Spectator_. The disquisition upon the various actors of\\nthe lion in _Hydaspes_ is one of his happiest inspirations; but his\\nserious criticisms are, as a rule, only just in so far as they are\\ndirected against the dramatic absurdities of the Italian opera. As to his\\ntechnical qualifications as a critic of music, it will be sufficient to\\ncite the opinion of Dr. Burney: \"To judges of music nothing more need be\\nsaid of Mr. Addison\\'s abilities to decide concerning the comparative\\ndegrees of national excellence in the art, and the merit of particular\\nmasters, than his predilection for the productions of Clayton, and\\ninsensibility to the force and originality of Handel\\'s compositions in\\n_Rinaldo_.\"[22]\\n\\nIn December, 1708, the Earl of Sunderland was displaced to make room for\\nthe Tory Lord Dartmouth, and Addison, as Under-Secretary, following the\\nfortunes of his superior, found himself again without employment.\\nFortunately for him the Earl of Wharton was almost immediately afterwards\\nmade Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and offered him the lucrative post of\\nSecretary. The Earl, who was subsequently created a Marquis, was the\\nfather of the famous Duke satirised in Pope\\'s first _Moral Essay_; he was\\nin every respect the opposite of Addison--a vehement Republican, a\\nsceptic, unprincipled in his morals, venal in his methods of Government.\\nHe was nevertheless a man of the finest talents, and seems to have\\npossessed the power of gaining personal ascendency over his companions by\\na profound knowledge of character. An acquaintance with Addison, doubtless\\ncommencing at the Kit-Kat Club, of which both were members, had convinced\\nhim that the latter had eminent qualifications for the task, which the\\nSecretary\\'s post would involve, of dealing with men of very various\\nconditions. Of the feelings with which Addison on his side regarded the\\nEarl we have no record. \"It is reasonable to suppose,\" says Johnson, \"that\\nhe counteracted, as far as he was able, the malignant and blasting\\ninfluence of the Lieutenant; and that, at least, by his intervention some\\ngood was done and some mischief prevented.\" Not a shadow of an imputation,\\nat any rate, rests upon his own conduct as Secretary. He appears to have\\nacted strictly on that conception of public duty which he defines in one\\nof his papers in the _Spectator_. Speaking of the marks of a corrupt\\nofficial, \"Such an one,\" he declares, \"is the man who, upon any pretence\\nwhatsoever, receives more than what is the stated and unquestioned fee of\\nhis office. Gratifications, tokens of thankfulness, despatch money, and\\nthe like specious terms, are the pretences under which corruption very\\nfrequently shelters itself. An honest man will, however, look on all these\\nmethods as unjustifiable, and will enjoy himself better in a moderate\\nfortune, that is gained with honour and reputation, than in an overgrown\\nestate that is cankered with the acquisitions of rapine and exaction. Were\\nall our offices discharged with such an inflexible integrity, we should\\nnot see men in all ages, who grow up to exorbitant wealth, with the\\nabilities which are to be met with in an ordinary mechanic.\"[23] His\\nfriends perhaps considered that his impartiality was somewhat\\noverstrained, since he always declined to remit the customary fees in\\ntheir favour. \"For,\" said he, \"I may have forty friends, whose fees may be\\ntwo guineas a-piece; then I lose eighty guineas, and my friends gain but\\ntwo a-piece.\"\\n\\nHe took with him as his own Secretary, Eustace Budgell, who was related to\\nhim, and for whom he seems to have felt a warm affection. Budgell was a\\nman of considerable literary ability, and was the writer of the various\\npapers in the _Spectator_ signed \"X,\" some of which succeed happily in\\nimitating Addison\\'s style. While he was under his friend\\'s guidance his\\ncareer was fairly successful, but his temper was violent, and when, at a\\nlater period of his life, he served in Ireland under a new Lieutenant and\\nanother Secretary, he became involved in disputes which led to his\\ndismissal. A furious pamphlet against the Lord-Lieutenant, the Duke of\\nBolton, published by him in spite of Addison\\'s remonstrances, only\\ncomplicated his position, and from this period his fortunes steadily\\ndeclined. He lost largely in the South Sea Scheme; spent considerable sums\\nin a vain endeavour to obtain a seat in Parliament; and at last came under\\nthe influence of his kinsman, Tindal, the well-known deist, whose will he\\nis accused of having falsified. With his usual infelicity he happened to\\nrouse the resentment of Pope, and was treated in consequence to one of\\nthe deadly couplets with which that great poet was in the habit of\\nrepaying real or supposed injuries:\\n\\n  \"Let Budgell charge low Grub Street on his quill,\\n  And write whate\\'er he pleased--except his will.\"\\n\\nThe lines were memorable, and were doubtless often quoted, and the\\nwretched man finding his life insupportable, ended it by drowning himself\\nin the Thames.\\n\\nDuring his residence in Ireland Addison firmly cemented his friendship\\nwith Swift, whose acquaintance he had probably made after _The Campaign_\\nhad given him a leading position in the Whig party, on the side of which\\nthe sympathies of both were then enlisted. Swift\\'s admiration for Addison\\nwas warm and generous. When the latter was on the point of embarking on\\nhis new duties, Swift wrote to a common friend, Colonel Hunter, \"Mr.\\nAddison is hurrying away for Ireland, and I pray too much business may not\\nspoil _le plus honnete homme du monde_.\" To Archbishop King he wrote: \"Mr.\\nAddison, who goes over our first secretary, is a most excellent person,\\nand being my intimate friend I shall use all my credit to set him right in\\nhis notions of persons and things.\" Addison\\'s duties took him occasionally\\nto England, and during one of his visits Swift writes to him from Ireland:\\n\"I am convinced that whatever Government come over you will find all marks\\nof kindness from any parliament here with respect to your employment, the\\nTories contending with the Whigs which should speak best of you. In short,\\nif you will come over again when you are at leisure we will raise an army\\nand make you King of Ireland. Can you think so meanly of a kingdom as not\\nto be pleased that every creature in it, who hath one grain of worth, has\\na veneration for you?\" In his _Journal to Stella_ he says, under date of\\nOctober 12, 1710: \"Mr. Addison\\'s election has passed easy and undisputed;\\nand I believe if he had a mind to be chosen king he would hardly be\\nrefused.\" On his side Addison\\'s feelings were equally warm. He presented\\nSwift with a copy of his _Remarks on Several Parts of Italy_, inscribing\\nit--\"To the most agreeable companion, the truest friend, and the greatest\\ngenius of his age.\"\\n\\nThis friendship, founded on mutual respect, was destined to be impaired by\\npolitical differences. In 1710 the credit of the Whig Ministry had been\\ngreatly undermined by the combined craft of Harley and Mrs. Masham, and\\nSwift, who was anxious as to his position, on coming over to England to\\npress his claims on Somers and Halifax, found that they were unable to\\nhelp him. He appears to have considered that their want of power proceeded\\nfrom want of will; at any rate, he made advances to Harley, which were of\\ncourse gladly received. The Ministry were at this time being hard pressed\\nby the _Examiner_, under the conduct of Prior, and at their instance\\nAddison started the _Whig Examiner_ in their defence. Though this paper\\nwas written effectively and with admirable temper, party polemics were\\nlittle to the taste of its author, and, after five numbers, it ceased to\\nexist on the 8th of October. Swift, now eager for the triumph of the\\nTories, expresses his delight to Stella by informing her, in the words of\\na Tory song, that \"it was down among the dead men.\" He himself wrote the\\nfirst of his _Examiners_ on the 2d of the following November, and the\\ncrushing blows with which he followed it up did much to hasten the\\ndownfall of the Ministry. As was natural, Addison was somewhat displeased\\nat his friend\\'s defection. In December Swift writes to Stella, \"Mr.\\nAddison and I are as different as black and white, and I believe our\\nfriendship will go off by this d---- business of party. He cannot bear\\nseeing me fall in so with the Ministry; but I love him still as much as\\never, though we seldom meet.\" In January, 1710-11, he says: \"I called at\\nthe coffee-house, where I had not been in a week, and talked coldly awhile\\nwith Mr. Addison; all our friendship and dearness are off; we are civil\\nacquaintance, talk words, of course, of when we shall meet, and that\\'s\\nall. Is it not odd?\" Many similar entries follow; but on June 26, 1711,\\nthe record is: \"Mr. Addison and I talked as usual, and as if we had seen\\none another yesterday.\" And on September 14, he observes: \"This evening I\\nmet Addison and pastoral Philips in the Park, and supped with them in\\nAddison\\'s lodgings. We were very good company, and I yet know no man half\\nso agreeable to me as he is. I sat with them till twelve.\"\\n\\nIt was perhaps through the influence of Swift, who spoke warmly with the\\nTory Ministry on behalf of Addison, that the latter, on the downfall of\\nthe Whigs in the autumn of 1710, was for some time suffered to retain the\\nKeepership of the Records in Bermingham\\'s Tower, an Irish place which had\\nbeen bestowed upon him by the Queen as a special mark of the esteem with\\nwhich she regarded him, and which appears to have been worth £400 a\\nyear.[24] In other respects his fortunes were greatly altered by the\\nchange of Ministry. \"I have within this twelvemonth,\" he writes to Wortley\\non the 21st of July, 1711, \"lost a place of £2000 per ann., an estate in\\nthe Indies worth £14,000, and, what is worse than all the rest, my\\nmistress.[25] Hear this and wonder at my philosophy! I find they are going\\nto take away my Irish place from me too; to which I must add that I have\\njust resigned my fellowship, and that stocks sink every day.\" In spite of\\nthese losses his circumstances were materially different from those in\\nwhich he found himself after the fall of the previous Whig Ministry in\\n1702. Before the close of the year 1711 he was able to buy the estate of\\nBilton, near Rugby, for £10,000. Part of the purchase money was probably\\nprovided from what he had saved while he was Irish Secretary, and had\\ninvested in the funds; and part was, no doubt, made up from the profits of\\nthe _Tatler_ and the _Spectator_. Miss Aikin says that a portion was\\nadvanced by his brother Gulston; but this seems to be an error. Two years\\nbefore, the Governor of Fort St. George had died, leaving him his executor\\nand residuary legatee. This is no doubt \"the estate in the Indies\" to\\nwhich he refers in his letter to Wortley, but he had as yet derived no\\nbenefit from it. His brother had left his affairs in great confusion; the\\ntrustees were careless or dishonest; and though about £600 was remitted to\\nhim in the shape of diamonds in 1713, the liquidation was not complete\\ntill 1716, when only a small moiety of the sum bequeathed to him came into\\nhis hands.[26]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\nTHE _TATLER_ AND _SPECTATOR_.\\n\\n\\nThe career of Addison, as described in the preceding chapters, has\\nexemplified the great change effected in the position of men of letters in\\nEngland by the Restoration and the Revolution; it is now time to exhibit\\nhim in his most characteristic light, and to show the remarkable service\\nthe eighteenth century essayists performed for English society in creating\\nan organised public opinion. It is difficult for ourselves, who look on\\nthe action of the periodical press as part of the regular machinery of\\nlife, to appreciate the magnitude of the task accomplished by Addison and\\nSteele in the pages of the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_. Every day, week,\\nmonth, and quarter now sees the issue of a vast number of journals and\\nmagazines intended to form the opinion of every order and section of\\nsociety; but in the reign of Queen Anne the only centres of society that\\nexisted were the Court, with the aristocracy that revolved about it, and\\nthe clubs and coffee-houses, in which the commercial and professional\\nclasses met to discuss matters of general interest. The _Tatler_ and\\n_Spectator_ were the first organs in which an attempt was made to give\\nform and consistency to the opinion arising out of this social contact.\\nBut we should form a very erroneous idea of the character of these\\npublications if we regarded them as the sudden productions of individual\\ngenius, written in satisfaction of a mere temporary taste. Like all\\nmasterpieces in art and literature, they mark the final stage of a long\\nand painful journey, and the merit of their inventors consists largely in\\nthe judgment with which they profited by the experience of many\\npredecessors.\\n\\nThe first newspaper published in Europe was the _Gazzetta_ of Venice,\\nwhich was written in manuscript, and read aloud at certain places in the\\ncity, to supply information to the people during the war with the Turks in\\n1536. In England it was not till the reign of Elizabeth that the increased\\nfacilities of communication and the growth of wealth caused the purveyance\\nof news to become a profitable employment. Towards the end of the\\nsixteenth century newsmongers began to issue little pamphlets reporting\\nextraordinary intelligence, but not issued at regular periods. The titles\\nof these publications, which are all of them that survive, show that the\\narts with which the framers of the placards of our own newspapers\\nendeavour to attract attention are of venerable antiquity: \"Wonderful and\\nStrange newes out of Suffolke and Essex, where it rained wheat the space\\nof six or seven miles\" (1583); \"Lamentable newes out of Monmouthshire,\\ncontaininge the wonderfull and fearfull accounts of the great overflowing\\nof the waters in the said countrye\" (1607).[27]\\n\\nIn 1622 one Nathaniel Butter began to publish a newspaper bearing a fixed\\ntitle and appearing at stated intervals. It was called the _Weekly Newes\\nfrom Italy and Germanie, etc._, and was said to be printed for _Mercurius\\nBritannicus_. This novelty provided much food for merriment to the poets,\\nand Ben Jonson in his _Staple of News_ satirises Butter, under the name\\nof Nathaniel, in a passage which the curious reader will do well to\\nconsult, as it shows the low estimation in which newspapers were then\\nheld.[28]\\n\\nThough it might appear from Jonson\\'s dialogue that the newspapers of that\\nday contained many items of domestic intelligence, such was scarcely the\\ncase. Butter and his contemporaries, as was natural to men who confined\\nthemselves to the publication of news without attempting to form opinion,\\nobtained their materials almost entirely from abroad, whereby they at once\\naroused more vividly the imagination of their readers, and doubtless gave\\nmore scope to their own invention. Besides, they were not at liberty to\\nretail home news of that political kind which would have been of the\\ngreatest interest to the public. For a long time the evanescent character\\nof the newspaper allowed it to escape the attention of the licenser, but\\nthe growing demand for this sort of reading at last brought it under\\nsupervision, and so strict was the control exercised over even the reports\\nof foreign intelligence that its weekly appearance was frequently\\ninterrupted.\\n\\nIn 1641, however, the Star-chamber was abolished, and the heated political\\natmosphere of the times generated a new species of journal, in which we\\nfind the first attempt to influence opinion through the periodical press.\\nThis was the newspaper known under the generic title of _Mercury_. Many\\nweekly publications of this name appeared during the Civil Wars on the\\nside of both King and Parliament, _Mercurius Anlicus_ being the\\nrepresentative organ of the Royalist cause, and _Mercurius Pragmaticus_\\nand _Mercurius Politicus_ of the Republicans. Party animosities were thus\\nkept alive, and proved so inconvenient to the Government that the\\nParliament interfered to curtail the liberty of the press. In 1647 an\\nordinance passed the House of Lords, prohibiting any person from \"making,\\nwriting, printing, selling, publishing, or uttering, or causing to be\\nmade, any book, sheet, or sheets of news whatsoever, except the same be\\nlicensed by both or either House of Parliament, with the name of the\\nauthor, printer, and licenser affixed.\" In spite of this prohibition,\\nwhich was renewed by Act of Parliament in 1662, many unlicensed\\nperiodicals continued to appear, till in 1663 the Government, finding\\ntheir repressive measures insufficient, resolved to grapple with the\\ndifficulty by monopolising the right to publish news.\\n\\nThe author of this new project was the well-known Roger L\\'Estrange, who in\\n1663 obtained a patent assigning to him \"all the sole privilege of\\nwriting, printing, and publishing all Narratives, Advertisements,\\nMercuries, Intelligencers, Diurnals, and other books of public\\nintelligence.\" L\\'Estrange\\'s journal was called the _Public Intelligencer_;\\nit was published once a week, and in its form was a rude anticipation of\\nthe modern newspaper, containing as it did an obituary, reports of the\\nproceedings in Parliament and in the Court of Claims, a list of the\\ncircuits of the judges, of sheriffs, Lent preachers, etc. After being\\ncontinued for two years it gave place first, in 1665, to the _Oxford\\nGazette_, published at Oxford, whither the Court had retired during the\\nplague; and in 1666 to the _London Gazette_, which was under the immediate\\ncontrol of an Under-Secretary of State. The office of Gazetteer became\\nhenceforth a regular ministerial appointment, and was viewed with\\ndifferent eyes according as men were affected towards the Government.\\nSteele, who held it, says of it: \"My next appearance as a writer was in\\nthe quality of the lowest Minister of State--to wit, in the office of\\nGazetteer; where I worked faithfully according to order, without ever\\nerring against the rule observed by all Ministers, to keep that paper very\\ninnocent and very insipid.\" Pope, on the other hand, who regarded it as an\\norgan published to influence opinion in favour of the Government, is\\nconstant in his attacks upon it, and has immortalised it in the memorable\\nlines in the _Dunciad_ beginning, \"Next plunged a feeble but a desperate\\npack,\" etc.\\n\\nIn 1679 the Licensing Act passed in 1662 expired, and the Parliament\\ndeclined to renew it. The Court was thus left without protection against\\nthe expression of public opinion, which was daily becoming more bold and\\noutspoken. In his extremity the King fell back on the servility of the\\njudges, and, having procured from them an opinion that the publishing of\\nany printed matter without license was contrary to the common law, he\\nissued his famous Proclamation (in 1680) \"to prohibit and forbid all\\npersons whatsoever to print or publish any news, book, or pamphlets of\\nnews, not licensed by his Majesty\\'s authority.\"\\n\\nDisregard of the proclamation was treated as a breach of the peace, and\\nmany persons were punished accordingly. This severity produced the effect\\nintended. The voice of the periodical press was stifled, and the _London\\nGazette_ was left almost in exclusive possession of the field of news.\\nWhen Monmouth landed in 1685 the King managed to obtain from Parliament a\\nrenewal of the Licensing Act for seven years, and even after the\\nRevolution of 1688 several attempts were made by the Ministerial Whigs to\\nprolong or to renew the operation of the Act. In spite, however, of the\\nviolence of the organs of \"Grub Street,\" which had grown up under it,\\nthese attempts were unsuccessful; it was justly felt that it was wiser to\\nleave falsehood and scurrility to be gradually corrected by public\\nopinion, as speaking through an unfettered press, than to attack them by a\\nlaw which they had proved themselves able to defy. From 1682 the freedom\\nof the press may therefore be said to date, and the lapse of the Licensing\\nAct was the signal for a remarkable outburst of journalistic enterprise\\nand invention. Not only did the newspapers devoted to the report of\\nforeign intelligence reappear in greatly increased numbers, but, whereas\\nthe old _Mercuries_ had never been published more than once in the same\\nweek, the new comers made their appearance twice and sometimes even three\\ntimes. In 1702 was printed the first daily newspaper, _The Daily Courant_.\\nIt could only at starting provide material to cover one side of a half\\nsheet of paper; but the other side was very soon covered with printed\\nmatter, in which form its existence was prolonged till 1735.\\n\\nThe development of party government of course encouraged the controversial\\ncapacities of the journalist, and many notorious, and some famous names\\nare now found among the combatants in the political arena. On the side of\\nthe Whigs the most redoubtable champions were Daniel Defoe, of the\\n_Review_, who was twice imprisoned and once set in the pillory for his\\npolitical writings; John Tutchin, of the _Observator_; and Ridpath, of the\\n_Flying Post_--all of whom have obtained places in the _Dunciad_. The old\\nTories appear to have been satisfied during the early part of Queen Anne\\'s\\nreign with prosecuting the newspapers that attacked them; but Harley, who\\nunderstood the power of the press, engaged Prior to harass the Whigs in\\nthe _Examiner_, and was afterwards dexterous enough to secure the\\ninvaluable assistance of Swift for the same paper. In opposition to the\\n_Examiner_ in its early days the Whigs, as has been said, started the\\n_Whig Examiner_, under the auspices of Addison, so that the two great\\nhistorical parties had their cases stated by the two greatest\\nprose-writers of the first half of the eighteenth century.\\n\\nBeside the Quidnunc and the party politician, another class of reader now\\nappeared demanding aliment in the press. Men of active and curious minds,\\nwith a little leisure and a large love of discussion, loungers at Will\\'s\\nor at the Grecian Coffee-Houses, were anxious to have their doubts on all\\nsubjects resolved by a printed oracle. Their tastes were gratified by the\\ningenuity of John Dunton, whose strange account of his _Life and Errors_\\nthrows a strong light on the literary history of this period. In 1690\\nDunton published his _Athenian Gazette_, the name of which he afterwards\\naltered to the _Athenian Mercury_. The object of this paper was to answer\\nquestions put to the editor by the public. These were of all kinds--on\\nreligion, casuistry, love, literature, and manners--no question being too\\nsubtle or absurd to extract a reply from the conductor of the paper. The\\n_Athenian Mercury_ seems to have been read by as many distinguished men of\\nthe period as _Notes and Queries_ in our own time, and there can be no\\ndoubt that the quaint humours it originated gave the first hint to the\\ninventors of the _Tatler_ and the _Spectator_.\\n\\nAdvertisements were inserted in the newspapers at a comparatively early\\nperiod of their existence. The editor acted as middleman between the\\nadvertiser and the public, and made his announcements in a style of easy\\nfrankness which will appear to the modern reader extremely refreshing.\\nThus, in the \"Collection for the Improvement of Husbandry and Trade\"\\n(1682), there are the following:\\n\\n    \"If I can meet with a sober man that has a counter-tenor voice, I can\\n    help him to a place worth thirty pound the year or more.\\n\\n    \"If any noble or other gentleman wants a porter that is very lusty,\\n    comely, and six foot high and two inches, I can help.\\n\\n    \"I want a complete young man that will wear a livery, to wait on a\\n    very valuable gentleman; but he must know how to play on a violin or\\n    flute.\\n\\n    \"I want a genteel footman that can play on the violin, to wait on a\\n    person of honour.\"[29]\\n\\nEverything was now prepared for the production of a class of newspaper\\ndesigned to form and direct public opinion on rational principles. The\\npress was emancipated from State control; a reading public had constituted\\nitself out of the _habitués_ of the coffee-houses and clubs; nothing was\\nwanted but an inventive genius to adapt the materials at his disposal to\\nthe circumstances of the time. The required hero was not long in making\\nhis appearance.\\n\\nRichard Steele, the son of an official under the Irish Government, was,\\nabove all things, \"a creature of ebullient heart.\" Impulse and sentiment\\nwere with him always far stronger motives of action than reason,\\nprinciple, or even interest. He left Oxford, without taking a degree, from\\nan ardent desire to serve in the army, thereby sacrificing his prospect of\\nsucceeding to a family estate; his extravagance and dissipation while\\nserving in the cavalry were notorious; yet this did not dull the clearness\\nof his moral perceptions, for it was while his excesses were at their\\nheight that he dedicated to his commanding officer, Lord Cutts, his\\n_Christian Hero_. Vehement in his political, as in all other feelings, he\\ndid not hesitate to resign the office he held under the Tory Government in\\n1711 in order to attack it for what he considered its treachery to the\\ncountry; but he was equally outspoken, and with equal disadvantage to\\nhimself, when he found himself at a later period in disagreement with the\\nWhigs. He had great fertility of invention, strong natural humour, true\\nthough uncultivated taste, and inexhaustible human sympathy.\\n\\nHis varied experience had made him well acquainted with life and\\ncharacter, and in his office of Gazetteer he had had an opportunity of\\nwatching the eccentricities of the public taste, which, now emancipated\\nfrom restraint, began vaguely to feel after new ideals. That, under such\\ncircumstances, he should have formed the design of treating current events\\nfrom a humorous point of view was only natural, but he was indebted for\\nthe form of his newspaper to the most original genius of the age. Swift\\nhad early in the eighteenth century exercised his ironical vein by\\ntreating the everyday occurrences of life in a mock-heroic style. Among\\nhis pieces of this kind that were most successful in catching the public\\ntaste were the humorous predictions of the death of Partridge, the\\nastrologer, signed with the name of Isaac Bickerstaff. Steele, seizing on\\nthe name and character of Partridge\\'s fictitious rival, turned him with\\nmuch pleasantry into the editor of a new journal, the design of which he\\nmakes Isaac describe as follows:\\n\\n    \"The state of conversation and business in this town having long been\\n    perplexed with Pretenders in both kinds, in order to open men\\'s minds\\n    against such abuses, it appeared no unprofitable undertaking to\\n    publish a Paper, which should observe upon the manners of the\\n    pleasurable, as well as the busy part of mankind. To make this\\n    generally read, it seemed the most proper method to form it by way of\\n    a Letter of Intelligence, consisting of such parts as might gratify\\n    the curiosity of persons of all conditions and of each sex.... The\\n    general purposes of this Paper is to expose the false arts of life, to\\n    pull off the disguises of cunning, vanity, and affectation, and to\\n    recommend a general simplicity in our dress, our discourse, and our\\n    behaviour.\"[30]\\n\\nThe name of the _Tatler_, Isaac informs us, was \"invented in honour of the\\nfair sex,\" for whose entertainment the new paper was largely designed. It\\nappeared three times a week, and its price was a penny, though it seems\\nthat the first number, published April 12, 1709, was distributed _gratis_\\nas an advertisement. In order to make the contents of the paper varied it\\nwas divided into five portions, of which the editor gives the following\\naccount:\\n\\n    \"All accounts of Gallantry, Pleasure, and Entertainment, shall be\\n    under the article of White\\'s Chocolate-House; Poetry under that of\\n    Will\\'s Coffee-House; Learning under the title of Grecian; Foreign and\\n    Domestic News you will have from Saint James\\' Coffee-House; and what\\n    else I have to offer on any other subject shall be dated from my own\\n    apartment.\"[31]\\n\\nIn this division we see the importance of the coffee-houses as the natural\\ncentres of intelligence and opinion. Of the four houses mentioned, St.\\nJames\\' and White\\'s, both of them in St. James\\' Street, were the chief\\nhaunts of statesmen and men of fashion, and the latter had acquired an\\ninfamous notoriety for the ruinous gambling of its _habitués_. Will\\'s, in\\nRussell Street, Covent Garden, kept up the reputation which it had\\nprocured in Dryden\\'s time as the favourite meeting-place of men of\\nletters; while the Grecian, in Devereux Court in the Strand, which was the\\noldest coffee-house in London, afforded a convenient _rendezvous_ for the\\nlearned Templars. At starting, the design announced in the first number\\nwas adhered to with tolerable fidelity. The paper dated from St. James\\'\\nCoffee-House was always devoted to the recital of foreign news; that from\\nWill\\'s either criticised the current dramas, or contained a copy of\\nverses from some author of repute, or a piece of general literary\\ncriticism; the latest gossip at White\\'s was reproduced in a fictitious\\nform and with added colour. Advertisements were also inserted; and half a\\nsheet of the paper was left blank, in order that at the last moment the\\nmost recent intelligence might be added in manuscript, after the manner of\\nthe contemporary news-letters. In all these respects the character of the\\nnewspaper was preserved; but in the method of treating news adopted by the\\neditor there was a constant tendency to subordinate matter of fact to the\\nelements of humour, fiction, and sentiment. In his survey of the manners\\nof the time, Isaac, as an astrologer, was assisted by a familiar spirit,\\nnamed Pacolet, who revealed to him the motives and secrets of men; his\\nsister, Mrs. Jenny Distaff, was occasionally deputed to produce the paper\\nfrom the wizard\\'s \"own apartment;\" and Kidney, the waiter at St. James\\'\\nCoffee-House, was humorously represented as the chief authority in all\\nmatters of foreign intelligence.\\n\\nThe mottoes assumed by the _Tatler_ at different periods of its existence\\nmark the stages of its development. On its first appearance, when Steele\\nseems to have intended it to be little more than a lively record of news,\\nthe motto placed at the head of each paper was\\n\\n  \"Quidquid agunt homines,\\n              nostri est farrago libelli.\"\\n\\nIt soon became evident, however, that its true function was not merely to\\nreport the actions of men, but to discuss the propriety of their actions;\\nand by the time that sufficient material had accumulated to constitute a\\nvolume, the essayists felt themselves justified in appropriating the words\\nused by Pliny in the preface to his _Natural History_:\\n\\n    \"Nemo apud nos qui idem tentaverit: equidem sentio peculiarem in\\n    studiis causam corum esse, qui difficultatibus victis, utilitatem\\n    juvandi, protulerunt gratiæ placendi. Res ardua vetustis novitatem\\n    dare, novis auctoritatem, obsoletis nitorem, fastidiis gratiam, dubiis\\n    fidem, omnibus vero naturam, et naturæ suæ omnia. Itaque NON ASSECUTIS\\n    _voluisse_, abunde pulchrum atque magnificum est.\"\\n\\nThe disguise of the mock astrologer proved very useful to Steele in his\\ncharacter of moralist. It enabled him to give free utterance to his better\\nfeelings, without the risk of incurring the charge of inconsistency or\\nhypocrisy, and nothing can be more honourable to him than the open manner\\nin which he acknowledges his own unfitness for the position of a moralist:\\n\"I shall not carry my humility so far,\" says he, \"as to call myself a\\nvicious man, but at the same time must confess my life is at best but\\npardonable. With no greater character than this, a man would make but an\\nindifferent progress in attacking prevailing and fashionable vices, which\\nMr. Bickerstaff has done with a freedom of spirit that would have lost\\nboth its beauty and efficacy had it been pretended to by Mr. Steele.\"[32]\\n\\nAs Steele cannot claim the sole merit of having invented the form of the\\n_Tatler_, so, too, it must be remembered that he could never have\\naddressed society in the high moral tone assumed by Bickerstaff if the\\nroad had not been prepared for him by others. One name among his\\npredecessors stands out with a special title to honourable record. Since\\nthe Restoration the chief school of manners had been the stage, and the\\nflagrant example of immorality set by the Court had been bettered by the\\ninvention of the comic dramatists of the period. Indecency was the\\nfashion; religion and sobriety were identified by the polite world with\\nPuritanism and hypocrisy. Even the Church had not yet ventured to say a\\nword in behalf of virtue against the prevailing taste, and when at last a\\nclergyman raised his voice on behalf of the principles which he professed,\\nthe blow which he dealt to his antagonists was the more damaging because\\nit was entirely unexpected. Jeremy Collier was not only a Tory but a\\nJacobite, not only a High Churchman but a Nonjuror, who had been outlawed\\nfor his fidelity to the principles of Legitimism; and that such a man\\nshould have published the _Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of\\nthe English Stage_, reflecting, as the book did, in the strongest manner\\non the manners of the fallen dynasty, was as astounding as thunder from a\\nclear sky. Collier, however, was a man of sincere piety, whose mind was\\nfor the moment occupied only by the overwhelming danger of the evil which\\nhe proposed to attack. It is true that his method of attack was cumbrous,\\nand that his conclusions were far too sweeping and often unjust;\\nnevertheless, the general truth of his criticisms was felt to be\\nirresistible. Congreve and Vanbrugh each attempted an apology for their\\nprofession; both, however, showed their perception of the weakness of\\ntheir position by correcting or recasting scenes in their comedies to\\nwhich Collier had objected. Dryden accepted the reproof in a nobler\\nspirit. Even while he had pandered to the tastes of the times, he had been\\nconscious of his treachery to the cause of true art, and had broken out in\\na fine passage in his _Ode to the Memory of Mrs. Killigrew_:\\n\\n  \"O gracious God! how far have we\\n  Profaned thy heavenly gift of poesy!\\n  Made prostitute and profligate the Muse,\\n  Debased to each obscene and impious use!\\n\\n     *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n  \"O wretched we! why were we hurried down\\n    This lubrique and adulterous age\\n  (Nay, added fat pollutions of our own)\\n    To increase the streaming ordure of the stage?\"\\n\\nWhen Collier attacked him he bent his head in submission. \"In many\\nthings,\" says he, \"he has taxed me justly, and I have pleaded guilty to\\nall thought and expressions of mine which can be truly argued of\\nobscenity, profaneness, or immorality, and retract them. If he be my\\nenemy, let him triumph; if he be my friend, as I have given him no\\npersonal occasion to be otherwise, he will be glad of my repentance.\"[33]\\n\\nThe first blow against fashionable immorality having been boldly struck,\\nwas followed up systematically. In 1690 was founded \"The Society for the\\nReformation of Manners,\" which published every year an account of the\\nprogress made in suppressing profaneness and debauchery by its means. It\\ncontinued its operations till 1738, and during its existence prosecuted,\\naccording to its own calculations, 101,683 persons. William III. showed\\nhimself prompt to encourage the movement which his subjects had begun. The\\n_London Gazette_ of 27th February, 1698-99, contains a report of the\\nfollowing remarkable order:\\n\\n    \"His Majesty being informed, That, notwithstanding an order made the\\n    4th of June, 1697, by the Earl of Sunderland, then Lord Chamberlain of\\n    His Majesty\\'s Household, to prevent the Prophaneness and Immorality of\\n    the Stage, several Plays have been lately acted containing expressions\\n    contrary to Religion and Good Manners: and whereas the Master of the\\n    Revels has represented, That, in contempt of the said order, the\\n    actors do often neglect to leave out such Prophane and Indecent\\n    expressions as he has thought proper to be omitted. These are\\n    therefore to signifie his Majesty\\'s pleasure, that you do not\\n    hereafter presume to act anything in any play contrary to Religion and\\n    Good Manners as you shall answer it at your utmost peril. Given under\\n    my Hand this 18th of February, 1698. In the eleventh year of his\\n    Majesty\\'s reign.\"\\n\\nIt is difficult to realise, in reading the terms of this order, that only\\nthirteen years had elapsed since the death of Charles II., and undoubtedly\\na very large share of the credit due for such a revolution in the public\\ntaste is to be assigned to Collier. Collier, however, did nothing in a\\nliterary or artistic sense to improve the character of English literature.\\nHis severity, uncompromising as that of the Puritans, inspired Vice with\\nterror, but could not plead with persuasion on behalf of Virtue; his\\nsweeping conclusions struck at the roots of Art as well as of Immorality.\\nHe sought to destroy the drama and kindred pleasures of the Imagination,\\nnot to reform them. What the age needed was a writer to satisfy its\\nnatural desires for healthy and rational amusement, and Steele, with his\\nstrongly-developed twofold character, was the man of all others to bridge\\nover the chasm between irreligious licentiousness and Puritanical\\nrigidity. Driven headlong on one side of his nature towards all the tastes\\nand pleasures which absorbed the Court of Charles II., his heart in the\\nmidst of his dissipation never ceased to approve of whatever was great,\\nnoble, and generous. He has described himself with much feeling in his\\ndisquisition on the _Rake_, a character which he says many men are\\ndesirous of assuming without any natural qualifications for supporting it:\\n\\n    \"A Rake,\" says he, \"is a man always to be pitied; and if he lives one\\n    day is certainly reclaimed; for his faults proceed not from choice or\\n    inclination, but from strong passions and appetites, which are in\\n    youth too violent for the curb of reason, good sense, good manners,\\n    and good nature; all which he must have by nature and education\\n    before he can be allowed to be or to have been of this order.... His\\n    desires run away with him through the strength and force of a lively\\n    imagination, which hurries him on to unlawful pleasures before reason\\n    has power to come in to his rescue.\"\\n\\nThat impulsiveness of feeling which is here described, and which was the\\ncause of so many of Steele\\'s failings in real life, made him the most\\npowerful and persuasive advocate of Virtue in fiction. Of all the\\nimaginative English essayists he is the most truly natural. His large\\nheart seems to rush out in sympathy with any tale of sorrow or exhibition\\nof magnanimity; and even in criticism, his true natural instinct, joined\\nto his constitutional enthusiasm, often raises his judgments to a level\\nwith those of Addison himself, as in his excellent essay in the\\n_Spectator_ on Raphael\\'s cartoons. Examples of these characteristics in\\nhis style are to be found in the _Story of Unnion and Valentine_,[34] and\\nin the fine paper describing two tragedies of real life;[35] in the series\\nof papers on duelling, occasioned by a duel into which he was himself\\nforced against his own inclination;[36] and in the sound advice which\\nIsaac gives to his half-sister Jenny on the morrow of her marriage.[37]\\nPerhaps, however, the chivalry and generosity of feeling which make\\nSteele\\'s writings so attractive are most apparent in the delightful paper\\ncontaining the letter of Serjeant Hall from the camp before Mons. After\\npointing out to his readers the admirable features in the serjeant\\'s\\nsimple letter, Steele concludes as follows:\\n\\n    \"If we consider the heap of an army, utterly out of all prospect of\\n    rising and preferment, as they certainly are, and such great things\\n    executed by them, it is hard to account for the motive of their\\n    gallantry. But to me, who was a cadet at the battle of Coldstream, in\\n    Scotland, when Monk charged at the head of the regiment now called\\n    Coldstream, from the victory of that day--I remember it as well as if\\n    it were yesterday; I stood on the left of old West, who I believe is\\n    now at Chelsea--I say to me, who know very well this part of mankind,\\n    I take the gallantry of private soldiers to proceed from the same, if\\n    not from a nobler, impulse than that of gentlemen and officers. They\\n    have the same taste of being acceptable to their friends, and go\\n    through the difficulties of that profession by the same irresistible\\n    charm of fellowship and the communication of joys and sorrows which\\n    quickens the relish of pleasure and abates the anguish of pain. Add to\\n    this that they have the same regard to fame, though they do not expect\\n    so great a share as men above them hope for; but I will engage\\n    Serjeant Hall would die ten thousand deaths rather than that a word\\n    should be spoken at the Red Lettice, or any part of the Butcher Row,\\n    in prejudice to his courage or honesty. If you will have my opinion,\\n    then, of the Serjeant\\'s letter, I pronounce the style to be mixed, but\\n    truly epistolary; the sentiment relating to his own wound in the\\n    sublime; the postscript of Pegg Hartwell in the gay; and the whole the\\n    picture of the bravest sort of men, that is to say, a man of great\\n    courage and small hopes.\"[38]\\n\\nWith such excellences of style and sentiment it is no wonder that the\\n_Tatler_ rapidly established itself in public favour. It was a novel\\nexperience for the general reader to be provided three times a week with\\nentertainment that pleased his imagination without offending his sense of\\ndecency or his religious instincts. But a new hand shortly appeared in the\\n_Tatler_, which was destined to carry the art of periodical essay-writing\\nto a perfection beside which even the humour of Steele appears rude and\\nunpolished. Addison and Steele had been friends since boyhood. They had\\nbeen contemporaries at the Charter House, and, as we have seen, Steele had\\nsometimes spent his holidays in the parsonage of Addison\\'s father. He was\\na postmaster at Merton about the same time that his friend was a Fellow of\\nMagdalen. The admiration which he conceived for the hero of his boyhood\\nlasted, as so often happens, through life; he exhibited his veneration for\\nhim in all places, and even when Addison indulged his humour at his\\nexpense he showed no resentment. Addison, on his side, seems to have\\ntreated Steele with a kind of gracious condescension. The latter was one\\nof the few intimate friends to whom he unbent in conversation; and while\\nhe was Under-Secretary of State he aided him in the production of _The\\nTender Husband_, which was dedicated to him by the author. Of this play\\nSteele afterwards declared with characteristic impulse that many of the\\nmost admired passages were the work of his friend, and that he \"thought\\nvery meanly of himself that he had never publicly avowed it.\"\\n\\nThe authorship of the _Tatler_ was at first kept secret to all the world.\\nIt is said that the hand of Steele discovered itself to Addison on reading\\nin the fifth number a remark which he remembered to have himself made to\\nSteele on the judgment of Virgil, as shown in the appellation of \"Dux\\nTrojanus,\" which the Latin poet assigns to Æneas, when describing his\\nadventure with Dido in the cave, in the place of the usual epithet of\\n\"pius\" or \"pater.\" Thereupon he offered his services as a contributor, and\\nthese were of course gladly accepted. The first paper sent by Addison to\\nthe _Tatler_ was No. 18, wherein is displayed that inimitable art which\\nmakes a man appear infinitely ridiculous by the ironical commendation of\\nhis offences against right, reason, and good taste. The subject is the\\napproaching peace with France, and it is noticeable that the article of\\nforeign news, which had been treated in previous _Tatlers_ with complete\\nseriousness, is here for the first time invested with an air of\\npleasantry. The distress of the news-writers at the prospect of peace is\\nthus described:\\n\\n    \"There is another sort of gentlemen whom I am much more concerned for,\\n    and that is the ingenious fraternity of which I have the honour to be\\n    an unworthy member; I mean the news-writers of Great Britain, whether\\n    Post-men or Post-boys, or by what other name or title soever dignified\\n    or distinguished. The case of these gentlemen is, I think, more hard\\n    than that of the soldiers, considering that they have taken more towns\\n    and fought more battles. They have been upon parties and skirmishes\\n    when our armies have lain still, and given the general assault to many\\n    a place when the besiegers were quiet in their trenches. They have\\n    made us masters of several strong towns many weeks before our generals\\n    could do it, and completed victories when our greatest captains have\\n    been glad to come off with a drawn battle. Where Prince Eugene has\\n    slain his thousands Boyer has slain his ten thousands. This gentleman\\n    can indeed be never enough commended for his courage and intrepidity\\n    during this whole war: he has laid about him with an inexpressible\\n    fury, and, like offended Marius of ancient Rome, made such havoc among\\n    his countrymen as must be the work of two or three ages to repair....\\n    It is impossible for this ingenious sort of men to subsist after a\\n    peace: every one remembers the shifts they were driven to in the reign\\n    of King Charles the Second, when they could not furnish out a single\\n    paper of news without lighting up a comet in Germany or a fire in\\n    Moscow. There scarce appeared a letter without a paragraph on an\\n    earthquake. Prodigies were grown so familiar that they had lost their\\n    name, as a great poet of that age has it. I remember Mr. Dyer, who is\\n    justly looked upon by all the foxhunters in the nation as the greatest\\n    statesman our country has produced, was particularly famous for\\n    dealing in whales, in so much that in five months\\' time (for I had the\\n    curiosity to examine his letters on that occasion) he brought three\\n    into the mouth of the river Thames, besides two porpusses and a\\n    sturgeon.\"\\n\\nThe appearance of Addison as a regular contributor to the _Tatler_\\ngradually brought about a revolution in the character of the paper. For\\nsome time longer, indeed, articles continued to be dated from the\\ndifferent coffee-houses, but only slight efforts were made to distinguish\\nthe materials furnished from White\\'s, Will\\'s, or Isaac\\'s own apartment.\\nWhen the hundredth number was reached a fresh address is given at Shere\\nLane, where the astrologer lived, and henceforward the papers from White\\'s\\nand Will\\'s grow extremely rare; those from the Grecian may be said to\\ndisappear; and the foreign intelligence, dated from St. James\\', whenever\\nit is inserted, which is seldom, is as often as not made the text of a\\nliterary disquisition. Allegories become frequent, and the letters sent,\\nor supposed to be sent, to Isaac at his home address furnish the material\\nfor many numbers. The Essay, in fact, or that part of the newspaper which\\ngoes to form public opinion, preponderates greatly over that portion which\\nis devoted to the report of news. Spence quotes from a Mr. Chute: \"I have\\nheard Sir Richard Steele say that, though he had a greater share in the\\n_Tatlers_ than in the _Spectators_, he thought the news article in the\\nfirst of these was what contributed much to their success.\"[39] Chute,\\nhowever, seems to speak with a certain grudge against Addison, and the\\nstatement ascribed by him to Steele is intrinsically improbable. It is not\\nvery likely that, as the proprietor of the _Tatler_, he would have\\ndispensed with any element in it that contributed to its popularity, yet\\nafter No. 100 the news articles are seldom found. The truth is that Steele\\nrecognised the superiority of Addison\\'s style, and with his usual\\nquickness accommodated the form of his journal to the genius of the new\\ncontributor.\\n\\n    \"I have only one gentleman,\" says he, in the preface to the _Tatler_,\\n    \"who will be nameless, to thank for any frequent assistance to me,\\n    which indeed it would have been barbarous in him to have denied to one\\n    with whom he has lived in intimacy from childhood, considering the\\n    great ease with which he is able to despatch the most entertaining\\n    pieces of this nature. This good office he performed with such force\\n    of genius, humour, wit, and learning that I fared like a distressed\\n    prince who calls in a powerful neighbour to his aid; I was undone by\\n    my own auxiliary; when I had once called him in I could not subsist\\n    without dependence on him.\"\\n\\nWith his usual enthusiastic generosity, Steele, in this passage, unduly\\ndepreciates his own merits to exalt the genius of his friend. A comparison\\nof the amount of material furnished to the _Tatler_ by Addison and Steele\\nrespectively shows that out of 271 numbers the latter contributed 188 and\\nthe former only 42. Nor is the disparity in quantity entirely balanced by\\nthe superior quality of Addison\\'s papers. Though it was, doubtless, his\\nfine workmanship and admirable method which carried to perfection the\\nstyle of writing initiated in the _Tatler_, yet there is scarcely a\\ndepartment of essay-writing developed in the _Spectator_ which does not\\ntrace its origin to Steele. It is Steele who first ventures to raise his\\nvoice against the prevailing dramatic taste of the age on behalf of the\\nsuperior morality and art of Shakespeare\\'s plays.\\n\\n    \"Of all men living,\" says he, in the eighth _Tatler_, \"I pity players\\n    (who must be men of good understanding to be capable of being such)\\n    that they are obliged to repeat and assume proper gestures for\\n    representing things of which their reason must be ashamed, and which\\n    they must disdain their audience for approving. The amendment of these\\n    low gratifications is only to be made by people of condition, by\\n    encouraging the noble representation of the noble characters drawn by\\n    Shakespeare and others, from whence it is impossible to return without\\n    strong impressions of honour and humanity. On these occasions distress\\n    is laid before us with all its causes and consequences, and our\\n    resentment placed according to the merit of the person afflicted.\\n    Were dramas of this nature more acceptable to the taste of the town,\\n    men who have genius would bend their studies to excel in them.\"\\n\\nSteele, too, it was who attacked, with all the vigour of which he was\\ncapable, the fashionable vice of gambling. So severe were his comments on\\nthis subject in the _Tatler_ that he raised against himself the fierce\\nresentment of the whole community of sharpers, though he was fortunate\\nenough at the same time to enlist the sympathies of the better part of\\nsociety. \"Lord Forbes,\" says Mr. Nichols, the antiquary, in his notes to\\nthe _Tatler_, \"happened to be in company with the two military gentlemen\\njust mentioned\" (Major-General Davenport and Brigadier Bisset) \"in St.\\nJames\\' Coffee-House when two or three well-dressed men, all unknown to his\\nlordship or his company, came into the room, and in a public, outrageous\\nmanner abused Captain Steele as the author of the _Tatler_. One of them,\\nwith great audacity and vehemence, swore that he would cut Steele\\'s throat\\nor teach him better manners. \\'In this country,\\' said Lord Forbes, \\'you\\nwill find it easier to cut a purse than to cut a throat.\\' His brother\\nofficers instantly joined with his lordship and turned the cut-throats out\\nof the coffee-house with every mark of disgrace.\"[40]\\n\\nThe practice of duelling, also, which had hitherto passed unreproved, was\\ncensured by Steele in a series of papers in the _Tatler_, which seemed to\\nhave been written on an occasion when, having been forced to fight much\\nagainst his will, he had the misfortune dangerously to wound his\\nantagonist.[41] The sketches of character studied from life, and the\\nletters from fictitious correspondents, both of which form so noticeable\\na feature in the _Spectator_, appear roughly, but yet distinctly, drafted\\nin the _Tatler_. Even the papers of literary criticism, afterwards so\\nfully elaborated by Addison, are anticipated by his friend, who may fairly\\nclaim the honour to have been the first to speak with adequate respect of\\nthe genius of Milton.[42] In a word, whatever was perfected by Addison was\\nbegun by Steele; if the one has for ever associated his name with the\\n_Spectator_, the other may justly appropriate the credit of the _Tatler_,\\na work which bears to its successor the same kind of relation that the\\nfrescoes of Masaccio bear, in point of dramatic feeling and style, to\\nthose of Raphael; the later productions deserving honour for finish of\\nexecution, the earlier for priority of invention.\\n\\nThe _Tatler_ was published till the 2d of January, 1710-11, and was\\ndiscontinued, according to Steele\\'s own account, because the public had\\npenetrated his disguise, and he was therefore no longer able to preach\\nwith effect in the person of Bickerstaff. It may be doubted whether this\\nwas his real motive for abandoning the paper. He had been long known as\\nits conductor; and that his readers had shown no disinclination to listen\\nto him is proved, not only by the large circulation of each number of the\\n_Tatler_, but by the extensive sale of the successive volumes of the\\ncollected papers at the high price of a guinea apiece. He was, in all\\nprobability, led to drop the publication by finding that the political\\nelement that the paper contained was a source of embarrassment to him. His\\nsympathies were vehemently Whig; the _Tatler_ from the beginning had\\ncelebrated the virtues of Marlborough and his friends, both directly and\\nunder cover of fiction; and he had been rewarded for his services with a\\ncommissionership of the Stamp-office. When the Whig Ministry fell in\\n1710, Harley, setting a just value on the abilities of Steele, left him in\\nthe enjoyment of his office and expressed his desire to serve him in any\\nother way. Under these circumstances, Steele no doubt felt it incumbent on\\nhim to discontinue a paper which, both from its design and its traditions,\\nwould have tempted him into the expression of his political partialities.\\n\\nFor two months, therefore, \"the censorship of Great Britain,\" as he\\nhimself expressed it, \"remained in commission,\" until Addison and he once\\nmore returned to discharge the duties of the office in the _Spectator_,\\nthe first number of which was published on the 1st of March, 1710-11. The\\n_Tatler_ had only been issued three times a week, but the conductors of\\nthe new paper were now so confident in their own resources and in the\\nfavour of the public that they undertook to bring out one number daily.\\nThe new paper at once exhibited the impress of Addison\\'s genius, which had\\ngradually transformed the character of the _Tatler_ itself. The latter was\\noriginally, in every sense of the word, a newspaper, but the Spectator\\nfrom the first indulged his humour at the expense of the clubs of\\nQuidnuncs.\\n\\n    \"There is,\" says he, \"another set of men that I must likewise lay a\\n    claim to as being altogether unfurnished with ideas till the business\\n    and conversation of the day has supplied them. I have often considered\\n    these poor souls with an eye of great commiseration when I have heard\\n    them asking the first man they have met with whether there was any\\n    news stirring, and by that means gathering together materials for\\n    thinking. These needy persons do not know what to talk of till about\\n    twelve o\\'clock in the morning; for by that time they are pretty good\\n    judges of the weather, know which way the wind sets, and whether the\\n    Dutch mail be come in. As they lie at the mercy of the first man they\\n    meet, and are grave or impertinent all the day long, according to the\\n    notions which they have imbibed in the morning, I would earnestly\\n    entreat them not to stir out of their chambers till they have read\\n    this paper; and do promise them that I will daily instil into them\\n    such sound and wholesome sentiments as shall have a good effect on\\n    their conversation for the ensuing twelve hours.\"[43]\\n\\nFor these, and other men of leisure, a kind of paper differing from the\\n_Tatler_, which proposed only to retail the various species of gossip in\\nthe coffee-houses, was required, and the new entertainment was provided by\\nthe original design of an imaginary club, consisting of several ideal\\ntypes of character grouped round the central figure of the Spectator. They\\nrepresent considerable classes or sections of the community, and are, as a\\nrule, men of strongly marked opinions, prejudices, and foibles, which\\nfurnish inexhaustible matter of comment to the Spectator himself, who\\ndelivers the judgments of reason and common-sense. Sir Roger de Coverley,\\nwith his simplicity, his high sense of honour, and his old-world\\nreminiscences, reflects the country gentleman of the best kind; Sir Andrew\\nFreeport expresses the opinions of the enterprising, hard-headed, and\\nrather hard-hearted moneyed interest; Captain Sentry speaks for the army;\\nthe Templar for the world of taste and learning; the clergyman for\\ntheology and philosophy; while Will Honeycomb, the elderly man of fashion,\\ngives the Spectator many opportunities for criticizing the traditions of\\nmorality and breeding surviving from the days of the Restoration. Thus,\\ninstead of the division of places which determined the arrangement of the\\n_Tatler_, the different subjects treated in the _Spectator_ are\\ndistributed among a variety of persons: the Templar is substituted for the\\nGrecian Coffee-House and Will\\'s; Will Honeycomb takes the place of\\nWhite\\'s; and Captain Sentry, whose appearances are rare, stands for the\\nmore voluminous article on foreign intelligence published in the old\\nperiodical, under the head of St. James\\'s. The Spectator himself finds a\\nnatural prototype in Isaac Bickerstaff, but his character is drawn with a\\nfar greater finish and delicacy, and is much more essential to the design\\nof the paper which he conducts, than was that of the old astrologer.\\n\\nThe aim of the Spectator was to establish a rational standard of conduct\\nin morals, manners, art, and literature.\\n\\n    \"Since,\" says he in one of his early numbers, \"I have raised to myself\\n    so great an audience, I shall spare no pains to make their instruction\\n    agreeable and their diversion useful. For which reason I shall\\n    endeavour to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with\\n    morality, that my readers may, if possible, both ways find their\\n    account in the speculation of the day. And to the end that their\\n    virtue and discretion may not be short, transient, intermitting starts\\n    of thought, I have resolved to refresh their memories from day to day\\n    till I have recovered them out of that desperate state of vice and\\n    folly into which the age has fallen. The mind that lies fallow but a\\n    single day sprouts up in follies that are only to be killed by a\\n    constant and assiduous culture. It was said of Socrates that he\\n    brought Philosophy down from heaven to inhabit among men; and I shall\\n    be ambitious to have it said of me that I have brought Philosophy out\\n    of closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and\\n    assemblies, at tea-tables and in coffee-houses.\"[44]\\n\\nJohnson, in his _Life of Addison_, says that the task undertaken in the\\n_Spectator_ was \"first attempted by Casa in his book of _Manners_, and\\nCastiglione in his _Courtier_; two books yet celebrated in Italy for\\npurity and elegance, and which, if they are now less read, are neglected\\nonly because they have effected that reformation which their authors\\nintended, and their precepts now are no longer wanted.\" He afterwards\\npraises the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_ by saying that they \"adjusted, like\\nCasa, the unsettled practice of daily intercourse by propriety and\\npoliteness, and, like La Bruyère, exhibited the characters and manners of\\nthe age.\" This commendation scarcely does justice to the work of Addison\\nand Steele. Casa, a man equally distinguished for profligacy and\\npoliteness, merely codified in his _Galateo_ the laws of good manners\\nwhich prevailed in his age. He is the Lord Chesterfield of Italy.\\nCastiglione gives instructions to the young courtier how to behave in such\\na manner as to make himself agreeable to his prince. La Bruyère\\'s\\ncharacters are no doubt the literary models of those which appear in the\\n_Spectator_. But La Bruyère merely described what he saw, with admirable\\nwit, urbanity, and scholarship, but without any of the earnestness of a\\nmoral reformer. He could never have conceived the character of Sir Roger\\nde Coverley; and, though he was ready enough to satirise the follies of\\nsociety as an observer from the outside, to bring \"philosophy out of\\nclosets and libraries, to dwell in clubs and assemblies,\" was far from\\nbeing his ambition. He would probably have thought the publication of a\\nnewspaper scarcely consistent with his position as a gentleman.\\n\\nA very large portion of the _Spectator_ is devoted to reflections on the\\nmanners of women. Addison saw clearly how important a part the female sex\\nwas destined to play in the formation of English taste and manners.\\nRemoved from the pedestal of enthusiastic devotion on which they had been\\nplaced during the feudal ages, women were treated under the Restoration as\\nmere playthings and luxuries. As manners became more decent they found\\nthemselves secured in their emancipated position but destitute of serious\\nand rational employment. It was Addison\\'s object, therefore, to enlist the\\naid of female genius in softening, refining, and moderating the gross and\\nconflicting tastes of a half-civilised society.\\n\\n    \"There are none,\" he says, \"to whom this paper will be more useful\\n    than to the female world. I have often thought there has not been\\n    sufficient pains taken in finding out proper employments and\\n    diversions for the fair ones. Their amusements seem contrived for\\n    them, rather as they are women than as they are reasonable creatures,\\n    and are more adapted to the sex than to the species. The toilet is\\n    their great scene of business, and the right adjustment of their hair\\n    the principal employment of their lives. The sorting of a suit of\\n    ribands is reckoned a very good morning\\'s work; and if they make an\\n    excursion to a mercer\\'s or a toy shop, so great a fatigue makes them\\n    unfit for anything else all the day after. Their more serious\\n    occupations are sewing and embroidery, and their greatest drudgery the\\n    preparations of jellies and sweetmeats. This, I say, is the state of\\n    ordinary women, though I know there are multitudes of those of a more\\n    elevated life and conversation that move in an exalted sphere of\\n    knowledge and virtue, that join all the beauties of the mind to the\\n    ornaments of dress, and inspire a kind of awe and respect, as well as\\n    of love, into their male beholders. I hope to increase the number of\\n    these by publishing this daily paper, which I shall always endeavour\\n    to make an innocent, if not an improving entertainment, and by that\\n    means, at least, divert the minds of my female readers from greater\\n    trifles.\"[45]\\n\\nTo some of the vigorous spirits of the age the mild and social character\\nof the _Spectator\\'s_ satire did not commend itself. Swift, who had\\ncontributed several papers to the _Tatler_ while it was in its infancy,\\nfound it too feminine for his taste. \"I will not meddle with the\\n_Spectator_,\" says he in his _Journal to Stella_, \"let him _fair sex_ it\\nto the world\\'s end.\" Personal pique, however, may have done as much as a\\ndiffering taste to depreciate the _Spectator_ in the eyes of the author\\nof the _Tale of a Tub_, for he elsewhere acknowledges its merits. \"The\\n_Spectator_,\" he writes to Stella, \"is written by Steele, with Addison\\'s\\nhelp; it is often very pretty.... But I never see him (Steele) or\\nAddison.\" That part of the public to whom the paper was specially\\naddressed read it with keen relish. In the ninety-second number a\\ncorrespondent, signing herself \"Leonora,\"[46] writes:\\n\\n    \"Mr. Spectator,--Your paper is a part of my tea-equipage; and my\\n    servant knows my humour so well that, calling for my breakfast this\\n    morning (it being past my usual hour), she answered, the _Spectator_\\n    was not yet come in, but the tea-kettle boiled, and she expected it\\n    every moment.\"\\n\\nIn a subsequent number \"Thomas Trusty\" writes:\\n\\n    \"I constantly peruse your paper as I smoke my morning\\'s pipe (though I\\n    can\\'t forbear reading the motto before I fill and light), and really\\n    it gives a grateful relish to every whiff; each paragraph is fraught\\n    either with useful or delightful notions, and I never fail of being\\n    highly diverted or improved. The variety of your subjects surprises me\\n    as much as a box of pictures did formerly, in which there was only one\\n    face, that by pulling some pieces of isinglass over it was changed\\n    into a grave senator or a merry-andrew, a polished lady or a nun, a\\n    beau or a blackamoor, a prude or a coquette, a country squire or a\\n    conjuror, with many other different representations very entertaining\\n    (as you are), though still the same at the bottom.\"[47]\\n\\nThe _Spectator_ was read in all parts of the country.\\n\\n    \"I must confess,\" says Addison, as his task was drawing to an end,\\n    \"that I am not a little gratified and obliged by that concern which\\n    appears in this great city upon my present design of laying down this\\n    paper. It is likewise with much satisfaction that I find some of the\\n    most outlying parts of the kingdom alarmed upon this occasion, having\\n    received letters to expostulate with me about it from several of my\\n    readers of the remotest boroughs of Great Britain.\"[48]\\n\\nWith how keen an interest the public entered into the humour of the paper\\nis shown by the following letter, signed \"Philo-Spec:\"\\n\\n    \"I was this morning in a company of your well-wishers, when we read\\n    over, with great satisfaction, Tully\\'s observations on action adapted\\n    to the British theatre, though, by the way, we were very sorry to find\\n    that you have disposed of another member of your club. Poor Sir Roger\\n    is dead, and the worthy clergyman dying; Captain Sentry has taken\\n    possession of a fair estate; Will Honeycomb has married a farmer\\'s\\n    daughter; and the Templar withdraws himself into the business of his\\n    own profession.\"[49]\\n\\nIt is no wonder that readers anticipated with regret the dissolution of a\\nsociety that had provided them with so much delicate entertainment.\\nAdmirably as the club was designed for maintaining that variety of\\ntreatment on which Mr. Trusty comments in the letter quoted above, the\\nexecution of the design is deserving of even greater admiration. The skill\\nwith which the grave speculations of the _Spectator_ are contrasted with\\nthe lively observations of Will Honeycomb on the fashions of the age, and\\nthese again are diversified with papers descriptive of character or\\nadorned with fiction, while the letters from the public outside form a\\nrunning commentary on the conduct of the paper, cannot be justly\\nappreciated without a certain effort of thought. But it may safely be said\\nthat, to have provided society day after day, for more than two years,\\nwith a species of entertainment which, nearly two centuries later, retains\\nall its old power to interest and delight, is an achievement unique in the\\nhistory of literature. Even apart from the exquisite art displayed in\\ntheir grouping, the matter of many of the essays in the _Spectator_ is\\nstill valuable. The vivid descriptions of contemporary manners, the\\ninimitable series of sketches of Sir Roger de Coverley, the criticisms in\\nthe papers on _True and False Wit_ and Milton\\'s _Paradise Lost_, have\\nscarcely less significance for ourselves than for the society for which\\nthey were immediately written.\\n\\nAddison\\'s own papers were 274 in number, as against 236 contributed by\\nSteele. They were, as a rule, signed with one of the four letters C. L.\\nI. O., either because, as Tickell seems to hint in his _Elegy_, they\\ncomposed the name of one of the Muses, or, as later scholars have\\nconjectured, because they were respectively written from four different\\nlocalities--viz., Chelsea, London, Islington, and the Office.\\n\\nThe sale of the _Spectator_ was doubtless very large relatively to the\\nnumber of readers in Queen Anne\\'s reign. Johnson, indeed, computes the\\nnumber sold daily to have been only sixteen hundred and eighty, but he\\nseems to have overlooked what Addison himself says on the subject very\\nshortly after the paper had been started: \"My publisher tells me that\\nthere are already three thousand of them distributed every day.\"[50] This\\nnumber must have gone on increasing with the growing reputation of the\\n_Spectator_. When the Preface of the _Four Sermons_ of Dr. Fleetwood,\\nBishop of Llandaff, was suppressed by order of the House of Commons, the\\n_Spectator_ printed it in its 384th number, thus conveying, as the Bishop\\nsaid in a letter to Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, \"fourteen thousand copies\\nof the condemned preface into people\\'s hands that would otherwise have\\nnever seen or heard of it.\" Making allowance for the extraordinary\\ncharacter of the number, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the usual\\ndaily issue of the _Spectator_ to readers in all parts of the kingdom\\nwould, towards the close of its career, have reached ten thousand copies.\\nThe separate papers were afterwards collected into octavo volumes, which\\nwere sold, like the volumes of the _Tatler_, for a guinea apiece. Steele\\ntells us that more than nine thousand copies of each volume were sold\\noff.[51]\\n\\nNothing could have been better timed than the appearance of the\\n_Spectator_; it may indeed be doubted whether it could have been produced\\nwith success at any other period. Had it been projected earlier, while\\nAddison was still in office, his thoughts would have been diverted to\\nother subjects, and he would have been unlikely to survey the world with\\nquite impartial eyes; had the publication been delayed it would have come\\nbefore the public when the balance of all minds was disturbed by the\\ndangers of the political situation. The difficulty of preserving\\nneutrality under such circumstances was soon shown by the fate of the\\n_Guardian_. Shortly after the _Spectator_ was discontinued this new paper\\nwas designed by the fertile invention of Steele, with every intention of\\nkeeping it, like its predecessor, free from the entanglements of party.\\nBut it had not proceeded beyond the forty-first number when the vehement\\npartizanship of Steele was excited by the Tory _Examiner_; in the 128th\\nnumber appeared a letter, signed \"An English Tory,\" calling for the\\ndemolition of Dunkirk, while soon afterwards, finding that his political\\nfeelings were hampered by the design on which the _Guardian_ was\\nconducted, he dropped it and replaced it with a paper called the\\n_Englishman_. Addison himself, who had been a frequent contributor to the\\n_Guardian_, did not aid in the _Englishman_, of the violent party tone of\\nwhich he strongly disapproved. A few years afterwards the old friends and\\ncoadjutors in the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_ found themselves maintaining an\\nangry controversy in the opposing pages of the _Old Whig_ and the\\n_Plebeian_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\n_CATO._\\n\\n\\nIt is a peculiarity in Addison\\'s life that Fortune, as if conspiring with\\nthe happiness of his genius, constantly furnished him with favourable\\nopportunities for the exercise of his powers. The pension granted him by\\nHalifax enabled him, while he was yet a young man, to add to his knowledge\\nof classical literature an intimate acquaintance with the languages and\\ngovernments of the chief European states. When his fortunes were at the\\nlowest ebb on his return from his travels, his introduction to Godolphin\\nby Halifax, the consequence of which was _The Campaign_, procured him at\\nonce celebrity and advancement. The appearance of the _Tatler_, though due\\nentirely to the invention of Steele, prepared the way for development of\\nthe genius that prevailed in the _Spectator_. But the climax of Addison\\'s\\ngood fortune was certainly the successful production of _Cato_, a play\\nwhich, on its own merits, might have been read with interest by the\\nscholars of the time, but which could scarcely have succeeded on the stage\\nif it had not been appropriated and made part of our national life by the\\nviolence of political passion.\\n\\nAddison had not the genius of a dramatist. The grace, the irony, the\\nfastidious refinement which give him such an unrivalled capacity in\\ndescribing and criticising the humours of men as a _spectator_ did not\\nqualify him for imaginative sympathy with their actions and passions. But,\\nlike most men of ability in that period, his thoughts were drawn towards\\nthe stage, and even in Dryden\\'s lifetime he had sent him a play in\\nmanuscript, asking him to use his interest to obtain its performance. The\\nold poet returned it, we are told, \"with many commendations, but with an\\nexpression of his opinion that on the stage it would not meet with its\\ndeserved success.\" Addison, nevertheless, persevered in his attempts, and\\nduring his travels he wrote four acts of the tragedy of _Cato_, the design\\nof which, according to Tickell, he had formed while he was at Oxford,\\nthough he certainly borrowed many incidents in the play from a tragedy on\\nthe same subject which he saw performed at Venice.[52] It is\\ncharacteristic, however, of the undramatic mood in which he executed his\\ntask that the last act was not written till shortly before the performance\\nof the play, many years later. As early as 1703 the drama was shown to\\nCibber by Steele, who said that \"whatever spirit Mr. Addison had shown in\\nhis writing it, he doubted that he would ever have courage enough to let\\nhis _Cato_ stand the censure of an English audience; that it had only been\\nthe amusement of his leisure hours in Italy, and was never intended for\\nthe stage.\" He seems to have remained of the same opinion on the very eve\\nof the performance of the play. \"When Mr. Addison,\" says Pope, as reported\\nby Spence, \"had finished his _Cato_ he brought it to me, desired to have\\nmy sincere opinion of it, and left it with me for three or four days. I\\ngave him my opinion of it sincerely, which was, \\'that I thought he had\\nbetter not act it, and that he would get reputation enough by only\\nprinting it.\\' This I said as thinking the lines well written, but the\\npiece not theatrical enough. Some time after Mr. Addison said \\'that his\\nown opinion was the same with mine, but that some particular friends of\\nhis, whom he could not disoblige, insisted on its being acted.\\'\"[53]\\n\\nUndoubtedly, Pope was right in principle, and anybody who reads the\\nthirty-ninth paper in the _Spectator_ may see not only that Addison was\\nout of sympathy with the traditions of the English stage, but that his\\nwhole turn of thought disqualified him from comprehending the motives of\\ndramatic composition. \"The modern drama,\" says he, \"excels that of Greece\\nand Rome in the intricacy and disposition of the fable--but, what a\\nChristian writer would be ashamed to own, falls infinitely short of it in\\nthe moral part of the performance.\" And the entire drift of the criticism\\nthat follows relates to the thought, the sentiment, and the expression of\\nthe modern drama, rather than to the really essential question, the nature\\nof the action. It is false criticism to say that the greatest dramas of\\nShakespeare fail in morality as compared with those of the Greek\\ntragedians. That the manner in which the moral is conveyed is different in\\neach case is of course true, since the subjects of Greek tragedy were\\nselected from Greek mythology, and were treated by Æschylus and Sophocles,\\nat all events, in a religious spirit, whereas the plays of Shakespeare are\\nonly indirectly Christian, and produce their effect by an appeal to the\\nindividual conscience. None the less is it the case that _Macbeth_,\\n_Hamlet_, and _Lear_ have for modern audiences a far deeper moral meaning\\nthan the _Agamemnon_ or the _Oedipus Tyrannus_. The tragic motive in Greek\\ntragedy is the impotence of man in the face of moral law or necessity; in\\nShakespeare\\'s tragedies it is the corruption of the will, some sin of the\\nindividual against the law of God, which brings its own punishment. There\\nwas nothing in this principle of which a Christian dramatist need have\\nbeen ashamed; and as regards Shakespeare, at any rate, it is evident that\\nAddison\\'s criticism is unjust.\\n\\nIt is, however, by no means undeserved in its application to the class of\\nplays which grew up after the Restoration. Under that _régime_ the moral\\nspirit of the Shakesperian drama entirely disappears. The king, whose\\ntemper was averse to tragedy, and whose taste had been formed on French\\nmodels, desired to see every play end happily. \"I am going to end a\\npiece,\" writes Roger, Earl of Orrery, to a friend, \"in the French style,\\nbecause I have heard the King declare that he preferred their manner to\\nour own.\" The greatest tragedies of the Elizabethan age were transformed\\nto suit this new fashion; even King Lear obtained a happy deliverance from\\nhis sufferings in satisfaction of the requirements of an effeminate Court.\\nAddison very wittily ridicules this false taste in the fortieth number of\\nthe _Spectator_. He is not less felicitous in his remarks on the\\nsentiments and the style of the Caroline drama, though he does not\\nsufficiently discriminate his censure, which he bestows equally on the\\ndramatists of the Restoration and on Shakespeare. Two main characteristics\\nappear in all the productions of the former epoch--the monarchical spirit\\nand the fashion of gallantry. The names of the plays speak for themselves:\\non the one hand, _The Indian Emperor_, _Aurengzebe_, _The Indian Queen_,\\n_The Conquest of Granada_, _The Fate of Hannibal_; on the other, _Secret\\nLove_, _Tyrannic Love_, _Love and Vengeance_, _The Rival Queens_,\\n_Theodosius, or the Power of Love_, and numberless others of the same\\nkind. In the one set of dramas the poet sought to arouse the passion of\\npity by exhibiting the downfall of persons of high estate; in the other\\nhe appealed to the sentiment of romantic passion. Such were the fruits of\\nthat taste for French romance which was encouraged by Charles II., and\\nwhich sought to disguise the absence of genuine emotion by the turgid\\nbombast of its sentiment and the epigrammatic declamation of its rhymed\\nverse.\\n\\nAt the same time, the taste of the nation having been once turned into\\nFrench channels, a remedy for these defects was naturally sought for from\\nFrench sources; and just as the school of Racine and Boileau set its face\\nagainst the extravagances of the romantic coteries, so Addison and his\\nEnglish followers, adopting the principles of the French classicists,\\napplied them to the reformation of the English theatre. Hence arose a\\ngreat revival of respect for the poetical doctrines of Aristotle, regard\\nfor the unities of time and place, attention to the proprieties of\\nsentiment and diction--in a word, for all those characteristics of style\\nafterwards summed up in the phrase \"correctness.\"\\n\\nThis habit of thought, useful as an antidote to extravagance, was not\\nfertile as a motive of dramatic production. Addison worked with strict and\\nconscious attention to his critical principles: the consequence is that\\nhis _Cato_, though superficially \"correct,\" is a passionless and\\nmechanical play. He had combated with reason the \"ridiculous doctrine in\\nmodern criticism, that writers of tragedy are obliged to an equal\\ndistribution of rewards and punishments, and an impartial execution of\\npoetical justice.\"[54] But his reasoning led him on to deny that the idea\\nof justice is an essential element in tragedy. \"We find,\" says he, \"that\\ngood and evil happen alike to all men on this side the grave; and, as the\\nprincipal design of tragedy is to raise commiseration and terror in the\\nminds of the audience, we shall defeat this great end if we always make\\nvirtue and innocence happy and successful.... The ancient writers of\\ntragedy treated men in their plays as they are dealt with in the world, by\\nmaking virtue sometimes happy and sometimes miserable, as they found it in\\nthe fable which they made choice of, or as it might affect their audience\\nin the most agreeable manner.\"[55] But it is certain that the fable which\\nthe two greatest of the Greek tragedians \"made choice of\" was always of a\\nreligious nature, and that the idea of Justice was never absent from it;\\nit is also certain that Retribution is a vital element in all the\\ntragedies of Shakespeare. The notion that the essence of tragedy consists\\nin the spectacle of a good man struggling with adversity is a conception\\nderived through the French from the Roman Stoics; it is not found in the\\nworks of the greatest tragic poets.\\n\\nThis, however, was Addison\\'s central motive, and this is what Pope, in his\\nfamous Prologue, assigns to him as his chief praise:\\n\\n  \"Our author shuns by vulgar springs to move\\n  The hero\\'s glory or the virgin\\'s love;\\n  In pitying love we but our weakness show,\\n  And wild ambition well deserves its woe.\\n  Here tears shall flow from a more generous cause,\\n  Such tears as patriots shed for dying laws:\\n  He bids your breasts with ancient ardour rise,\\n  And calls forth Roman drops from British eyes.\\n  Virtue confessed in human shape he draws--\\n  What Plato thought, and godlike Cato was:\\n  No common object to your sight displays,\\n  But what with pleasure heav\\'n itself surveys;\\n  A brave man struggling in the storms of fate,\\n  And greatly falling with a falling state.\"\\n\\nA falling state offers a tragic spectacle to the thought and the reason,\\nbut not one that can be represented on the stage so as to move the\\npassions of the spectators. The character of Cato, as exhibited by\\nAddison, is an abstraction, round which a number of other lay figures are\\nskilfully grouped for the delivery of lofty and appropriate sentiments.\\nJuba, the virtuous young prince of Numidia, the admirer of Cato\\'s virtue,\\nPortius and Marcus, Cato\\'s virtuous sons, and Marcia, his virtuous\\ndaughter, are all equally admirable and equally lifeless. Johnson\\'s\\ncriticism of the play leaves little to be said:\\n\\n    \"About things,\" he observes, \"on which the public thinks long it\\n    commonly attains to think right; and of _Cato_ it has not been\\n    unjustly determined that it is rather a poem in dialogue than a drama,\\n    rather a succession of just sentiments in elegant language than a\\n    representation of natural affections, or of any state probable or\\n    possible in human life. Nothing here \\'excites or assuages emotion;\\'\\n    here is \\'no magical power of raising fantastic terror or wild\\n    anxiety.\\' The events are expected without solicitude, and are\\n    remembered without joy or sorrow. Of the agents we have no care; we\\n    consider not what they are doing or what they are suffering; we wish\\n    only to know what they have to say. Cato is a being above our\\n    solicitude; a man of whom the gods take care, and whom we leave to\\n    their care with heedless confidence. To the rest neither gods nor men\\n    can have much attention, for there is not one among them that strongly\\n    attracts either affection or esteem. But they are made the vehicles of\\n    such sentiments and such expressions that there is scarcely a scene in\\n    the play which the reader does not wish to impress upon his memory.\"\\n\\nTo this it may be added that, from the essentially undramatic bent of\\nAddison\\'s genius, whenever he contrives a train of incident he manages to\\nmake it a little absurd. Dennis has pointed out with considerable humour\\nthe consequences of his conscientious adherence to the unity of place,\\nwhereby every species of action in the play--love-making, conspiracy,\\ndebating, and fighting--is made to take place in the \"large hall in the\\ngovernor\\'s palace of Utica.\" It is strange that Addison\\'s keen sense of\\nthe ridiculous, which inspired so happily his criticisms on the\\nallegorical paintings at Versailles,[56] should not have shown him the\\nincongruities which Dennis discerned; but, in truth, they pervade the\\natmosphere of the whole play. All the actors--the distracted lovers, the\\ngood young man, Juba, and the blundering conspirator, Sempronius--seem to\\nbe oppressed with an uneasy consciousness that they have a character to\\nsustain, and are not confident of coming up to what is expected of them.\\nThis is especially the case with Portius, a pragmatic young Roman, whose\\npraiseworthy but futile attempts to unite the qualities of Stoical\\nfortitude, romantic passion, and fraternal loyalty, exhibit him in a\\nposition of almost comic embarrassment. According to Pope, \"the love part\\nwas flung in after, to comply with the popular taste;\" but the removal of\\nthese scenes would make the play so remarkably barren of incident that it\\nis a little difficult to credit the statement.\\n\\nThe deficiencies of _Cato_ as an acting play were, however, more than\\ncounterbalanced by the violence of party spirit, which insisted on\\ninvesting the comparatively tame sentiments assigned to the Roman\\nchampions of liberty with a pointed modern application. In 1713 the rage\\nof the contending factions was at its highest point. The Tories were\\nsuspected, not without reason, of designs against the Act of Settlement;\\nthe Whigs, on the other hand, were still suffering in public opinion from\\nthe charge of having, for their own advantage, protracted the war with\\nLouis XIV. Marlborough had been accused in 1711 of receiving bribes while\\ncommander-in-chief, and had been dismissed from all his employments.\\nDisappointment, envy, revenge, and no doubt a genuine apprehension for the\\npublic safety, inspired the attacks of the Whigs upon their rivals; and\\nwhen it was known that Addison had in his drawers an unfinished play on so\\npromising a subject as _Cato_, great pressure was put upon him by his\\nfriends to complete it for the stage. Somewhat unwillingly, apparently, he\\nroused himself to the task. So small, indeed, was his inclination for it,\\nthat he is said in the first instance to have asked Hughes, afterwards\\nauthor of the _Siege of Damascus_, to write a fifth act for him. Hughes\\nundertook to do so, but on returning a few days afterwards with his own\\nperformance, he found that Addison had himself finished the play. In spite\\nof the judgment of the critics, _Cato_ was quickly hurried off for\\nrehearsal, doubtless with many fears on the part of the author. His\\nanxieties during this period must have been great. \"I was this morning,\"\\nwrites Swift to Stella on the 6th of April, \"at ten, at the rehearsal of\\nMr. Addison\\'s play, called _Cato_, which is to be acted on Friday. There\\nwas not half a score of us to see it. We stood on the stage, and it was\\nfoolish enough to see the actors prompted every moment, and the poet\\ndirecting them, and the drab that acts Cato\\'s daughter (Mrs. Oldfield) out\\nin the midst of a passionate part, and then calling out, \\'What\\'s next?\\'\"\\n\\nMrs. Oldfield not only occasionally forgot the poet\\'s text, she also\\ncriticised it. She seems to have objected to the original draft of a\\nspeech of Portius in the second scene of the third act; and Pope, whose\\nadvice Addison appears to have frequently asked, suggested the present\\nreading:\\n\\n  \"Fixt in astonishment, I gaze upon thee\\n  Like one just blasted by a stroke from heaven\\n  Who pants for breath, and _stiffens, yet alive_,\\n  In dreadful looks: a monument of wrath.\"[57]\\n\\nPope also proposed the alteration of the last line in the play from\\n\\n  \"And oh, \\'twas this that ended Cato\\'s life,\"\\n\\nto\\n\\n  \"And robs the guilty world of Cato\\'s life;\"\\n\\nand he was generally the cause of many modifications. \"I believe,\" said he\\nto Spence, \"Mr. Addison did not leave a word unchanged that I objected to\\nin his _Cato_.\"[58]\\n\\nOn the 13th of April the play was ready for performance, and contemporary\\naccounts give a vivid picture of the eagerness of the public, the\\nexcitement of parties, and the apprehensions of the author. \"On our first\\nnight of acting it,\" says Cibber, in his Apology, speaking of the\\nsubsequent representation at Oxford, \"our house was, in a manner,\\ninvested, and entrance demanded by twelve o\\'clock at noon; and before one\\nit was not wide enough for many who came too late for their places. The\\nsame crowds continued for three days together--an uncommon curiosity in\\nthat place; and the death of Cato triumphed over the injuries of Cæsar\\neverywhere.\" The prologue--a very fine one--was contributed by Pope; the\\nepilogue--written, according to the execrable taste fashionable after the\\nRestoration, in a comic vein--by Garth. As to the performance itself, a\\nvery lively record of the effect it produced remains in Pope\\'s letter to\\nTrumbull of the 30th April, 1713:\\n\\n    \"Cato was not so much the wonder of Rome in his days as he is of\\n    Britain in ours; and though all the foolish industry possible had been\\n    used to make it thought a party play, yet what the author said of\\n    another may the most properly be applied to him on this occasion:\\n\\n        \\'Envy itself is dumb, in wonder lost,\\n        And factions strive who shall applaud him most!\\'[59]\\n\\n    The numerous and violent claps of the Whig party on the one side of\\n    the theatre were echoed back by the Tories on the other, while the\\n    author sweated behind the scenes with concern to find their applause\\n    proceeding more from the hand than the head. This was the case, too,\\n    with the Prologue-writer, who was clapped into a staunch Whig at the\\n    end of every two lines. I believe you have heard that, after all the\\n    applauses of the opposite faction, my Lord Bolingbroke sent for Booth,\\n    who played Cato, into the box, between one of the acts, and presented\\n    him with fifty guineas, in acknowledgment, as he expressed it, for\\n    defending the cause of liberty so well against a perpetual dictator.\\n    The Whigs are unwilling to be distanced this way, and therefore design\\n    a present to the same Cato very speedily; in the meantime they are\\n    getting ready as good a sentence as the former on their side; so\\n    betwixt them it is probable that Cato (as Dr. Garth expressed it) may\\n    have something to live upon after he dies.\"\\n\\nThe Queen herself partook, or feigned to partake, of the general\\nenthusiasm, and expressed a wish that the play should be dedicated to her.\\nThis honour had, however, been already designed by the poet for the\\nDuchess of Marlborough, so that, finding himself unable under the\\ncircumstances to fulfil his intentions, he decided to leave the play\\nwithout any dedication. _Cato_ ran for the then unprecedented period of\\nthirty-five nights. Addison appears to have behaved with great liberality\\nto the actors, and, at Oxford, to have handed over to them all the profits\\nof the first night\\'s performance; while they in return, Cibber tells us,\\nthought themselves \"obliged to spare no pains in the proper decorations\"\\nof the piece.\\n\\nThe fame of _Cato_ spread from England to the Continent. It was twice\\ntranslated into Italian, twice into French, and once into Latin; a French\\nand a German imitation of it were also published. Voltaire, to whom\\nShakespeare appeared no better than an inspired barbarian, praises it in\\nthe highest terms. \"_The first English writer who composed a regular\\ntragedy_ and infused a spirit of elegance through every part of it was,\"\\nsays he, \"the illustrious Mr. Addison. His _Cato_ is a masterpiece, both\\nwith regard to the diction and the harmony and beauty of the numbers. The\\ncharacter of Cato is, in my opinion, greatly superior to that of Cornelia\\nin the _Pompey_ of Corneille, for Cato is great without anything of\\nfustian, and Cornelia, who besides is not a necessary character, tends\\nsometimes to bombast.\" Even he, however, could not put up with the\\nlove-scenes:\\n\\n  \"Addison l\\'a déjà tenté;\\n  C\\'étoit le poëte des sâges,\\n  Mais il étoit trop concerté,\\n  Et dans son Caton si vanté\\n  Les deux filles en vérité,\\n  Sont d\\'insipides personages.\\n  Imitez du grand Addison\\n  Seulement ce qu\\'il a de bon.\"\\n\\nThere were, of course, not wanting voices of detraction. A graduate of\\nOxford attacked _Cato_ in a pamphlet entitled _Mr. Addison turned Tory_,\\nin which the party spirit of the play was censured. Dr. Sewell, a\\nwell-known physician of the day--afterwards satirised by Pope as \"Sanguine\\nSewell\"--undertook Addison\\'s defence, and showed that he owed his success\\nto the poetical, and not to the political, merits of his drama. A much\\nmore formidable critic appeared in John Dennis, a specimen of whose\\ncriticism on _Cato_ is preserved in Johnson\\'s _Life_, and who, it must be\\nowned, went a great deal nearer the mark in his judgment than did\\nVoltaire. Dennis had many of the qualities of a good critic. Though his\\njudgment was often overborne by his passion, he generally contrived to\\nfasten on the weak points of the works which he criticised, and he at once\\ndetected the undramatic character of _Cato_. His ridicule of the\\nabsurdities arising out of Addison\\'s rigid observance of the unity of\\nplace is extremely humorous and quite unanswerable. But, as usual, he\\nspoiled his case by the violence and want of discrimination in his\\ncensure, which betrayed too plainly the personal feelings of the writer.\\nIt is said that Dennis was offended with Addison for not having adequately\\nexhibited his talents in the _Spectator_ when mention was made of his\\nworks; and he certainly did complain in a published letter that Addison\\nhad chosen to quote a couplet from his translation of Boileau in\\npreference to another from a poem on the battle of Ramilies, which he\\nhimself thought better of. But the fact seems to have been overlooked that\\nDennis had other grounds for resentment. In the 40th number of the\\n_Spectator_ the writer speaks of \"a ridiculous doctrine of modern\\ncriticism, that they (tragic writers) are obliged to an equal distribution\\nof rewards and punishments, and an impartial execution of poetical\\njustice.\" This was a plain stroke at Dennis, who was a well-known advocate\\nof the doctrine; and a considerable portion of the critic\\'s gall was\\ntherefore expended on Addison\\'s violation of the supposed rule in _Cato_.\\n\\nLooking at _Cato_ from Voltaire\\'s point of view--which was Addison\\'s\\nown--and having regard to the spirit of elegance infused through every\\npart of it, there is much to admire in the play. It is full of pointed\\nsentences, such as--\\n\\n  \"\\'Tis not in mortals to command success,\\n  But we\\'ll do more, Sempronius, we\\'ll deserve it.\"\\n\\nIt has also many fine descriptive passages, the best of which, perhaps,\\noccurs in the dialogue between Syphax and Juba respecting civilised and\\nbarbarian virtues:\\n\\n  \"Believe me, prince, there\\'s not an African\\n  That traverses our vast Numidian deserts\\n  In quest of prey, and lives upon his bow,\\n  But better practises these boasted virtues.\\n  Coarse are his meals, the fortune of the chase;\\n  Amidst the running streams he slakes his thirst,\\n  Toils all the day, and at th\\' approach of night\\n  On the first friendly bank he throws him down,\\n  Or rests his head upon a rock till morn--\\n  Then rises fresh, pursues his wonted game,\\n  And if the following day he chance to find\\n  A new repast, or an untasted spring,\\n  Blesses his stars, and thinks it luxury.\"\\n\\nBut in all those parts of the poem where action and not ornament is\\ndemanded, we seem to perceive the work of a poet who was constantly\\nthinking of what his characters ought to say in the situation, rather than\\nof one who was actually living with them in the situation itself. Take\\nSempronius\\' speech to Syphax, describing the horrors of the conspirator\\'s\\nposition:\\n\\n  \"Remember, Syphax, we must work in haste:\\n  Oh think what anxious moments pass between\\n  The birth of plots and their last fatal period.\\n  Oh! \\'tis a dreadful interval of time,\\n  Filled up with horror all, and big with death!\\n  Destruction hangs on every word we speak,\\n  On every thought, till the concluding stroke\\n  Determines all, and closes our design.\"\\n\\nCompare with this the language of real tragedy, the soliloquy of Brutus in\\n_Julius Cæsar_, on which Addison apparently meant to improve:\\n\\n  \"Since Cassius first did whet me against Cæsar\\n  I have not slept.\\n  Between the acting of a dreadful thing\\n  And the first motion, all the interim is\\n  Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:\\n  The genius and the mortal instruments\\n  Are then in council; and the state of man,\\n  Like to a little kingdom, suffers then\\n  The nature of an insurrection.\"\\n\\nThese two passages are good examples of the French and English ideals of\\ndramatic diction, though the lines from _Cato_ are more figurative than is\\nusual in that play. Addison deliberately aimed at this French manner. \"I\\nmust observe,\" says he, \"that when our thoughts are great and just they\\nare often obscured by the sounding phrases, hard metaphors, and forced\\nexpressions in which they are clothed. Shakespeare is often very faulty in\\nthis particular.\"[60] Certainly he is; but who does not see that, in spite\\nof his metaphoric style, the speech of Brutus just quoted is far simpler\\nand more natural than the elegant \"correctness\" of Sempronius.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nADDISON\\'S QUARREL WITH POPE.\\n\\n\\nIt has been said that with _Cato_ the good fortune of Addison reached its\\nclimax. After his triumph in the theatre, though he filled great offices\\nin the State and wedded \"a noble wife,\" his political success was marred\\nby disagreements with one of his oldest friends; while with the Countess\\nof Warwick, if we are to believe Pope, he \"married discord.\" Added to\\nwhich he was unlucky enough to incur the enmity of the most poignant and\\nvindictive of satiric poets, and a certain shadow has been for ever thrown\\nover his character by the famous verses on \"Atticus.\" It will be\\nconvenient in this chapter to investigate, as far as is possible, the\\ntruth as to the quarrel between Pope and Addison. The latter has hitherto\\nbeen at a certain disadvantage with the public, since the facts of the\\ncase were entirely furnished by Pope, and, though his account was\\ndissected with great acuteness by Blackstone in the _Biographia\\nBritannica_, the partizans of the poet were still able to plead that his\\nuncontradicted statements could not be disposed of by mere considerations\\nof probability.\\n\\nPope\\'s account of his final rupture with Addison is reported by Spence as\\nfollows: \"Philips seems to have been encouraged to abuse me in\\ncoffee-houses and conversations. Gildon wrote a thing about Wycherley in\\nwhich he had abused both me and my relations very grossly. Lord Warwick\\nhimself told me one day \\'that it was in vain for me to endeavour to be\\nwell with Mr. Addison; that his jealous temper would never admit of a\\nsettled friendship between us; and, to convince me of what he had said,\\nassured me that Addison had encouraged Gildon to publish those scandals,\\nand had given him ten guineas after they were published.\\' The next day,\\nwhile I was heated with what I had heard, I wrote a letter to Mr. Addison\\nto let him know \\'that I was not unacquainted with this behaviour of his;\\nthat, if I was to speak severely of him in return for it, it should not be\\nin such a dirty way; that I would rather tell him himself fairly of his\\nfaults and allow his good qualities; and that it should be something in\\nthe following manner.\\' I then subjoined the first sketch of what has since\\nbeen called my satire on Addison. He used me very civilly ever after; and\\nnever did me any injustice, that I know of, from that time to his death,\\nwhich was about three years after.\"[61]\\n\\nSuch was the story told by Pope in his own defence against the charge that\\nhe had written and circulated the lines on Addison after the latter\\'s\\ndeath. In confirmation of his evidence, and in proof of his own good\\nfeeling for and open dealing with Addison, he inserted in the so-called\\nauthorised edition of his correspondence in 1737 several letters written\\napparently to Addison, while in what he pretended to be the surreptitious\\nedition of 1735 appeared a letter to Craggs, written in July, 1715, which,\\nas it contained many of the phrases and expressions used in the character\\nof Atticus, created an impression in the mind of the public that both\\nletter and verses were written about the same time. No suspicion as to the\\ngenuineness of this correspondence was raised till the discovery of the\\nCaryll letters, which first revealed the fact that most of the pretended\\nletters to Addison had been really addressed to Caryll; that there had\\nbeen, in fact, no correspondence between Pope and Addison; and that,\\ntherefore, in all probability, the letter to Craggs was also a fictitious\\ncomposition, inserted in the so-called surreptitious volume of 1735 to\\nestablish the credit of Pope\\'s own story.\\n\\nWe must accordingly put aside, as undeserving of credence, the poet\\'s\\ningeniously constructed charge, at any rate in the particular shape in\\nwhich it is preferred, and must endeavour to form for ourselves such a\\njudgment as is rendered probable by the acknowledged facts of the case.\\nWhat is indisputable is that in 1715 a rupture took place between Addison\\nand Pope, in consequence of the injury which the translator of the _Iliad_\\nconceived himself to have suffered from the countenance given to Tickell\\'s\\nrival performance; and that in 1723 we find the first mention of the\\nsatire upon Addison in a letter from Atterbury to Pope. The question is,\\nwhat blame attaches to Addison for his conduct in the matter of the two\\ntranslations; and what is the amount of truth in Pope\\'s story respecting\\nthe composition of the verses on Atticus.\\n\\nPope made Addison\\'s acquaintance in the year 1712. On the 20th of\\nDecember, 1711, Addison had noticed Pope\\'s _Art of Criticism_ in the 253d\\nnumber of the _Spectator_--partly, no doubt, in consequence of his\\nperception of the merits of the poem, but probably at the particular\\ninstigation of Steele, whose acquaintance with Pope may have been due to\\nthe common friendship of both with Caryll. The praise bestowed on the\\n_Essay_ (as it was afterwards called) was of the finest and most liberal\\nkind, and was the more welcome because it was preceded by a censure\\nconveyed with admirable delicacy on \"the strokes of ill-nature\" which the\\npoem contained. Pope was naturally exceedingly pleased, and wrote to\\nSteele a letter of thanks under the impression that the latter was the\\nwriter of the paper, a misapprehension which Steele at once hastened to\\ncorrect. \"The paper,\" says he, \"was written by one with whom I will make\\nyou acquainted--which is the best return I can make to you for your\\nfavour.\"\\n\\nThese words were doubtless used by Steele in the warmth of his affection\\nfor Addison, but they also express the general estimation in which the\\nlatter was then held. He had recently established his man Button in a\\ncoffee-house in Covent Garden, where, surrounded by his little senate,\\nBudgell, Tickell, Carey, and Philips, he ruled supreme over the world of\\ntaste and letters. Something, no doubt, of the spirit of the coterie\\npervaded the select assembly. Addison could always find a word of\\ncondescending praise for his followers in the pages of the _Spectator_; he\\ncorrected their plays and mended their prologues; and they on their side\\npaid back their patron with unbounded reverence, perhaps justifying the\\nsatirical allusion of the poet to the \"applause\" so grateful to the ear of\\nAtticus:\\n\\n  \"While wits and Templars every sentence raise,\\n  And wonder with a foolish face of praise.\"\\n\\nPope, according to his own account, was admitted to the society, and left\\nit, as he said, because he found it sit too far into the night for his\\nhealth. It may, however, be suspected that the natures of the author of\\nthe _Dunciad_ and of the creator of Sir Roger de Coverley, though touching\\neach other at many points, were far from naturally congenial; that the\\nessayist was well aware that the man who could write the _Essay on\\nCriticism_ had a higher capacity for poetry than either himself or any of\\nhis followers; and that the poet, on his side, conscious of great if\\nundeveloped powers, was inclined to resent the air of patronage with which\\nhe was treated by the King of Button\\'s. Certain it is that the praise of\\nPope by Addison in number 253 of the _Spectator_ is qualified (though by\\nno means unjustly), and that he is not spoken of with the same warmth as\\nTickell and Ambrose Philips in number 523. \"Addison,\" said Pope to Spence,\\n\"seemed to value himself more upon his poetry than upon his prose, though\\nhe wrote the latter with such particular ease, fluency, and\\nhappiness.\"[62] This often happens; and perhaps the uneasy consciousness\\nthat, in spite of the reputation which his _Campaign_ had secured for him,\\nhe was really inferior to such men as John Philips and Tickell, made\\nAddison touchy at the idea of the entire circle being outshone by a new\\ncandidate for poetical fame.\\n\\nWhatever jealousy, however, existed between the two was carefully\\nsuppressed during the first year of their acquaintance. Pope showed\\nAddison the first draft of the _Rape of the Lock_, and, according to\\nWarburton (whose account must be received with suspicion), imparted to him\\nhis design of adding the fairy machinery. If Addison really endeavoured to\\ndissuade the poet from making this exquisite addition, the latter was on\\nhis side anxious that _Cato_, which, as has been said, was shown to him\\nafter its completion, should not be presented on the stage; and his\\nadvice, if tested by the result, would have been quite as open as\\nAddison\\'s to an unfavourable construction. He wrote, however, for the play\\nthe famous Prologue which Steele inserted, with many compliments, in the\\n_Guardian_. But not long afterwards the effect of the compliments was\\nspoiled by the comparatively cold mention of Pope\\'s _Pastorals_ in the\\nsame paper that contained a glowing panegyric on the _Pastorals_ of\\nAmbrose Philips. In revenge, Pope wrote his paper commending Philips\\'\\nperformance and depreciating his own, the irony of which, it is said,\\nescaping the notice of Steele, was inserted by him in the _Guardian_, much\\nto the amusement of Addison and more to the disgust of Philips.\\n\\nThe occasion on which Pope\\'s pique against Addison began to develop into\\nbitter resentment is sufficiently indicated by the date which the poet\\nassigns to the first letter in the concocted correspondence--viz., July\\n20, 1713. This letter (which is taken, with a few slight alterations of\\nnames, from one written to Caryll on November 19, 1712) opens as follows:\\n\\n    \"I am more joyed at your return than I should be at that of the sun,\\n    so much as I wish for him this melancholy wet season; but it has a\\n    fate too like yours to be displeasing to owls and obscure animals who\\n    cannot bear his lustre. What puts me in mind of these night-birds was\\n    John Dennis, whom I think you are best revenged upon, as the sun was\\n    in the fable upon those bats and beastly birds above mentioned, only\\n    by shining on. I am so far from esteeming it any misfortune, that I\\n    congratulate you upon having your share in that which all the great\\n    men and all the good men that ever lived have had their part of--envy\\n    and calumny. To be uncensured and to be obscure is the same thing. You\\n    may conclude from what I here say that it was never in my thoughts to\\n    have offered you my pen in any direct reply to such a critic, but only\\n    in some little raillery, not in defence of you, but in contempt of\\n    him.\"\\n\\nThe allusion is to the squib called _Dr. Norris\\' Narrative of the Frenzy\\nof John Dennis_, which, it appears, was shown to Addison by Pope before\\nits appearance, and after the publication of which Addison caused Steele\\nto write to Lintot in the following terms:\\n\\n    \"Mr. Lintot,--Mr. Addison desired me to tell you that he wholly\\n    disapproves the manner of treating Mr. Dennis in a little pamphlet by\\n    way of Mr. Norris\\' account. When he thinks fit to take notice of Mr.\\n    Dennis\\' objections to his writings, he will do it in a way Mr. Dennis\\n    shall have no just reason to complain of. But when the papers above\\n    mentioned were offered to be communicated to him he said he could not,\\n    either in honour or conscience, be privy to such a treatment, and was\\n    sorry to hear of it.--I am, sir, your very humble servant.\"\\n\\nPope\\'s motive in writing the pamphlet was, as Johnson says, \"to give his\\nresentment full play without appearing to revenge himself\" for the attack\\nwhich Dennis had made on his own poems. Addison doubtless divined the\\ntruth; but the wording of the letter which he caused a third person to\\nwrite to Lintot certainly seems studiously offensive to Pope, who had,\\nprofessedly at any rate, placed his pen at his service, and who had\\nconnected his own name with _Cato_ by the fine Prologue he had written in\\nits praise. Lintot would of course have shown Pope Steele\\'s letter, and we\\nmay be sure that the lofty tone taken by Addison in speaking of the\\npamphlet would have rankled bitterly in the poet\\'s mind.\\n\\nAt the same time Philips, who was naturally enraged with Pope on account\\nof the ridicule with which the latter had covered his _Pastorals_,\\nendeavoured to widen the breach by spreading a report that Pope had\\nentered into a conspiracy to write against the Whigs, and to undermine the\\nreputation of Addison. Addison seems to have lent a ready ear to these\\naccusations. At any rate Pope thought so; for when the good-natured\\npainter Jervas sought to bring about a composition, he wrote to him (27th\\nAugust, 1714):\\n\\n    \"What you mentioned of the friendly office you endeavoured to do\\n    betwixt Mr. Addison and me deserves acknowledgment on my part. You\\n    thoroughly know my regard to his character, and my propensity to\\n    testify it by all ways in my power. You as thoroughly know the\\n    scandalous meanness of that proceeding, which was used by Philips, to\\n    make a man I so highly value suspect my disposition towards him. But\\n    as, after all, Mr. Addison must be the judge in what regards himself,\\n    and has seemed to be no very just one to me, so I must own to you I\\n    expect nothing but civility from him, how much soever I wish for his\\n    friendship. As for any offices of real kindness or service which it is\\n    in his power to do me, I should be ashamed to receive them from any\\n    man who had no better opinion of my morals than to think me a party\\n    man, nor of my temper than to believe me capable of maligning or\\n    envying another\\'s reputation as a poet. So I leave it to time to\\n    convince him as to both, to show him the shallow depths of those\\n    half-witted creatures who misinformed him, and to prove that I am\\n    incapable of endeavouring to lessen a person whom I would be proud to\\n    imitate, and therefore ashamed to flatter. In a word, Mr. Addison is\\n    sure of my respect at all times, and of my real friendship whenever he\\n    shall think fit to know me for what I am.\"\\n\\nIt is evident, from the tone of this letter, that all the materials for a\\nviolent quarrel were in existence. On the one side was Addison, with\\nprobably an instinctive dislike of Pope\\'s character, intensified by the\\ninjurious reports circulated against Pope in the \"little senate\" at\\nButton\\'s; with a nature somewhat cold and reserved; and with something of\\nliterary jealousy, partly arising from a sense of what was due to his\\nacknowledged supremacy, and partly from a perception that there had\\nappeared a very formidable \"brother near the throne.\" On the side of Pope\\nthere was an eager sensitiveness, ever craving for recognition and praise,\\nwith an abnormal irritability prone to watch for, and reluctant to\\nforgive, anything in the shape of a slight or an injury. Slights and\\ninjuries he already deemed himself to have received, and accordingly, when\\nTickell, in 1715, published his translation of the First Book of the\\n_Iliad_ at the same time with his own translation of the first four books,\\nhis smothered resentment broke into a blaze at what he imagined to be a\\nconspiracy to damage his poetical reputation. Many years afterwards, when\\nthe quarrel between Addison and himself had become notorious, he arranged\\nhis version of it for the public in a manner which is, indeed, far from\\nassisting us to a knowledge of the truth, but which enables us to\\nunderstand very clearly what was passing in his own mind at the time.\\n\\nThe subscription for Pope\\'s translation of the _Iliad_ was set on foot in\\nNovember, 1713. On the 10th October, 1714, having two books completed, he\\nwished to submit them--or at any rate he told the public so in 1735--to\\nAddison\\'s judgment. This was at a date when, as he informed Spence, \"there\\nhad been a coldness between Mr. Addison and me\" for some time. According\\nto the letter which appears in his published correspondence, he wrote to\\nAddison on the subject as follows:\\n\\n    \"I have been acquainted by one of my friends, who omits no\\n    opportunities of gratifying me, that you have lately been pleased to\\n    speak of me in a manner which nothing but the real respect I have for\\n    you can deserve. May I hope that some late malevolences have lost\\n    their effect?... As to what you have said of me I shall never believe\\n    that the author of _Cato_ can speak one thing and think another. As a\\n    proof that I account you sincere, I beg a favour of you: it is that\\n    you would look over the two first books of my translation of Homer,\\n    which are in the hands of Lord Halifax. I am sensible how much the\\n    reputation of any poetical work will depend upon the character you\\n    give it. It is therefore some evidence of the trust I repose in your\\n    good will when I give you this opportunity of speaking ill of me with\\n    justice, and yet expect you will tell me your truest thoughts at the\\n    same time you tell others your most favourable ones.\"[63]\\n\\nWhether the facts reported in this letter were as fictitious as we have a\\nright to assume the letter itself to be, it is impossible to say; Pope at\\nany rate told Spence the following story, which is clearly meant to fall\\nin with the evidence of the correspondence:\\n\\n    \"On his meeting me there (Button\\'s Coffee-House) he took me aside and\\n    said he should be glad to dine with me at such a tavern if I would\\n    stay till those people (Budgell and Philips) were gone. We went\\n    accordingly, and after dinner Mr. Addison said \\'that he had wanted for\\n    some time to talk with me: that his friend Tickell had formerly, while\\n    at Oxford, translated the first book of the _Iliad_. That he now\\n    designed to print it, and had desired him to look it over: he must\\n    therefore beg that I would not desire him to look over my first book,\\n    because, if he did, it would have the air of double dealing.\\' I\\n    assured him that I did not take it ill of Mr. Tickell that he was\\n    going to publish his translation; that he certainly had as much right\\n    to translate any author as myself; and that publishing both was\\n    entering on a fair stage. I then added \\'that I would not desire him to\\n    look over my first book of the _Iliad_, because he had looked over Mr.\\n    Tickell\\'s, but could wish to have the benefit of his observations on\\n    my second, which I had then finished, and which Mr. Tickell had not\\n    touched upon.\\' Accordingly, I sent him the second book the next\\n    morning; and in a few days he returned it with very high commendation.\\n    Soon after it was generally known that Mr. Tickell was publishing the\\n    first book of the _Iliad_ I met Dr. Young in the street, and, upon our\\n    falling into that subject, the doctor expressed a great deal of\\n    surprise at Tickell\\'s having such a translation by him so long. He\\n    said that it was inconceivable to him, and that there must be some\\n    mistake in the matter; that he and Tickell were so intimately\\n    acquainted at Oxford that each used to communicate to the other\\n    whatever verses they wrote, even to the least things; that Tickell\\n    could not have been busied in so long a work there without his knowing\\n    something of the matter; and that he had never heard a single word of\\n    it till this occasion.\"[64]\\n\\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that, after the light that has been\\nthrown on Pope\\'s character by the detection of the frauds he practised in\\nthe publication of his correspondence, it is impossible to give any\\ncredence to the tales he poured into Spence\\'s ear, tending to blacken\\nAddison\\'s character and to exalt his own. Tickell\\'s MS. of the translation\\nis in existence, and all the evidence tends to show that he was really the\\nauthor of it. But the above statement may be taken to reflect accurately\\nenough the rage, the resentment, and the suspicion which disturbed Pope\\'s\\nown mind on the appearance of the rival translation. We can scarcely doubt\\nthat it was this, and this alone, which roused him to such glowing\\nindignation and inspired him to write the character of Atticus. When the\\nverses were made public, after Addison\\'s death, he probably perceived that\\nthe public would not consider the evidence for Addison\\'s collusion with\\nTickell to be sufficiently strong to afford a justification for the\\nbitterness of the satire. It was necessary to advance some stronger plea\\nfor such retaliation, especially as rumour confidently asserted that the\\nlines had not been written till after Addison was dead. Hence the story\\ntold by Pope to Spence, proving first that the lines were not only written\\nduring Addison\\'s lifetime, but were actually sent to Addison himself; and\\nsecondly, that they were only composed after the strongest evidence had\\nbeen afforded to the poet of his rival\\'s malignant disposition towards\\nhim. Hence, too, the publication in 1735 of the letter to Craggs, which,\\ncontaining as it did many of the phrases and metaphors employed in the\\nverses, seemed to supply indirect evidence that both were written about\\nthe same period.\\n\\nWith regard to Pope\\'s story, it is not too much to say that it entirely\\nbreaks down on examination. He professes to give it on the authority of\\nLord Warwick himself, reckoning, of course, that the evidence of\\nAddison\\'s own step-son would be conclusive with the public. But Addison\\nwas not married to the Countess of Warwick till August, 1716; and in the\\nprevious May he had bestowed the most liberal praise on Pope\\'s translation\\nin one of his papers in the _Freeholder_. For Lord Warwick, therefore, to\\nargue at that date that Addison\\'s \"_jealous temper_ could never admit of a\\nsettled friendship\" between him and Pope was out of the question. If, on\\nthe other hand, Lord Warwick told his story to Pope before his mother\\'s\\nmarriage, the difficulty is equally great. The letter to Craggs, which, if\\nit was ever sent to the latter at all, must obviously have been written in\\nthe same \"heat\" which prompted the satire on Atticus, is dated July 15,\\n1715. This fits in well enough with the date of the dispute about the\\nrival translations of the _Iliad_, but not with Lord Warwick\\'s story, for\\nWycherley, after whose death Gildon, we are told, was hired by Addison to\\nabuse Pope, did not die till the December of that year.\\n\\nAgain, the internal evidence of the character itself points to the fact\\nthat, when it was first composed, its \"heat\" was not caused by any\\ninformation the poet had received of a transaction between Addison and\\nGildon. The following is the first published version of the satire:\\n\\n  \"If Dennis writes and rails in furious pet\\n  I\\'ll answer Dennis when I am in debt.\\n  If meagre Gildon draw his meaner quill,\\n  I wish the man a dinner and sit still.\\n  But should there _One_ whose better stars conspire\\n  To form a bard, and raise a genius higher,\\n  Blest with each talent and each art to please,\\n  And born to live, converse, and write with ease;\\n  Should such a one, resolved to reign alone,\\n  Bear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne,\\n  View him with jealous yet with scornful eyes,\\n  Hate him for arts that caused himself to rise,\\n  Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer,\\n  And without sneering teach the rest to sneer;\\n  Alike reserved to blame or to commend,\\n  A timorous foe and a suspicious friend,\\n  Fearing e\\'en fools, by flatterers besieged,\\n  And so obliging that he ne\\'er obliged;\\n  Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike,\\n  Just hint the fault, and hesitate dislike,\\n  _Who when two wits on rival themes contest,\\n  Approves of both, but likes the worst the best_:\\n  Like Cato, give his little senate laws\\n  And sits attentive to his own applause;\\n  While wits and templars every sentence praise\\n  And wonder with a foolish face of praise:\\n  Who would not laugh if such a man there be?\\n  Who would not weep if Addison were he?\"\\n\\nThere is sufficient corroborative evidence to allow us to believe that\\nthese lines were actually written, as Pope says, during Addison\\'s\\nlifetime; and if they were, the character of the satire would naturally\\nsuggest that its motive was Addison\\'s supposed conduct in the matter of\\nthe two translations of the _Iliad_. There is nothing in them to indicate\\nany connection in the poet\\'s mind between Gildon and Addison; on the other\\nhand, the allusion to the \"two wits\" shows the special grievance that\\nformed the basis, in his imagination, of the whole character. Afterwards\\nwe find that \"meaner quill\" is replaced by \"_venal_ quill;\" and the\\ncouplet about the rival translations is suppressed. The inference is\\nplain. When Pope was charged with having written the character after\\nAddison\\'s death, he found himself obliged, in self-defence, to furnish a\\nmoral justification for the satire; and, after his own unfortunate manner,\\nhe proceeded to build up for himself a position on a number of systematic\\nfalsehoods. His story was probably so far true that the character was\\nreally written while Addison was alive; on the other hand, it is not\\nunreasonable to conclude that the entire statement about Gildon and Lord\\nWarwick is fabulous; and, as the assertion that the lines were sent to\\nAddison immediately after their composition is associated with these\\nmyths, this, too, may fairly be dismissed as equally undeserving of\\nbelief.\\n\\nAs to the truth of the character of Atticus, however, it by no means\\nfollows, because Pope\\'s account of its origin is false, that the portrait\\nitself is altogether untrue. The partizans of Addison endeavour to prove\\nthat it is throughout malicious and unjust. But no one can fail to\\nperceive that the character itself is a very extraordinary picture of\\nhuman nature; and there is no reason to suppose that Addison was superior\\nto the weaknesses of his kind. On the contrary, there is independent\\nevidence to show that he was strongly influenced by that literary jealousy\\nwhich makes the groundwork of the ideal character. This the piercing\\nintelligence of Pope no doubt plainly discerned; his inflamed imagination\\nbuilt up on this foundation the wonderful fabric that has ever since\\ncontinued to enchant the world. The reader who is acquainted with his own\\nheart will probably not find much difficulty in determining what elements\\nin the character are derived from the substantial truth of nature, and\\nwhat are to be ascribed to the exaggerated perceptions of Genius.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nTHE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE.\\n\\n\\nThe representation of _Cato_ on the stage was a turning point in the\\npolitical fortunes of the Whigs. In the same month the Queen announced, on\\nthe meeting of Parliament, the signature of the Treaty of Utrecht.\\nWhatever were the merits or demerits of the policy embodied in this\\ninstrument, it offered many points of attack to a compact and vigorous\\nOpposition. The most salient of these was, perhaps, the alleged sacrifice\\nof British commercial interests through the incompetence or corruption of\\nthe negotiators, and on this question the Whigs accordingly raised\\nvehement and reiterated debates. Addison aided his political friends with\\nan ingenious pamphlet on the subject, called _The late Trial and\\nConviction of Count Tariff_, containing a narrative of the lawsuit between\\nthe Count and Goodman Fact, which is written with much spirit and\\npleasantry. It is said that he also took the field in answer to the\\nAddress to the Queen from the magistrates of Dunkirk, wherein Her Majesty\\nwas requested to waive the execution of the article in the Treaty\\nproviding for the demolition of the harbour and fortifications of that\\ntown; but if he wrote on the subject the pamphlet has not been preserved\\nby Tickell. His old friend Steele was meanwhile involving himself in\\ndifficulties through the heat and impetuosity of his party passions.\\nAfter the painful abstinence from partizanship imposed on him by the\\nscheme of the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_ he had founded the _Guardian_ on\\nsimilar lines, and had carried it on in a nonpolitical spirit up to the\\n128th number, when his Whig feelings could restrain themselves no longer,\\nand he inserted a letter signed by \"An English Tory,\" demanding the\\nimmediate demolition of Dunkirk. Soon afterwards he published a pamphlet\\ncalled _The Crisis_, to excite the apprehensions of the nation with regard\\nto the Protestant succession, and, dropping the _Guardian_, started the\\n_Englishman_, a political paper of extreme Whig views. He further\\nirritated the Tory majority in Parliament by supporting the proposal of\\nSir Thomas Hanmer, as Speaker of the House of Commons, in a speech\\nviolently reflecting on the rejected Bill for a Treaty of Commerce with\\nFrance. A complaint was brought before the House against the _Crisis_, and\\ntwo numbers of the _Englishman_, and Steele was ordered to attend and\\nanswer for his conduct. After the charge had been preferred against him,\\nhe asked for time to arrange his defence; and this being granted him,\\nafter a warm debate, he reappeared in his place a few days later, and made\\na long and able speech, which is said to have been prepared for him by\\nAddison, acting under the instructions of the Kit-Kat Club. It did not,\\nhowever, save him from being expelled from the House.\\n\\nAddison himself stood aloof, as far as was possible, from the heated\\natmosphere of party, occupying his time chiefly with the execution of\\nliterary designs. In 1713 he began a work on the Evidences of\\nChristianity, which he never finished, and in the last half of the year\\n1714 he completed the eighth volume of the _Spectator_. So moderate was\\nhis political attitude that Bolingbroke was not without hopes of bringing\\nhim over to the Tory side; an interview, however, convinced him that it\\nwas useless to dream of converting Addison\\'s steady constitutional\\nprinciple to his own ambitious schemes.\\n\\nThe condition of the Tory party was indeed rapidly becoming desperate. Its\\nleaders were at open variance with each other. Oxford, a veteran\\nintriguer, was desirous of combining with the Whigs; the more daring and\\nbrilliant Bolingbroke aimed at the restoration of the exiled Stuarts. His\\ninfluence, joined to natural family affection, prevailed with the Queen,\\nwho was persuaded to deprive Oxford of the Treasurer\\'s staff. But her\\nhealth was undermined, and a furious and indecent dispute between the two\\nTory leaders in her own presence completely prostrated her. She was\\ncarried from the Council, and sinking into a state of unconsciousness from\\nwhich she never recovered, died on the 1st of August, 1714.\\n\\nMeantime the Whigs were united and prepared. On the meeting of the\\nCouncil, George I. was proclaimed King without opposition: Lord-Justices\\nwere authorised to administer affairs provisionally, and Addison was\\nappointed their Secretary. It is said, though on no good authority, that\\nhaving, in discharge of his office, to announce to George I. the death of\\nthe Queen, Addison was embarrassed in his choice of phrases for the\\noccasion, and that the duty to which the best writer in the _Spectator_\\nproved unequal was performed by a common clerk. Had Addison been quite\\nunfamiliar with public life this story would have been more credible, but\\nhis experience in Ireland must have made him acquainted with the\\npeculiarities of official English; and some surviving specimens of his\\npublic correspondence prove him to have been a sufficient master in the\\nart of saying nothing in a magnificent way.\\n\\nOn the arrival of the King in England, the Earl of Sunderland was\\nappointed to succeed the Duke of Shrewsbury as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland,\\nand he once more offered Addison the post of Chief Secretary. In that\\noffice the latter continued till the Earl\\'s resignation of the\\nLord-Lieutenancy in August, 1715. It would appear to have been less\\nlucrative to him than when he previously held it, and, indeed, than he\\nhimself had expected; the cause of this deficiency being, as he states,\\n\"his Lordship\\'s absence from that kingdom, and his not being qualified to\\ngive out military commissions.\"[65] He is said, nevertheless, to have\\nshown the strictest probity and honour in his official dealings, and some\\nof his extant correspondence (the authenticity of which, however, is\\nguaranteed only by the unsatisfactory testimony of Curll) shows him to\\nhave declined, in a very high-minded manner, a present of money, evidently\\nintended to secure his interest on behalf of an applicant. He seems to\\nhave been in London almost as much as in Dublin during his tenure of\\noffice, and he found time in the midst of his public business to compose\\nanother play for the stage.\\n\\nThere appears to be no good reason for doubting that _The Drummer_ was the\\nwork of Addison. It is true that it was not included by Tickell in his\\nedition of his friend\\'s writings; and Steele, in the letter to Congreve\\nwhich he prefixed to the second edition of the play, only says that\\nAddison sent for him when he was a patentee of Drury Lane Theatre, and\\ntold him \"that a gentleman then in the room had written a play which he\\nwas sure I should like, but it was to be a secret; and he knew I would\\ntake as much pains, since he recommended it, as I would for him.\" But\\nSteele could, under such circumstances, hardly have been deceived as to\\nthe real authorship of the play, and if confirmatory evidence is required,\\nit is furnished by Theobald, who tells us that Addison informed him that\\nhe had taken the character of Vellum, the steward, from Fletcher\\'s\\n_Scornful Lady_. Addison was probably not anxious himself to assert his\\nright of paternity to the play. It was acted at Drury Lane, and, the name\\nof the author being unknown, was coldly received; a second performance of\\nit after Addison\\'s death, when the authorship was proclaimed, was\\nnaturally more successful; but, in fact, the piece is, like _Cato_, a\\nstanding proof of Addison\\'s deficiency in dramatic genius. The plot is\\npoor and trivial; nor does the dialogue, though it shows in many passages\\ntraces of its author\\'s peculiar vein of humour, make amends by its\\nbrilliancy for the tameness of the dramatic situation.\\n\\nHe was soon, however, called upon to employ his pen on a task better\\nsuited to his powers. In September, 1715, there was a rising in Scotland\\nand in the North of England on behalf of the Pretender. The rebellion was\\nput down with little difficulty, but the position of the House of\\nBrunswick was far more precarious than on the surface it seemed to be. It\\ncould count, no doubt, on the loyalty of a House of Commons elected when\\nthe Tories were momentarily stunned by the death of Queen Anne, on the\\nfaith of the army, and on the support of the moneyed interest. On the\\nother hand, the two most important classes in the kingdom--the landed\\nproprietors and the clergy--were generally hostile to the new _régime_,\\nand the influence exercised by the latter was of course exceedingly great\\nin days when the pulpit was still the chief instrument in the formation of\\npublic opinion. The weight of some powerful writer was urgently needed on\\nthe Whig side, and Addison--who in the preceding August had been obliged\\nto vacate his office of Secretary in consequence of the resignation of the\\nLord-Lieutenant--was by common consent indicated as the man best qualified\\nfor the task. There were indeed hot political partizans who questioned his\\ncapacity. Steele said that \"the Government had made choice of a lute when\\nthey ought to have taken a trumpet.\" But if by the \"trumpet\" he was\\nmodestly alluding to himself, it may very well be doubted if the objects\\nof the Government would have been attained by employing the services of\\nthe author of the _Englishman_. What was wanted was not party invective,\\nbut the calm persuasiveness of reason; a pen that could _prove_ to all\\nTory country gentlemen and thoroughgoing High Churchmen that the\\nProtestant succession was indispensable to the safety of the principles\\nwhich each respectively considered to be of vital importance. This was the\\ntask which lay before Addison, and which he accomplished with consummate\\nskill in the _Freeholder_.\\n\\nThe name of the new paper was selected by him in order to suggest that\\nproperty was the basis of liberty; and his main argument, which he\\nintroduces under constantly varying forms, is that there could be no\\nsafety for property under a line of monarchs who claimed the dispensing\\npower, and no security for the liberties of the Church under kings of an\\nalien religion. In order to secure variety of treatment, the exact social\\nposition of the _Freeholder_ is not defined:\\n\\n    \"At the same time that I declare I am a freeholder I do not exclude\\n    myself from any other title. A freeholder may be either a voter or a\\n    knight of the shire, a wit or a fox-hunter, a scholar or a soldier, an\\n    alderman or a courtier, a patriot or a stock-jobber. But I choose to\\n    be distinguished by this denomination, as the freeholder is the basis\\n    of all other titles. Dignities may be grafted upon it, but this is the\\n    substantial stock that conveys to them their life, taste, and beauty,\\n    and without which they are blossoms that would fall away with every\\n    shake of wind.\"[66]\\n\\nBy this means he was able to impart liveliness to his theme, which he\\ndiversifies by philosophical disquisition; by good-natured satire on the\\nprejudices of the country gentlemen; by frequent papers on his favourite\\nsubject, \"the fair sex;\" and by occasional glances at literature. Though\\nhis avowed object was to prove the superiority of the Whig over the Tory\\ntheory of the Constitution, his \"native moderation\" never deserts him, and\\nhe often lets his disgust at the stupidity of faction, and his preference\\nfor social over political writing, appear in the midst of his argument.\\nThe best papers in the series are undoubtedly the \"Memoirs of a Preston\\nRebel\" and the \"Tory Foxhunter,\" both of which are full of the exquisite\\nhumour that distinguishes the sketches of Sir Roger de Coverley. The\\n_Freeholder_ was only continued for six months (December 23, 1715, to June\\n9, 1716), being published every Friday and Monday, and being completed in\\nfifty-five numbers. In the last number the essayist described the nature\\nof his work, and gave his reasons for discontinuing it:\\n\\n    \"It would not be difficult to continue a paper of this kind if one\\n    were disposed to resume the same subjects and weary out the reader\\n    with the same thoughts in a different phrase, or to ramble through the\\n    cause of Whig and Tory without any certain aim or method in every\\n    particular discourse. Such a practice in political writers is like\\n    that of some preachers taken notice of by Dr. South, who, being\\n    prepared only upon two or three points of doctrine, run the same round\\n    with their audience from one end of the year to the other, and are\\n    always forced to tell them, by way of preface, \\'These are particulars\\n    of so great importance that they cannot be sufficiently inculcated.\\'\\n    To avoid this method of tautology, I have endeavoured to make every\\n    paper a distinct essay upon some particular subject, without deviating\\n    into points foreign to the tenor of each discourse. They are, indeed,\\n    most of them essays upon Government, but with a view to the present\\n    situation of affairs in Great Britain, so that, if they have the good\\n    fortune to live longer than works of this nature generally do, future\\n    readers may see in them the complexion of the times in which they were\\n    written. However, as there is no employment so irksome as that of\\n    transcribing out of one\\'s self next to that of transcribing out of\\n    others, I shall let drop the work, since there do not occur to me any\\n    material points arising from our present situation which I have not\\n    already touched upon.\"\\n\\nIt was probably in reward for his services in publishing the _Freeholder_\\nthat he was made one of the Commissioners for Trade and Colonies. Soon\\nafter his appointment to this office he married Charlotte, Countess of\\nWarwick, daughter of Sir Thomas Myddleton, of Chirk Castle, Denbighshire.\\nHis attachment to the Countess is said to have begun years before; and\\nthis seems not unlikely, for, though the story of his having been tutor to\\nthe young Earl is obviously groundless, two charming letters of his to the\\nlatter are in existence which show that as early as 1708 he took a strong\\ninterest in the family. These letters, which are written entirely on the\\nsubject of birds, may, of course, have been inspired merely by an\\naffection for the boy himself; but it is not unreasonable to suppose that\\nthe writer felt a yet stronger interest in the mother, though her\\nindifference, or his natural diffidence, led him to disguise his feelings;\\nperhaps, indeed, the episode of Sir Roger de Coverley\\'s love passage with\\nthe cruel widow may be founded on personal experience. We have seen him in\\n1711 reporting to a friend that the loss of his place had involved that of\\nhis mistress. Possibly the same hard-hearted mistress condescended to\\nrelent when she saw her former lover once more on the road to high State\\npreferment.\\n\\nReport says that the marriage was not a happy one. The tradition, however,\\nlike so many others about the same person, seems to have been derived from\\nPope, who, in his _Epistle to Arbuthnot_, congratulates himself--with an\\nevident glance at Addison--on \"not marrying discord with a noble wife.\" An\\ninnuendo of this kind, and coming from such a quarter, ought not to be\\naccepted as evidence without some corroboration; and the only\\ncorroboration which is forthcoming is a letter of Lady Mary Wortley\\nMontagu, who writes from Constantinople in 1717: \"I received the news of\\nMr. Addison\\'s being declared Secretary of State with the less surprise in\\nthat I know the post was offered to him before. At that time he declined\\nit; and I really believe he would have done well to decline it now. Such a\\npost as that and such a wife as the Countess do not seem to be, in\\nprudence, eligible for a man that is asthmatic, and we may see the day\\nwhen he will be glad to resign them both.\" Lady Mary, however, does not\\nhint that Addison was _then_ living unhappily with his wife; her\\nexpressions seem to be inspired rather by her own sharp wit and a personal\\ndislike of the Countess than by any knowledge of discord in the household.\\nOn the other hand, Addison speaks of his wife in a way which is scarcely\\nconsistent with what Johnson calls \"uncontradicted report.\" On March 20th,\\n1718, he writes to Swift: \"Whenever you see England your company will be\\nthe most acceptable in the world at Holland House, where you are highly\\nesteemed by Lady Warwick and the young Lord.\" A henpecked husband would\\nhardly have invited the Dean of St. Patrick\\'s to be the witness of his\\ndomestic discomfort. Nor do the terms of his will, dated only a month\\nbefore his death, indicate that he regarded his wife with feelings other\\nthan those of affection and respect: \"I do make and ordain my said dear\\nwife executrix of this my last will; and I do appoint her to be guardian\\nof my dear child, Charlotte Addison, until she shall attain her age of\\none-and-twenty, being well assured that she will take due care of her\\neducation, and provide for her in case she live to be married.\" On the\\nwhole, it seems reasonable to put positive evidence of this kind against\\nthose vague rumours of domestic unhappiness which, however unsubstantial,\\nare so easily propagated and so readily believed.\\n\\nIn April, 1717, the dissensions between the two sections of the Whig\\nCabinet, led respectively by Townshend and Sunderland, reached a climax,\\nand Townshend being worsted, Sunderland became Prime Minister. He at once\\nappointed his old subordinate one of the Secretaries of State, and Addison\\nfilled the office for eleven months. \"It is universally confessed,\" says\\nJohnson, \"that he was unequal to the duties of his place.\" Here again the\\n\"universal confession\" dwindles on examination to something very\\ndifferent. As far as his conduct in administration required to be defended\\nin Parliament, his inaptitude for the place was no doubt conspicuous. He\\nhad been elected member of Parliament for Lostwithiel in 1708, and when\\nthat election was set aside he was chosen for Malmesbury, a seat which he\\nretained for the rest of his life. He made, however, but one effort to\\naddress the House, when, being confused with the cheers which greeted him,\\nhe was unable to complete his sentence, and, resuming his seat, never\\nagain opened his lips.\\n\\nBut in other respects the evidence of his official incapacity seems to\\nproceed solely from his enemies. \"Mr. Addison,\" said Pope to Spence,\\n\"could not give out a common order in writing from his endeavouring always\\nto word it too finely. He had too beautiful an imagination to make a man\\nof business.\"[67] Copies of official letters and despatches written by\\nAddison are, however, in existence, and prove him to have been a\\nsufficient master of a business style, so that, though his lack of ability\\nas a speaker may well have impaired his efficiency as a member of the\\nGovernment, Johnson has little warrant for saying that \"_finding by\\nexperience his own inability_, he was forced to solicit his dismission\\nwith a pension of fifteen hundred pounds a year.\" As a matter of fact,\\nAddison\\'s own petition to the King and his private correspondence prove\\nwith sufficient clearness that his resignation was caused entirely by his\\nfailing health; while the congratulatory Latin verses addressed to him by\\nVincent Bourne, on his recovery from one of his seizures of asthma, show\\nthat his illness was of the most serious nature.\\n\\nHe resigned his post, however, in March, 1718, with cheerful alacrity, and\\nappears to have looked forward to an active period of literary work, for\\nwe are told that he meditated a tragedy on the death of Socrates, as well\\nas the completion of his book on the Evidences of Christianity. But this\\nwas not to be; the exigencies of the Ministry in the following year\\ndemanded the services of his pen. A Peerage Bill, introduced by\\nSunderland, the effect of which was to cause the sovereign to divest\\nhimself of his prerogative of creating fresh peers, had been vehemently\\nattacked by Steele in a pamphlet called the _Plebeian_, published March\\n14, 1719, which Addison undertook to answer in the _Old Whig_ (March 19).\\nThe _Plebeian_ returned to the attack with spirit and with some acrimony\\nin two numbers published March 29th and 30th, and the _Old Whig_ made a\\nsomewhat contemptuous reply on April 2nd. \"Every reader,\" says Johnson,\\n\"surely must regret that these two illustrious friends, after so many\\nyears passed in confidence and endearment, in unity of interest,\\nconformity of opinion, and fellowship of study, should finally part in\\nacrimonious opposition. Such a controversy was \\'Bellum plusquam _civile_,\\'\\nas Lucan expresses it. Why could not faction find other advocates? But\\namong the uncertainties of the human state we are doomed to number the\\ninstability of friendship.\"\\n\\nThe rupture seems the more painful when we find Steele, in his third and\\nlast _Plebeian_, published April 6th, taunting his opponent with his\\ntardiness in taking the field, at the very moment when his former friend\\nand school-fellow--unknown to him of course--was dying. Asthma, the old\\nenemy that had driven Addison from office, had returned; dropsy\\nsupervened, and he died, 17th June, 1719, at Holland House, at the early\\nage of forty-seven. We may imagine the grief, contrition, and remorse that\\nmust have torn the affectionate heart of Steele when he had found he had\\nbeen vexing the last hours of one whom, in spite of all their differences,\\nhe loved so well. He had always regarded Addison with almost religious\\nreverence, which did not yield even to acts of severity on his friend\\'s\\npart that would have estranged the feelings of men of a disposition less\\nsimple and impulsive. Addison had once lent him £1000 to build a house at\\nHampton Court, instructing his lawyer to recover the amount when due. On\\nSteele\\'s failure to repay the money, his friend ordered the house and\\nfurniture to be sold and the balance to be paid to Steele, writing to him\\nat the same time that he had taken the step to arouse him from his\\nlethargy. B. Victor, the actor, a friend of Steele, who is the authority\\nfor the story, says that Steele accepted the reproof with \"philosophical\\ncomposure,\" and that the incident caused no diminution in their\\nfriendship. Political differences at last produced a coldness between\\nthem, and in 1717 Steele writes to his wife, \"I ask no favour of Mr.\\nSecretary Addison.\" Great must have been the revulsion of feeling in a man\\nof his nature when he learned that death had now rendered impossible the\\nrenewal of the old associations. All the love, admiration, and enthusiasm\\nfor Addison, which his heart and memory still preserved, broke out in the\\nletter to Congreve which he prefixed to _The Drummer_.\\n\\nOf the closing scene of Addison\\'s life we know little except on rumour. A\\nreport was current in Johnson\\'s time, and reached the antiquary John\\nNichols at the close of the last century, that his life was shortened by\\nover-drinking. But as usual the scandal, when traced to its source, seems\\nto originate with Pope, who told Spence that he himself was once one of\\nthe circle at Button\\'s, and left it because he found that their prolonged\\nsittings were injuring his health. It is highly probable that Addison\\'s\\nphlegmatic temperament required to be aroused by wine into conversational\\nactivity, and that he was able to drink more than most of his companions\\nwithout being affected by it; but to suppose that he indulged a sensual\\nappetite to excess is contrary alike to all that we know of his character\\nand to the direct evidence of Bishop Berkeley, who, writing of the first\\nperformance of _Cato_, says: \"I was present with Mr. Addison and a few\\nmore friends in a side box, where we had a table and two or three flasks\\nof Burgundy and champagne, with which the author (who is a very sober man)\\nthought it necessary to support his spirits.\"\\n\\nAnother story, told on the same questionable authority, represents him as\\nhaving sent on his death-bed for Gay, and asked his forgiveness for some\\ninjury which he said he had done him, but which he did not specify. From\\nthe more trustworthy report of Young we learn that he asked to see the\\nEarl of Warwick, and said to him, \"See in what peace a Christian can die:\"\\nwords which are supposed to explain the allusion of the lines in Tickell\\'s\\nelegy--\\n\\n  \"He taught us how to live and (oh! too high\\n  The price of knowledge) taught us how to die.\"\\n\\nHis body, after lying in state in the Jerusalem Chamber, was buried by\\nnight in Westminster Abbey. The service was performed by Atterbury, and\\nthe scene is described by Tickell in a fine passage, probably inspired by\\na still finer one written by his own rival and his friend\\'s satirist:\\n\\n  \"Can I forget the dismal night that gave\\n  My soul\\'s best part for ever to the grave?\\n  How silent did his old companions tread,\\n  By midnight lamps, the mansions of the dead,\\n  Through breathing statues, then unheeded things,\\n  Through rows of warriors, and through walks of kings!\\n  What awe did the slow solemn march inspire,\\n  The pealing organ, and the pausing choir;\\n  The duties by the lawn-robed prelate paid,\\n  And the last words that dust to dust conveyed!\\n  While speechless o\\'er the closing grave we bend,\\n  Accept these tears, thou dear departed friend!\\n  Oh gone for ever; take this last adieu,\\n  And sleep in peace next thy loved Montague.\"[68]\\n\\nHe left by the Countess of Warwick one daughter, who lived in his old\\nhouse at Bilton, and died unmarried in 1797.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\nTHE GENIUS OF ADDISON.\\n\\n\\nSuch is Addison\\'s history, which, scanty as it is, goes far towards\\njustifying the glowing panegyric bestowed by Macaulay on \"the unsullied\\nstatesman, the accomplished scholar, the consummate painter of life and\\nmanners, the great satirist who alone knew how to use ridicule without\\nabusing it; who, without inflicting a wound, effected a great social\\nreform; and who reconciled wit and virtue after a long and painful\\nseparation, during which wit had been led astray by profligacy, and virtue\\nby fanaticism.\" It is wanting, no doubt, in romantic incident and personal\\ninterest, but the same may be said of the life of Scott; and what do we\\nknow of the personality of Homer and Shakespeare? The real life of these\\nwriters is to be found in their work; and there, too, though on a\\ndifferent level and in a different shape, are we to look for the character\\nof the creator of Sir Roger de Coverley. But, while it seems possible to\\ndivine the personal tastes and feelings of Shakespeare and Scott under a\\nhundred different ideal forms of their own invention, it is not in these\\nthat the genius of Addison most characteristically embodies itself. Did\\nhis reputation rest on _Rosamond_ or _Cato_ or _The Campaign_, his name\\nwould be little better known to us than any among that crowd of\\nmediocrities who have been immortalised in Johnson\\'s _Lives of the\\nPoets_. The work of Addison consisted in building up a public opinion\\nwhich, in spite of its durable solidity, seems, like the great Gothic\\ncathedrals, to absorb into itself the individuality of the architect. A\\nvigorous effort of thought is required to perceive how strong this\\nindividuality must have been. We have to reflect on the ease with which,\\neven in these days when the foundations of all authority are called in\\nquestion, we form judgments on questions of morals, breeding, and taste,\\nand then to dwell in imagination on the state of conflict in all matters\\nreligious, moral, and artistic, which prevailed in the period between the\\nRestoration and the succession of the House of Hanover. To whom do we owe\\nthe comparative harmony we enjoy? Undoubtedly to the authors of the\\n_Spectator_, and first among these, by universal consent, to Addison.\\n\\nAddison\\'s own disposition seems to have been of that rare and admirable\\nsort which Hamlet praised in Horatio:\\n\\n                              \"Thou hast been\\n  As one in suffering all that suffers nothing:\\n  A man that Fortune\\'s buffets and rewards\\n  Has ta\\'en with equal thanks; and blessed are those\\n  Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled\\n  That they are not a pipe for Fortune\\'s finger\\n  To sound what stop she please.\"\\n\\nThese lines fittingly describe the patient serenity and dignified\\nindependence with which Addison worked his way amid great hardships and\\ndifficulties to the highest position in the State; but they have a yet\\nmore honourable application to the task he performed of reconciling the\\nsocial dissensions of his countrymen. \"The blood and judgment well\\ncommingled\" are visible in the standard of conduct which he held up for\\nEnglishmen in his writings, as well as in his use of the weapon of\\nridicule against all aberrations from good breeding and common-sense.\\nThose only will estimate him at his true worth who will give, what Johnson\\nsays is his due, \"their days and nights\" to the study of the _Spectator_.\\nBut from the general reader less must be expected; and as the first\\nchapter of this volume has been devoted to a brief view of the disorder of\\nsociety with which Addison had to deal, it may be fitting in the last to\\nindicate some of the main points in which he is to be regarded as the\\nreconciler of parties and the founder of public opinion.\\n\\nI have shown how, after the final subversion by the Civil War of the\\nold-fashioned Catholic and Feudal standards of social life, two opposing\\nideals of conduct remained harshly confronting each other in the\\nrespective moral codes of the Court and the Puritans. The victorious\\nPuritans, averse to all the pleasures of sense and intolerant of the most\\nharmless of natural instincts, had oppressed the nation with a religious\\ndespotism. The nation, groaning under the yoke, brought back its banished\\nmonarch, but was soon shocked to find sensual Pleasure exalted into a\\nworship, and Impiety into a creed. Though civil war had ceased, the two\\nparties maintained a truceless conflict of opinion: the Puritan\\nproscribing all amusement because it was patronised by the godless\\nmalignants; the courtiers holding that no gentleman could be religious or\\nstrict in his morals without becoming tainted with the cant of the\\nRoundheads. This harsh antagonism of sentiment is humorously illustrated\\nby the excellent Sir Roger, who is made to moralise on the stupidity of\\nparty violence by recalling an incident of his own boyhood:\\n\\n    \"The worthy knight, being but a stripling, had occasion to inquire\\n    which was the way to St. Anne\\'s Lane, upon which the person whom he\\n    spoke to, instead of answering his question, called him a young\\n    Popish cur, and asked him who made Anne a saint. The boy, being in\\n    some confusion, inquired of the next he met which was the way to\\n    Anne\\'s Lane; but was called a prick-eared cur for his pains, and,\\n    instead of being shown the way, was told that she had been a saint\\n    before he was born, and would be one after he was hanged. \\'Upon this,\\'\\n    says Sir Roger, \\'I did not think it fit to repeat the former question,\\n    but going into every lane of the neighbourhood, asked what they called\\n    the name of that lane.\\'\"[69]\\n\\nIt was Addison\\'s aim to prove to the contending parties what a large\\nextent of ground they might occupy in common. He showed the courtiers, in\\na form of light literature which pleased their imagination, and with a\\ngrace and charm of manner that they were well qualified to appreciate,\\nthat true religion was not opposed to good breeding. To this class in\\nparticular he addressed his papers on Devotion,[70] on Prayer,[71] on\\nFaith,[72] on Temporal and Eternal Happiness.[73] On the other hand, he\\nbrought his raillery to bear on the super-solemnity of the trading and\\nprofessional classes, in whom the spirit of Puritanism was most prevalent.\\n\"About an age ago,\" says he, \"it was the fashion in England for every one\\nthat would be thought religious to throw as much sanctity as possible into\\nhis face, and, in particular, to abstain from all appearances of mirth and\\npleasantry, which were looked upon as the marks of a carnal mind. The\\nsaint was of a sorrowful countenance, and generally eaten up with spleen\\nand melancholy.\"[74]\\n\\nIt was doubtless for the benefit of this class that he wrote his three\\nEssays on Cheerfulness,[75] in which the gloom of the Puritan creed is\\ncorrected by arguments founded on Natural Religion.\\n\\n    \"The cheerfulness of heart,\" he observes in a charming passage, \"which\\n    springs up in us from the survey of Nature\\'s works is an admirable\\n    preparation for gratitude. The mind has gone a great way towards\\n    praise and thanksgiving that is filled with such secret gladness--a\\n    grateful reflection on the Supreme Cause who produces it, sanctifies\\n    it in the soul, and gives it its proper value. Such an habitual\\n    disposition of mind consecrates every field and wood, turns an\\n    ordinary walk into a morning or evening sacrifice, and will improve\\n    those transient gleams of joy, which naturally brighten up and refresh\\n    the soul on such occasions, into an inviolable and perpetual state of\\n    bliss and happiness.\"\\n\\nThe same qualities appear in his dramatic criticisms. The corruption of\\nthe stage was to the Puritan, or the Puritanic moralist, not so much the\\neffect as the cause of the corruption of society. To Jeremy Collier and\\nhis imitators the theatre in all its manifestations is equally abominable:\\nthey see no difference between Shakespeare and Wycherley. Dryden, who\\nbowed before Collier\\'s rebuke with a penitent dignity that does him high\\nhonour, yet rallies him with humour on this point:\\n\\n  \"Perhaps the Parson stretched a point too far\\n  When with our Theatres he waged a war;\\n  He tells you that this very Moral Age\\n  Received the first infection from the Stage;\\n  But sure a banisht Court with Lewdness fraught\\n  The seeds of open Vice returning brought;\\n  Thus lodged (as vice by great example thrives)\\n  It first debauched the daughters and the wives.\"\\n\\nDryden was quite right. The Court after the Restoration was for the moment\\nthe sole school of manners; and the dramatists only reflected on the stage\\nthe inverted ideas which were accepted in society as the standard of good\\nbreeding. All sentiments founded on reverence for religion or the family\\nor honourable industry, were banished from the drama because they were\\nunacceptable at Court. The idea of virtue in a married woman would have\\nseemed prodigious to Shadwell or Wycherley; Vanbrugh had no scruples in\\npresenting to an audience a drunken parson in Sir John Brute; the merchant\\nor tradesman seemed, like Congreve\\'s Alderman Fondlewife, to exist solely\\nthat their wives might be seduced by men of fashion. Addison and his\\ndisciples saw that these unnatural creations of the theatre were the\\nproduct of the corruption of society, and that it was men, not\\ninstitutions, that needed reform. Steele, always the first to feel a\\ngenerous impulse, took the lead in raising the tone of stage morality in a\\npaper which, characteristically enough, was suggested by some reflections\\non a passage in one of his own plays.[76] He followed up his attack by an\\nadmirable criticism, part of which has been already quoted, on Etherege\\'s\\n_Man in the Mode_, the hero of which, Sir Fopling Flutter, who had long\\nbeen the model of young men of wit and fashion, he shows to be \"a direct\\nknave in his designs and a clown in his language.\"[77]\\n\\nAs usual, Addison improves the opportunity which Steele affords him, and\\nwith his grave irony exposes the ridiculous principle of the fashionable\\ncomedy by a simple statement of fact:\\n\\n    \"Cuckoldom,\" says he, \"is the basis of most of our modern plays. If an\\n    alderman appears upon the stage you may be sure it is in order to be\\n    cuckolded. An husband that is a little grave or elderly generally\\n    meets with the same fate. Knights and baronets, country squires, and\\n    justices of the quorum, come up to town for no other purpose. I have\\n    seen poor Dogget cuckolded in all these capacities. In short, our\\n    English writers are as frequently severe upon this innocent, unhappy\\n    creature, commonly known by the name of a cuckold, as the ancient\\n    comic writers were upon an eating parasite or a vainglorious soldier.\\n\\n    \"... I have sometimes thought of compiling a system of ethics out of\\n    the writings of these corrupt poets, under the title of Stage\\n    Morality; but I have been diverted from this thought by a project\\n    which has been executed by an ingenious gentleman of my acquaintance.\\n    He has composed, it seems, the history of a young fellow who has taken\\n    all his notions of the world from the stage, and who has directed\\n    himself in every circumstance of his life and conversation by the\\n    maxims and examples of the fine gentleman in English comedies. If I\\n    can prevail upon him to give me a copy of this new-fashioned novel, I\\n    will bestow on it a place in my works, and question not but it may\\n    have as good an effect upon the drama as Don Quixote had upon\\n    romance.\"[78]\\n\\nNothing could be more skilful than this. Collier\\'s invective no doubt\\nproduced a momentary flutter among the dramatists, who, however, soon\\nfound they had little to fear from arguments which appealed only to that\\nserious portion of society which did not frequent the theatre. But\\nAddison\\'s penetrating wit, founded as it was on truth and reason, was\\nappreciated by the fashionable world. Dorimant and Sir Fopling Flutter\\nfelt ashamed of themselves. The cuckold disappeared from the stage. In\\nsociety itself marriage no longer appeared ridiculous.\\n\\n    \"It is my custom,\" says the _Spectator_ in one of his late papers, \"to\\n    take frequent opportunities of inquiring from time to time what\\n    success my speculations meet with in the town. I am glad to find, in\\n    particular, that my discourses on marriage have been well received. A\\n    friend of mine gives me to understand, from Doctors\\' Commons, that\\n    more licenses have been taken out there of late than usual. I am\\n    likewise informed of several pretty fellows who have resolved to\\n    commence heads of families by the first favourable opportunity. One of\\n    them writes me word that he is ready to enter into the bonds of\\n    matrimony provided I will give it him under my hand (as I now do) that\\n    a man may show his face in good company after he is married, and that\\n    he need not be ashamed to treat a woman with kindness who puts herself\\n    into his power for life.\"[79]\\n\\nSo, too, in politics, it was not to be expected that Addison\\'s moderation\\nshould exercise a restraining influence on the violence of Parliamentary\\nparties. But in helping to form a reasonable public opinion in the more\\nreflective part of the nation at large, his efforts could not have been\\nunavailing. He was a steady and consistent supporter of the Whig party,\\nand Bolingbroke found that, in spite of his mildness, his principles were\\nproof against all the seductions of interest. He was, in fact, a Whig in\\nthe sense in which all the best political writers in our literature, to\\nwhichever party they may have nominally belonged--Bolingbroke, Swift, and\\nCanning, as much as Somers and Burke--would have avowed themselves Whigs;\\nas one, that is to say, who desired above all things to maintain the\\nconstitution of his country. He attached himself to the Whigs of his\\nperiod because he saw in them, as the associated defenders of the\\nliberties of the Parliament, the best counterpoise to the still\\npreponderant power of the Crown. But he would have repudiated as\\nvigorously as Burke the democratic principles to which Fox, under the\\nstimulus of party spirit, committed the Whig connection at the outbreak of\\nthe French Revolution; and for that stupid and ferocious spirit, generated\\nby party, which would deny to opponents even the appearance of virtue and\\nintelligence, no man had a more wholesome contempt. Page after page of the\\n_Spectator_ shows that Addison perceived as clearly as Swift the\\ntheoretical absurdity of the party system, and tolerated it only as an\\nevil inseparable from the imperfection of human nature and free\\ninstitutions. He regarded it as the parent of hypocrisy and\\nself-deception.\\n\\n    \"Intemperate zeal, bigotry, and persecution for any party or opinion,\\n    how praiseworthy soever they may appear to weak men of our own\\n    principles, produce infinite calamities among mankind, and are highly\\n    criminal in their own nature; and yet how many persons, eminent for\\n    piety, suffer such monstrous and absurd principles of action to take\\n    root in their minds under the colour of virtues! For my own part, I\\n    must own I never yet knew any party so just and reasonable that a man\\n    could follow it in its height and violence and at the same time be\\n    innocent.\"[80]\\n\\nAs to party-writing, he considered it identical with lying.\\n\\n    \"A man,\" says he, \"is looked upon as bereft of common-sense that gives\\n    credit to the relations of party-writers; nay, his own friends shake\\n    their heads at him and consider him in no other light than as an\\n    officious tool or a well-meaning idiot. When it was formerly the\\n    fashion to husband a lie and trump it up in some extraordinary\\n    emergency it generally did execution, and was not a little useful to\\n    the faction that made use of it; but at present every man is upon his\\n    guard: the artifice has been too often repeated to take effect.\"[81]\\n\\nSir Roger de Coverley \"often closes his narrative with reflections on the\\nmischief that parties do in the country.\"\\n\\n    \"There cannot,\" says the _Spectator_ himself, \"a greater judgment\\n    befall a country than such a dreadful spirit of division as rends a\\n    government into two distinct people, and makes them greater strangers\\n    and more averse to one another than if they were actually two\\n    different nations. The effects of such a division are pernicious to\\n    the last degree, not only with regard to those advantages which they\\n    give the common enemy, but to those private evils which they produce\\n    in the heart of almost every particular person. This influence is\\n    very fatal both to men\\'s morals and to their understandings; it sinks\\n    the virtue of a nation, and not only so, but destroys even\\n    common-sense.\"[82]\\n\\nNothing in the work of Addison is more suggestive of the just and\\nwell-balanced character of his genius than his papers on Women. It has\\nbeen already said that the seventeenth century exhibits the decay of the\\nFeudal Ideal. The passionate adoration with which women were regarded in\\nthe age of chivalry degenerated after the Restoration into a habit of\\ninsipid gallantry or of brutal license. Men of fashion found no mean for\\ntheir affections between a Sacharissa and a Duchess of Cleveland, while\\nthe domestic standard of the time reduced the remainder of the sex to the\\nposition of virtuous but uninteresting household drudges. Of woman, as the\\ncompanion and the helpmate of man, the source of all the grace and\\nrefinements of social intercourse, no trace is to be found in the\\nliterature of the Restoration except in the Eve of Milton\\'s still\\nunstudied poem: it is not too much to say that she was the creation of the\\n_Spectator_.\\n\\nThe feminine ideal, at which the essayists of the period aimed, is very\\nwell described by Steele in a style which he imitated from Addison:\\n\\n    \"The other day,\" he writes, in the character of a fictitious female\\n    correspondent, \"we were several of us at a tea-table, and, according\\n    to custom and your own advice, had the _Spectator_ read among us. It\\n    was that paper wherein you are pleased to treat with great freedom\\n    that character which you call a woman\\'s man. We gave up all the kinds\\n    you have mentioned except those who, you say, are our constant\\n    visitants. I was upon the occasion commissioned by the company to\\n    write to you and tell you \\'that we shall not part with the men we have\\n    at present until the men of sense think fit to relieve them and give\\n    us their company in their stead.\\' You cannot imagine but we love to\\n    hear reason and good sense better than the ribaldry we are at present\\n    entertained with, but we must have company, and among us very\\n    inconsiderable is better than none at all. We are made for the cements\\n    of society, and come into the world to create relations amongst\\n    mankind, and solitude is an unnatural being to us.\"[83]\\n\\nIn contrast with the character of the writer of this letter--a type which\\nis always recurring in the _Spectator_--modest and unaffected, but at the\\nsame time shrewd, witty, and refined, are introduced very eccentric\\nspecimens of womanhood, all tending to illustrate the derangement of the\\nsocial order--the masculine woman, the learned woman, the female\\npolitician, besides those that more properly belong to the nature of the\\nsex, the prude and the coquette. A very graceful example of Addison\\'s\\npeculiar humour is found in his satire on that false ambition in women\\nwhich prompts them to imitate the manners of men:\\n\\n    \"The girls of quality,\" he writes, describing the customs of the\\n    Republic of Women, \"from six to twelve years old, were put to public\\n    schools, where they learned to box and play at cudgels, with several\\n    other accomplishments of the same nature, so that nothing was more\\n    usual than to see a little miss returning home at night with a broken\\n    pate, or two or three teeth knocked out of her head. They were\\n    afterwards taught to ride the great horse, to shoot, dart, or sling,\\n    and listed themselves into several companies in order to perfect\\n    themselves in military exercises. No woman was to be married till she\\n    had killed her man. The ladies of fashion used to play with young\\n    lions instead of lap-dogs; and when they had made any parties of\\n    diversion, instead of entertaining themselves at ombre and piquet,\\n    they would wrestle and pitch the bar for a whole afternoon together.\\n    There was never any such thing as a blush seen or a sigh heard in the\\n    whole commonwealth.\"[84]\\n\\nThe amazon was a type of womanhood peculiarly distasteful to Addison,\\nwhose humour delighted itself with all the curiosities and refinements of\\nfeminine caprice--the fan, the powder-box, and the petticoat. Nothing can\\nmore characteristically suggest the exquisiteness of his fancy than a\\ncomparison of Swift\\'s verses on a _Lady\\'s Dressing-Room_ with the\\nfollowing, which evidently gave Pope a hint for one of the happiest\\npassages in _The Rape of the Lock_:\\n\\n    \"The single dress of a woman of quality is often the product of a\\n    hundred climates. The muff and the fan come together from the\\n    different ends of the earth. The scarf is sent from the torrid zone,\\n    and the tippet from beneath the Pole. The brocade petticoat rises out\\n    of the mines of Peru, and the diamond necklace out of the bowels of\\n    Indostan.\"[85]\\n\\nTo turn to Addison\\'s artistic genius, the crowning evidence of his powers\\nis the design and the execution of the _Spectator_. Many writers, and\\namong them Macaulay, have credited Steele with the invention of the\\n_Spectator_ as well as of the _Tatler_; but I think that a close\\nexamination of the opening papers in the former will not only prove,\\nalmost to demonstration, that on this occasion Steele was acting as the\\nlieutenant of his friend, but will also show the admirable artfulness of\\nthe means by which Addison executed his intention. The purpose of the\\n_Spectator_ is described in the tenth number, which is by Addison:\\n\\n    \"I shall endeavour,\" said he, \"to enliven morality with wit, and to\\n    temper wit with morality, that my readers may, if possible, both ways\\n    find their account in the speculation of the day. And to the end that\\n    their virtue and discretion may not be short, transient, intermitting\\n    starts of thought, I have resolved to refresh their memories from day\\n    to day till I have recovered them out of that desperate state of vice\\n    and folly into which the age has fallen.\"\\n\\nThat is to say, his design was \"to hold as \\'twere the mirror up to\\nnature,\" so that the conscience of society might recognise in a dramatic\\nform the character of its lapses from virtue and reason. The indispensable\\ninstrument for the execution of this design was the _Spectator_ himself,\\nthe silent embodiment of right reason and good taste, who is obviously the\\nconception of Addison.\\n\\n    \"I live in the world rather as a spectator of mankind than as one of\\n    the species by which means I have made myself a speculative statesman,\\n    soldier, merchant, and artizan, without ever meddling with any\\n    practical part in life. I am very well versed in the theory of a\\n    husband, or a father, and can discern the errors in the economy,\\n    business, and diversion of others better than those who are engaged in\\n    them, as standers-by discover blots which are apt to escape those who\\n    are in the game. I never espoused any party with violence, and am\\n    resolved to observe an exact neutrality between the Whigs and Tories\\n    unless I shall be forced to declare myself by the hostilities of\\n    either side. In short, I have acted in all the parts of my life as a\\n    looker-on, which is the character I intend to preserve in this paper.\"\\n\\nIn order, however, to give this somewhat inanimate figure life and action,\\nhe is represented as the principal member of a club, his associates\\nconsisting of various representatives of the chief \"interests\" of society.\\nWe can scarcely doubt that the club was part of the original and central\\nconception of the work; and if this be so, a new light is thrown on some\\nof the features in the characters of the _Spectator_ which have hitherto\\nrather perplexed the critics.\\n\\n    \"The _Spectator\\'s_ friends,\" says Macaulay, \"were first sketched by\\n    Steele. Four of the club--the templar, the clergyman, the soldier, and\\n    the merchant--were uninteresting figures, fit only for a background.\\n    But the other two--an old country baronet and an old town rake--though\\n    not delineated with a very delicate pencil, had some good strokes.\\n    Addison took the rude outlines into his own hands, retouched them,\\n    coloured them, and is in truth the creator of the Sir Roger de\\n    Coverley and the Will Honeycomb with whom we are all familiar.\"\\n\\nThis is a very misleading account of the matter. It implies that the\\ncharacters in the _Spectator_ were mere casual conceptions of Steele\\'s;\\nthat Addison knew nothing about them till he saw Steele\\'s rough draft; and\\nthat he, and he alone, is the creator of the finished character of Sir\\nRoger de Coverley. But, as a matter of fact, the character of Sir Roger is\\nfull of contradictions and inconsistencies; and the want of unity which it\\npresents is easily explained by the fact that it is the work of four\\ndifferent hands. Sixteen papers on the subject were contributed by\\nAddison, seven by Steele, three by Budgell, and one by Tickell. Had Sir\\nRoger been, as Macaulay seems to suggest, merely the stray phantom of\\nSteele\\'s imagination, it is very unlikely that so many different painters\\nshould have busied themselves with his portrait. But he was from the first\\nintended to be a _type_ of a country gentleman, just as much as Don\\nQuixote was an imaginative representation of many Spanish gentlemen whose\\nbrains had been turned by the reading of romances. In both cases the type\\nof character was so common and so truly conceived as to lend itself easily\\nto the treatment of writers who approached it with various conceptions and\\nvery unequal degrees of skill. Any critic, therefore, who regards Sir\\nRoger de Coverley as the abstract conception of a single mind is certain\\nto misconceive the character. This error lies at the root of Johnson\\'s\\ndescription of the knight:\\n\\n    \"Of the characters,\" says he, \"feigned or exhibited in the\\n    _Spectator_, the favourite of Addison was Sir Roger de Coverley, of\\n    whom he had formed a very delicate and discriminated idea, which he\\n    would not suffer to be violated; and therefore when Steele had shown\\n    him innocently picking up a girl in the Temple and taking her to a\\n    tavern, he drew upon himself so much of his friend\\'s indignation that\\n    he was forced to appease him by a promise of forbearing Sir Roger for\\n    the time to come.... It may be doubted whether Addison ever filled up\\n    his original delineation. He describes his knight as having his\\n    imagination somewhat warped; but of this perversion he has made very\\n    little use. The irregularities in Sir Roger\\'s conduct seem not so much\\n    the effects of a mind deviating from the beaten track of life, by the\\n    perpetual pressure of some overwhelming idea, as of habitual rusticity\\n    and that negligence which solitary grandeur naturally generates. The\\n    variable weather of the mind, the flying vapours of incipient madness,\\n    which from time to time cloud reason without eclipsing it, it requires\\n    so much nicety to exhibit, that Addison seems to have been deterred\\n    from prosecuting his own design.\"\\n\\nBut Addison never had any design of the kind. Steele, indeed, describes\\nSir Roger in the second number of the _Spectator_ as \"a gentleman that is\\nvery singular in his behaviour,\" but he added that \"his singularities\\nproceed from his good sense, and are contradictions to the manners of the\\nworld, only, as he thinks, the world is in the wrong.\" Addison regarded\\nthe knight from a different point of view. \"My friend Sir Roger,\" he says,\\n\"amidst all his good qualities is _something of a humourist_; his virtues\\nas well as imperfections are, as it were, tinged by a certain extravagance\\nwhich makes them particularly his, and distinguishes them from those of\\nother men. This cast of mind, as it is generally very innocent in itself,\\nso it renders his conversation highly agreeable and more delightful than\\nthe same degree of sense and virtue would appear in their common and\\nordinary colours.\"\\n\\nThe fact is, as I have already said, that it had evidently been\\npredetermined by the designers of the _Spectator_ that the Club should\\nconsist of certain recognised and familiar types; the different writers,\\nin turns, worked on these types, each for his own purpose and according to\\nthe bent of his own genius. Steele gave the first sketch of Sir Roger in a\\nfew rough but vigorous strokes, which were afterwards greatly refined and\\naltered by Addison. In Steele\\'s hands the knight appears indeed as a\\ncountry squire, but he has also a town-house in Soho Square, then the most\\nfashionable part of London. He had apparently been originally \"a fine\\ngentleman,\" and only acquired his old-fashioned rusticity of manners in\\nconsequence of a disappointment in love. All his oddities date from this\\nadventure, though his heart has outlived the effects of it. \"There is,\" we\\nare told, \"such a mirthful cast in his behaviour that he is rather beloved\\nthan esteemed.\" Steele\\'s imagination had evidently been chiefly caught by\\nthe humour of Sir Roger\\'s love affair, which is made to reflect the\\nromantic cast of poetry affected after the Restoration, and forms the\\nsubject of two papers in the series; in two others--recording respectively\\nthe knight\\'s kindness to his servants, and his remarks on the portraits of\\nhis ancestors--the writer takes up the idea of Addison; while another\\ngives an account of a dispute between Sir Roger and Sir Andrew Freeport on\\nthe merits of the moneyed interest. Addison, on the other hand, had formed\\na far finer conception of the character of the country gentleman, and one\\nthat approaches the portrait of Don Quixote. As a humourist he perceived\\nthe incongruous position in modern society of one nourished in the\\nbeliefs, principles, and traditions of the old feudal world; and hence,\\nwhenever the knight is brought into contact with modern ideas, he invests\\nhis observations, as the _Spectator_ says, with \"a certain extravagance\"\\nwhich constitutes their charm. Such are the papers describing his\\nbehaviour at church, his inclination to believe in witchcraft, and his\\nTory principles; such, in another vein, are his criticisms in the theatre,\\nhis opinions of Spring Gardens, and his delightful reflections on the\\ntombs in Westminster Abbey. But Addison was also fully alive to the beauty\\nand nobility of the feudal idea, which he brings out with great animation\\nin the various papers describing the patriarchal relations existing\\nbetween Sir Roger and his servants, retainers, and tenants, closing the\\nseries with the truly pathetic account of the knight\\'s death. It is to be\\nobserved that he drops altogether Steele\\'s idea of Sir Roger having once\\nbeen a man of fashion, which is indeed discarded by Steele himself when\\nco-operating with his friend on the picture of country life. Addison also\\nquite disregards Steele\\'s original hint about \"the humble desires\" of his\\nhero; and he only once makes incidental mention of the widow.\\n\\nBudgell contributed three papers on the subject--two in imitation of\\nAddison; one describing a fox-hunt, and the other giving Sir Roger\\'s\\nopinion on beards; the third, in imitation of Steele, showing Sir Roger\\'s\\nstate of mind on hearing of the addresses of Sir David Dundrum to the\\nwidow. The number of the _Spectator_ which is said to have so greatly\\ndispleased Addison was written, not, as Johnson says, by Steele, but by\\nTickell. It goes far to confirm my supposition that the characters of the\\nClub had been agreed upon beforehand. The trait which Tickell describes\\nwould have been natural enough in an ordinary country gentleman, though it\\nwas inconsistent with the fine development of Sir Roger\\'s character in the\\nhands of Addison.\\n\\nIn his capacity of critic Addison has been variously judged, and, it may\\nbe added, generally undervalued. We find that Johnson\\'s contemporaries\\nwere reluctant to allow him the name of critic. \"His criticism,\" Johnson\\nexplains, \"is condemned as tentative or experimental rather than\\nscientific; and he is considered as deciding by taste rather than by\\nprinciples.\" But if Aristotle is right in saying that the virtuous man is\\nthe standard of virtue, the man of sound instincts and perceptions ought\\ncertainly to be accepted as a standard in the more debatable region of\\ntaste. There can, at any rate, be no doubt that Addison\\'s artistic\\njudgments, founded on instinct, were frequently much nearer the mark than\\nJohnson\\'s, though these were based on principle. Again, Macaulay says,\\n\"The least valuable of Addison\\'s contributions to the _Spectator_ are, in\\nthe judgment of our age, his critical papers;\" but he adds, patronisingly,\\n\"The very worst of them is creditable to him when the character of the\\nschool in which he had been trained is fairly considered. The best of them\\nwere much too good for his readers. In truth, he was not so far behind our\\ngeneration as he was before his own.\" By \"the school in which he had been\\ntrained,\" Macaulay doubtless meant the critical traditions established by\\nBoileau and Bouhours, and he would have justified the disparagement\\nimplied in his reference to them by pointing to the pedantic intolerance\\nand narrowness of view which these traditions encouraged. But in all\\nmatters of this kind there is loss and gain. If Addison\\'s generation was\\nmuch more insensible than our own to a large portion of imaginative truth,\\nit had a far keener perception of the laws and limits of expression; and,\\ngranted that Voltaire was wrong in regarding Shakespeare as an \"inspired\\nbarbarian,\" he would never have made the mistake which critics now make\\nevery day of mistaking nonsense for poetry.\\n\\nBut it may well be questioned if Addison\\'s criticism is only \"tentative\\nand experimental.\" The end of criticism is surely to produce a habit of\\nreasoning rightly on matters of taste and imagination; and, with the\\nexception of Sir Joshua Reynolds, no English critic has accomplished more\\nin this direction than Addison. Before his time Dryden had scattered over\\na number of prefaces various critical remarks, admirably felicitous in\\nthought and racy in expression. But he had made no attempt to write upon\\nthe subject systematically; and in practice he gave himself up without an\\neffort to satisfy the tastes which a corrupt Court had formed, partly on\\nthe \"false wit\" of Cowley\\'s following, partly on the extravagance and\\nconceit of the French school of Romance. Addison, on the other hand, set\\nhimself to correct this depraved fashion by establishing in England, on a\\nlarger and more liberal basis, the standards of good breeding and\\ncommon-sense which Boileau had already popularised in France. Nothing can\\nbe more just and discriminating than his papers on the difference between\\ntrue and false wit.[86] He was the first to endeavour to define the limits\\nof art and taste in his essays on the _Pleasures of the Imagination_;[87]\\nand though his theory on the subject is obviously superficial, it\\nsufficiently proves that his method of reasoning on questions of taste was\\nmuch more than \"tentative and experimental.\" \"I could wish,\" he says,\\n\"there were authors who, beside the mechanical rules which a man of very\\nlittle taste may discourse upon, would enter into the very spirit and soul\\nof fine writing, and show us the several sources of that pleasure which\\nrises in the mind on the perusal of a noble work.\" His studies of the\\nFrench drama prevented him from appreciating the great Elizabethan school\\nof tragedy, yet many stray remarks in the _Spectator_ show how deeply he\\nwas impressed by the greatness of Shakespeare\\'s genius, while his\\ncriticisms on Tragedy did much to banish the tumid extravagance of the\\nromantic style. His papers on Milton achieved the triumph of making a\\npractically unknown poem one of the most popular classics in the language,\\nand he was more than half a century before his age in his appreciation of\\nthe beauties of the English ballads. In fact, finding English taste in\\nhopeless confusion, he left it in admirable order; and to those who are\\ninclined to depreciate his powers as a critic the following observations\\nof Johnson--not a very favourable judge--may be commended:\\n\\n    \"It is not uncommon for those who have grown wise by the labour of\\n    others to add a little of their own, and overlook their masters.\\n    Addison is now despised by some who perhaps would never have seen his\\n    defects but by the light he afforded them. That he always wrote as he\\n    would write now cannot be affirmed; his instructions were such as the\\n    characters of his readers made proper. That general knowledge which\\n    now circulates in common talk was in his time rarely to be found. Men\\n    not professing learning were not ashamed of ignorance; and in the\\n    female world any acquaintance with books was distinguished only to be\\n    censured. His purpose was to infuse literary curiosity by gentle and\\n    unsuspected conveyance into the gay, the idle, and the wealthy; he\\n    therefore presented knowledge in the most alluring form, not lofty and\\n    austere, but accessible and familiar. When he showed them their\\n    defects, he showed them likewise that they might be easily supplied.\\n    His attempt succeeded; inquiry awakened and comprehension expanded. An\\n    emulation of intellectual elegance was excited, and from this time to\\n    our own life has been gradually exalted, and conversation purified and\\n    enlarged.\"[88]\\n\\nThe essence of Addison\\'s humour is irony. \"One slight lineament of his\\ncharacter,\" says Johnson, \"Swift has preserved. It was his practice, when\\nhe found any man invincibly wrong, to flatter his opinions by acquiescence\\nand sink him yet deeper to absurdity.\" The same characteristic manifests\\nitself in his writings under a great variety of forms. Sometimes it\\nappears in the seemingly logical premises from which he draws an obviously\\nabsurd conclusion, as for instance:\\n\\n    \"If in a multitude of counsellors there is safety, we ought to think\\n    ourselves the securest nation in the world. Most of our garrets are\\n    inhabited by statesmen, who watch over the liberties of their country,\\n    and make a shift to keep themselves from starving by taking into their\\n    care the properties of all their fellow-subjects.\"[89]\\n\\nOn other occasions he ridicules some fashion of taste by a perfectly grave\\nand simple description of its object. Perhaps the most admirable specimen\\nof this oblique manner is his satire on the Italian opera in the number of\\nthe _Spectator_ describing the various lions who had fought on the stage\\nwith Nicolini. This highly-finished paper deserves to be quoted _in\\nextenso_:\\n\\n    \"There is nothing of late years has afforded matter of greater\\n    amusement to the town than Signor Nicolini\\'s combat with a lion in the\\n    Haymarket, which has been very often exhibited to the general\\n    satisfaction of most of the nobility and gentry in the kingdom of\\n    Great Britain. Upon the first rumour of this intended combat it was\\n    confidently affirmed, and is still believed by many in both galleries,\\n    that there would be a tame lion sent from the tower every opera in\\n    order to be killed by Hydaspes. This report, though altogether\\n    groundless, so universally prevailed in the upper regions of the\\n    playhouse, that some of the refined politicians in those parts of the\\n    audience gave it out in a whisper that the lion was a cousin-german of\\n    the tiger who made his appearance in King William\\'s days, and that the\\n    stage would be supplied with lions at the public expense during the\\n    whole session. Many, likewise, were the conjectures of the treatment\\n    which this lion was to meet with at the hands of Signor Nicolini;\\n    some supposed that he was to subdue him in recitativo, as Orpheus used\\n    to serve the wild beasts in his time, and afterwards to knock him on\\n    the head; some fancied that the lion would not pretend to lay his paws\\n    upon the hero, by reason of the received opinion that a lion will not\\n    hurt a virgin; several, who pretended to have seen the opera in Italy,\\n    had informed their friends that the lion was to act a part in High\\n    Dutch, and roar twice or thrice to a thorough-bass before he fell at\\n    the feet of Hydaspes. To clear up a matter that was so variously\\n    reported, I have made it my business to examine whether this pretended\\n    lion is really the savage he appears to be or only a counterfeit.\\n\\n    \"But, before I communicate my discoveries, I must acquaint the public\\n    that upon my walking behind the scenes last winter, as I was thinking\\n    upon something else, I accidentally jostled against an enormous animal\\n    that extremely startled me, and, upon my nearer survey of it, appeared\\n    to be a lion rampant. The lion, seeing me very much surprised, told\\n    me, in a gentle voice, that I might come by him if I pleased; \\'for,\\'\\n    says he, \\'I do not intend to hurt anybody.\\' I thanked him very kindly\\n    and passed by him, and in a little time after saw him leap upon the\\n    stage and act his part with very great applause. It has been observed\\n    by several that the lion has changed his manner of acting twice or\\n    thrice since his first appearance; which will not seem strange when I\\n    acquaint my reader that the lion has been changed upon the audience\\n    three several times. The first lion was a candle-snuffer, who, being a\\n    fellow of testy, choleric temper, overdid his part, and would not\\n    suffer himself to be killed so easily as he ought to have done;\\n    besides, it was observed of him that he became more surly every time\\n    he came out of the lion; and having dropped some words in ordinary\\n    conversation as if he had not fought his best, and that he suffered\\n    himself to be thrown on his back in the scuffle, and that he could\\n    wrestle with Mr. Nicolini for what he pleased out of his lion\\'s skin,\\n    it was thought proper to discard him; and it is verily believed to\\n    this day that, had he been brought upon the stage another time, he\\n    would certainly have done mischief. Besides, it was objected against\\n    the first lion that he reared himself so high upon his hinder paws and\\n    walked in so erect a posture that he looked more like an old man than\\n    a lion.\\n\\n    \"The second lion was a tailor by trade, who belonged to the playhouse,\\n    and had the character of a mild and peaceable man in his profession.\\n    If the former was too furious, this was too sheepish for his part,\\n    insomuch that, after a short, modest walk upon the stage, he would\\n    fall at the first touch of Hydaspes, without grappling with him and\\n    giving him an opportunity of showing his variety of Italian trips. It\\n    is said, indeed, that he once gave him a rip in his flesh-coloured\\n    doublet; but this was only to make work for himself in his private\\n    character of a tailor. I must not omit that it was this second lion\\n    who treated me with so much humanity behind the scenes.\\n\\n    \"The acting lion at present is, as I am informed, a country gentleman,\\n    who does it for his diversion, but desires his name may be concealed.\\n    He says, very handsomely in his own excuse, that he does not act for\\n    gain; that he indulges an innocent pleasure in it; and that it is\\n    better to pass away an evening in this manner than in gaming and\\n    drinking; but he says at the same time, with a very agreeable raillery\\n    upon himself, that, if his name were known, the ill-natured world\\n    might call him \\'the ass in the lion\\'s skin.\\' This gentleman\\'s temper\\n    is made out of such a happy mixture of the mild and the choleric that\\n    he outdoes both his predecessors, and has drawn together greater\\n    audiences than have been known in the memory of man.\\n\\n    \"I must not conclude my narrative without taking notice of a\\n    groundless report that has been raised to a gentleman\\'s disadvantage\\n    of whom I must declare myself an admirer; namely, that Signor Nicolini\\n    and the lion have been seen sitting peaceably by one another and\\n    smoking a pipe together behind the scenes; by which their common\\n    enemies would insinuate that it is but a sham combat which they\\n    represent upon the stage; but upon inquiry I find that, if any such\\n    correspondence has passed between them, it was not till the combat was\\n    over, when the lion was to be looked on as dead, according to the\\n    received rules of the drama. Besides, this is what is practised every\\n    day in Westminster Hall, where nothing is more usual than to see a\\n    couple of lawyers who have been tearing each other to pieces in the\\n    court embracing one another as soon as they are out of it.\"[90]\\n\\nIn a somewhat different vein, the ridicule cast by the _Spectator_ on the\\nfashions of his day, by anticipating the judgment of posterity on himself,\\nis equally happy:\\n\\n    \"As for his speculations, notwithstanding the several obsolete words\\n    and obscure phrases of the age in which he lived, we still understand\\n    enough of them to see the diversions and characters of the English\\n    nation in his time; not but that we are to make allowance for the\\n    mirth and humour of the author, who has doubtless strained many\\n    representations of things beyond the truth. For, if we must interpret\\n    his words in their literal meaning, we must suppose that women of the\\n    first quality used to pass away whole mornings at a puppet show; that\\n    they attested their principles by their patches; that an audience\\n    would sit out an evening to hear a dramatical performance written in a\\n    language which they did not understand; that chairs and flowerpots\\n    were introduced as actors upon the British stage; that a promiscuous\\n    assembly of men and women were allowed to meet at midnight in masks\\n    within the verge of the Court; with many improbabilities of the like\\n    nature. We must, therefore, in these and in the like cases, suppose\\n    that these remote hints and allusions aimed at some certain follies\\n    which were then in vogue, and which at present we have not any notion\\n    of.\"[91]\\n\\nHis power of ridiculing keenly without malignity is of course best shown\\nin his character of Sir Roger de Coverley, whose delightful simplicity of\\nmind is made the medium of much good-natured satire on the manners of the\\nTory country gentlemen of the period. One of the most exquisite touches is\\nthe description of the extraordinary conversion of a dissenter by the Act\\nagainst Occasional Conformity.\\n\\n    \"He (Sir Roger) then launched out into praise of the late Act of\\n    Parliament for securing the Church of England, and told me with great\\n    satisfaction that he believed it already began to take effect, for\\n    that a rigid dissenter who chanced to dine in his house on Christmas\\n    day had been observed to eat very plentifully of his\\n    plum-porridge.\"[92]\\n\\nThe mixture of fashionable contempt for book-learning, blended with shrewd\\nmother-wit, is well represented in the character of Will Honeycomb, who\\n\"had the discretion not to go out of his depth, and had often a certain\\nway of making his real ignorance appear a seeming one.\" One of Will\\'s\\nhappiest flights is on the subject of ancient looking-glasses. \"Nay,\" says\\nhe, \"I remember Mr. Dryden in his _Ovid_ tells us of a swinging fellow\\ncalled Polypheme, that made use of the sea for his looking-glass, and\\ncould never dress himself to advantage but in a calm.\"\\n\\nBudgell, Steele, and Addison seem all to have worked on the character of\\nWill Honeycomb, which, however, presents none of the inconsistencies that\\nappear in the portrait of Sir Roger de Coverley. Addison was evidently\\npleased with it, and in his own inimitable ironic manner gave it its\\nfinishing touches by making Will, in his character of a fashionable\\ngallant, write two letters scoffing at wedlock and then marry a farmer\\'s\\ndaughter. The conclusion of the letter in which he announces his fate to\\nthe _Spectator_ is an admirable specimen of Addison\\'s humour:\\n\\n    \"As for your fine women I need not tell thee that I know them. I have\\n    had my share in their graces; but no more of that. It shall be my\\n    business hereafter to live the life of an honest man, and to act as\\n    becomes the master of a family. I question not but I shall draw upon\\n    me the raillery of the town, and be treated to the tune of \"The\\n    Marriage-hater Matched;\" but I am prepared for it. I have been as\\n    witty as others in my time. To tell thee truly, I saw such a tribe of\\n    fashionable young fluttering coxcombs shot up that I do not think my\\n    post of an _homme de ruelle_ any longer tenable. I felt a certain\\n    stiffness in my limbs which entirely destroyed the jauntiness of air I\\n    was once master of. Besides, for I must now confess my age to thee, I\\n    have been eight-and-forty above these twelve years. Since my\\n    retirement into the country will make a vacancy in the Club, I could\\n    wish that you would fill up my place with my friend Tom Dapperwit. He\\n    has an infinite deal of fire, and knows the town. For my own part, as\\n    I have said before, I shall endeavour to live hereafter suitable to a\\n    man in my station, as a prudent head of a family, a good husband, a\\n    careful father (when it shall so happen), and as\\n\\n      \"Your most sincere friend and humble servant,\\n        \"WILLIAM HONEYCOMB.\"[93]\\n\\nI have already alluded to the delight with which the fancy of Addison\\nplayed round the caprices of female attire. The following--an extract from\\nthe paper on the \"fair sex\" which specially roused the spleen of Swift--is\\na good specimen of his style when in this vein:\\n\\n    \"To return to our female heads. The ladies have been for some time in\\n    a kind of moulting season with regard to that part of their dress,\\n    having cast great quantities of ribbon, lace, and cambric, and in some\\n    measure reduced that part of the human figure to the beautiful\\n    globular form which is natural to it. We have for a great while\\n    expected what kind of ornament would be substituted in the place of\\n    those antiquated commodes. But our female projectors were all the last\\n    summer so taken up with the improvement of their petticoats that they\\n    had not time to attend to anything else; but having at length\\n    sufficiently adorned their lower parts, they now begin to turn their\\n    thoughts upon the other extremity, as well remembering the old kitchen\\n    proverb, \\'that if you light your fire at both ends, the middle will\\n    shift for itself.\\'\"[94]\\n\\nAddison may be said to have almost created and wholly perfected English\\nprose as an instrument for the expression of _social_ thought. Prose had\\nof course been written in many different manners before his time. Bacon,\\nCowley, and Temple had composed essays; Hooker, Sir Thomas Browne, Hobbes,\\nand Locke philosophical treatises; Milton controversial pamphlets; Dryden\\ncritical prefaces; Raleigh and Clarendon histories; Taylor, Barrow, South,\\nand Tillotson sermons. But it cannot be said that any of these had founded\\na prose style which, besides being a reflection of the mind of the writer,\\ncould be taken as representing the genius and character of the nation.\\nThey write as if they were thinking apart from their audience, or as if\\nthey were speaking to it either from an inferior or superior position. The\\nessayists had taken as their model Montaigne, and their style is therefore\\nstamped, so to speak, with the character of soliloquy; the preachers, who\\nperhaps did more than any writers to guide the genius of the language,\\nnaturally addressed their hearers with the authority of their office;\\nMilton, even in controversy, rises from the natural sublimity of his mind\\nto heights of eloquence to which the ordinary idioms of society could not\\nhave borne him; while Dryden, using the language with a raciness and\\nrhythm probably unequalled in our literature, nevertheless exhibits in his\\nprefaces an air of deference towards the various patrons he addresses.\\nMoreover, many of the earlier prose writers had aimed at standards of\\ndiction which were inconsistent with the genius of the English tongue.\\nBacon, for instance, disfigures his style with the witty antitheses which\\nfound favour with the Elizabethan and early Stuart writers; Hooker,\\nMilton, and Browne construct their sentences on a Latin model, which,\\nthough it often gives a certain dignity of manner, prevents anything like\\nease, simplicity, and lucidity of expression. Thus Hooker delights in\\ninversions; both he and Milton protract their periods by the insertion of\\nmany subordinate clauses; and Browne \"projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia\\nverba\" till the Saxon element seems almost eliminated from his style.\\n\\nAddison took features of his style from almost all his predecessors: he\\nassumes the characters of essayist, moralist, philosopher, and critic, but\\nhe blends them all together in his new capacity of journalist. He had\\naccepted the public as his judges; and he writes as if some critical\\nrepresentative of the public were at his elbow, putting to the test of\\nreason every sentiment and every expression. Warton tells us, in his\\n_Essay on Pope_, that Addison was so fastidious in composition that he\\nwould often stop the press to alter a preposition or conjunction; and this\\nevidence is corroborated in a very curious and interesting manner by the\\nMS. of some of Addison\\'s essays, discovered by Mr. Dykes Campbell in\\n1858.[95] A sentence in one of the papers on the _Pleasures of the\\nImagination_ shows, by the various stages through which it passed before\\nits form seemed satisfactory to the writer, what nice attention he gave to\\nthe balance, rhythm, and lucidity of his periods. In its original shape\\nthe sentence was written thus:\\n\\n    \"For this reason we find the poets always crying up a Country Life;\\n    where Nature is left to herself, and appears to y{e} best advantage.\"\\n\\nThis is rather bald, and the MS. is accordingly corrected as follows:\\n\\n    \"For this reason we find all Fancifull men, and y{e} poets in\\n    particular, still in love with a Country Life; where Nature is left to\\n    herself, and furnishes out all y{e} variety of Scenes y{t} are most\\n    delightful to y{e} Imagination.\"\\n\\nThe text as it stands is this:\\n\\n    \"For this reason we always find the poet in love with a country life,\\n    where nature appears in the greatest perfection, and furnishes out all\\n    those scenes that are most apt to delight the imagination.\"[96]\\n\\nThis is certainly the best, both in point of sense and sound. Addison\\nperceived that there was a certain contradiction in the idea of Nature\\nbeing \"left to herself,\" and at the same time _furnishing_ scenes for the\\npleasure of the imagination; he therefore imparted the notion of design by\\nstriking out the former phrase and substituting \"seen in perfection;\" and\\nhe emphasised the idea by afterwards changing \"delightful\" into the\\nstronger phrase \"apt to delight.\" The improvement of the rhythm of the\\nsentence in its final form is obvious.\\n\\nWith so much elaboration of style it is natural that there should be in\\nAddison\\'s essays a disappearance of that egotism which is a\\ncharacteristic--and a charming one--of Montaigne; his moralising is\\nnatural, for the age required it, but is free from the censoriousness of\\nthe preacher; his critical and philosophical papers all assume an\\nintelligence in his reader equal to his own.\\n\\nThis perfection of breeding in writing is an art which vanishes with the\\n_Tatler_ and _Spectator_. Other critics, other humourists have made their\\nmark in English literature, but no second Addison has appeared. Johnson\\ntook him for his model so far as to convey lessons of morality to the\\npublic by means of periodical essays. But he confesses that he addressed\\nhis audience in tones of \"dictatorial instruction;\" and any one who\\ncompares the ponderous sententiousness and the elaborate antithesis of the\\n_Rambler_ with the light and rhythmical periods of the _Spectator_ will\\nperceive that the spirit of preaching is gaining ground on the genius of\\nconversation. Charles Lamb, again, has passages which, for mere delicacy\\nof humour, are equal to anything in Addison\\'s writings. But the\\nsuperiority of Addison consists in this, that he expresses the humour of\\nthe life about him, while Lamb is driven to look at its oddities from\\noutside. He is not, like Addison, a moralist or a satirist; the latter\\nindeed performed his task so thoroughly that the turbulent license of\\nMohocks, Tityre Tus, and such like brotherhoods, gradually disappeared\\nbefore the advance of a tame and orderly public opinion. To Lamb, looking\\nback on the primitive stages of society from a safe distance, vice itself\\nseemed pardonable because picturesque, much in the same way as travellers\\nbegan to admire the loneliness and the grandeur of nature when they were\\nrelieved from apprehensions for the safety of their purses and their\\nnecks. His humour is that of a sentimentalist; it dwells on odd nooks and\\ncorners, and describes quaint survivals in men and things. For our own\\nage, when all that is picturesque in society is being levelled by a dull\\nutilitarianism, this vein of eccentric imagination has a special charm,\\nbut the taste is likely to be a transient one. Mrs. Battle will amuse so\\nlong as this generation remembers the ways of its grandmothers: two\\ngenerations hence the point of its humour will probably be lost. But the\\nfigure of Sir Roger de Coverley, though it belongs to a bygone stage of\\nsociety, is as durable as human nature itself, and, while the language\\nlasts, the exquisite beauty of the colours in which it is preserved will\\nexcite the same kind of pleasure. Scarcely below the portrait of the good\\nknight will be ranked the character of his friend and biographer, the\\nsilent Spectator of men. A grateful posterity, remembering what it owes to\\nhim, will continue to assign him the reputation he coveted: \"It was said\\nof Socrates that he brought Philosophy down from heaven to inhabit among\\nmen; and I shall be ambitious to have it said of me that I have brought\\nPhilosophy out of closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell at\\nclubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and in coffee-houses.\"\\n\\n\\nTHE END.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n[1] _Spectator_, No. 108.\\n\\n[2] _Spectator_, No. 158.\\n\\n[3] _Spectator_, No. 341.\\n\\n[4] _Spectator_, No. 65.\\n\\n[5] _Tatler_, No. 25.\\n\\n[6] A note in the edition of Johnson\\'s _Lives of the Poets_, published in\\n1801, states, on the authority of a \"Lady in Wiltshire,\" who derived her\\ninformation from a Mr. Stephens, a Fellow of Magdalen and a contemporary\\nof Addison\\'s, that the Henry Sacheverell to whom Addison dedicated his\\n_Account of the Greatest English Poets_ was not the well-known divine, but\\na personal friend of Addison\\'s, who died young, having written a _History\\nof the Isle of Man_.\\n\\n[7] _Spence\\'s Anecdotes_, p. 50.\\n\\n[8] Compare the _Notes on the Metamorphoses_, Fab. v.

Loomings.\\nCall me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely\\n—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to\\ninterest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see\\nthe watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the\\nspleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself\\ngrowing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly\\nNovember in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing\\nbefore coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I\\nmeet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of\\nme, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from\\ndeliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking\\npeople’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon\\nas I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a\\nphilosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly\\ntake to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew\\nit, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very\\nnearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by\\nwharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with\\nher surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme\\ndowntown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by\\nwaves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out\\nof sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from\\nCorlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall,\\nnorthward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around\\nthe town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in\\nocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon\\nthe pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China;\\nsome high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better\\nseaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in\\nlath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to\\ndesks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they\\nhere?\\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water,\\nand seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them\\nbut the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of\\nyonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh\\nthe water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they\\nstand—miles of them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes\\nand alleys, streets and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet\\nhere they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles\\nof the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?\\nOnce more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of\\nlakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you\\ndown in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There\\nis magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his\\ndeepest reveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going,\\nand he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that\\nregion. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try\\nthis experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a\\nmetaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and\\nwater are wedded for ever.\\nBut here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest,\\nshadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all\\nthe valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There\\nstand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a\\ncrucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep\\nhis cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep\\ninto distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping\\nspurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the\\npicture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its\\nsighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless\\nthe shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.\\nGo visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you\\nwade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm\\nwanting?—Water—there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara\\nbut a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see\\nit? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving\\ntwo handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which\\nhe sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to\\nRockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a\\nrobust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to\\nsea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself\\nfeel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship\\nwere now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the\\nsea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own\\nbrother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still\\ndeeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he\\ncould not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain,\\nplunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we\\nourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the\\nungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I\\nbegin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious\\nof my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea\\nas a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a\\npurse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.\\nBesides, passengers get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of\\nnights—do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;—no, I\\nnever go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I\\never go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon\\nthe glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For\\nmy part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and\\ntribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do\\nto take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs,\\nschooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,—though I\\nconfess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of\\nofficer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;\\n—though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically\\nsalted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more\\nrespectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is\\nout of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis\\nand roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those\\ncreatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the\\nmast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-\\nhead. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump\\nfrom spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first,\\nthis sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of\\nhonor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the\\nland, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more\\nthan all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you\\nhave been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest\\nboys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you,\\nfrom a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of\\nSeneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even\\nthis wears off in time.\\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a\\nbroom and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity\\namount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament?\\nDo you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me,\\nbecause I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that\\nparticular instance? Who ain’t a slave? Tell me that. Well, then,\\nhowever the old sea-captains may order me about—however they\\nmay thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing\\nthat it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in\\nmuch the same way—either in a physical or metaphysical point of\\nview, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all\\nhands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades, and be content.\\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of\\npaying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a\\nsingle penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers\\nthemselves must pay. And there is all the difference in the world\\nbetween paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the\\nmost uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed\\nupon us. But being paid,—what will compare with it? The urbane\\nactivity with which a man receives money is really marvellous,\\nconsidering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all\\nearthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.\\nAh! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!\\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\\nexercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,\\nhead winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if\\nyou never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the\\nCommodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second\\nhand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it\\nfirst; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead\\ntheir leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders\\nlittle suspect it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly\\nsmelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my\\nhead to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of\\nthe Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly\\ndogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way—he can\\nbetter answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this\\nwhaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence\\nthat was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief\\ninterlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it\\nthat this part of the bill must have run something like this:\\n“Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States.\\n“WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN\\nAFFGHANISTAN.”\\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage\\nmanagers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling\\nvoyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high\\ntragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly\\nparts in farces—though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now\\nthat I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the\\nsprings and motives which being cunningly presented to me under\\nvarious disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I\\ndid, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice\\nresulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating\\njudgment.\\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the\\ngreat whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster\\nroused all my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he\\nrolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the\\nwhale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand\\nPatagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With\\nother men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements;\\nbut as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things\\nremote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts.\\nNot ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and\\ncould still be social with it—would they let me—since it is but well\\nto be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges\\nin.\\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome;\\nthe great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the\\nwild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there\\nfloated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and,\\nmid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill\\nin the air.\\nCHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.\\nI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my\\narm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good\\ncity of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a\\nSaturday night in December. Much was I disappointed upon learning\\nthat the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no\\nway of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.\\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling\\nstop at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage,\\nit may as well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.\\nFor my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket\\ncraft, because there was a fine, boisterous something about\\neverything connected with that famous old island, which amazingly\\npleased me. Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually\\nmonopolising the business of whaling, and though in this matter\\npoor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her\\ngreat original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the first\\ndead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket\\ndid those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in\\ncanoes to give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from\\nNantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth,\\npartly laden with imported cobblestones—so goes the story—to\\nthrow at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh\\nenough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?\\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night following\\nbefore me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port,\\nit became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep\\nmeanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and\\ndismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the place.\\nWith anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought\\nup a few pieces of silver,—So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to\\nmyself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my\\nbag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness\\ntowards the south—wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to\\nlodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price,\\nand don’t be too particular.\\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of\\n“The Crossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly\\nthere. Further on, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish\\nInn,” there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted\\nthe packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere\\nelse the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic\\npavement,—rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the\\nflinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles\\nof my boots were in a most miserable plight. Too expensive and\\njolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare\\nin the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within. But\\ngo on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t you hear? get away from before\\nthe door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I went. I\\nnow by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for\\nthere, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.\\nSuch dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either\\nhand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a\\ntomb. At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that\\nquarter of the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to\\na smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of\\nwhich stood invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were\\nmeant for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did\\nwas to stumble over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as\\nthe flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that\\ndestroyed city, Gomorrah? But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The\\nSword-Fish?”—this, then must needs be the sign of “The Trap.”\\nHowever, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within,\\npushed on and opened a second, interior door.\\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred\\nblack faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black\\nAngel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro\\nchurch; and the preacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness,\\nand the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael,\\nmuttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The\\nTrap!’\\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the\\ndocks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a\\nswinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly\\nrepresenting a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words\\nunderneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”\\nCoffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion,\\nthought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I\\nsuppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light\\nlooked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough,\\nand the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might\\nhave been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as\\nthe swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I\\nthought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the\\nbest of pea coffee.\\nIt was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side\\npalsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak\\ncorner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse\\nhowling than ever it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon,\\nnevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with\\nhis feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that\\ntempestuous wind called Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose\\nworks I possess the only copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous\\ndifference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window\\nwhere the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it\\nfrom that sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of\\nwhich the wight Death is the only glazier.” True enough, thought I,\\nas this passage occurred to my mind—old black-letter, thou\\nreasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine\\nis the house. What a pity they didn’t stop up the chinks and the\\ncrannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it’s too\\nlate to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the\\ncopestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago.\\nPoor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his\\npillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug\\nup both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet\\nthat would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon!\\nsays old Dives, in his red silken wrapper—(he had a redder one\\nafterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters;\\nwhat northern lights! Let them talk of their oriental summer climes\\nof everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of making my\\nown summer with my own coals.\\nBut what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding\\nthem up to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be\\nin Sumatra than here? Would he not far rather lay him down\\nlengthwise along the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to\\nthe fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost?\\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone\\nbefore the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an\\niceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives\\nhimself, he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen\\nsighs, and being a president of a temperance society, he only drinks\\nthe tepid tears of orphans.\\nBut no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and\\nthere is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our\\nfrosted feet, and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be.\\nCHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.\\nEntering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a\\nwide, low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding\\none of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side\\nhung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every\\nway defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it,\\nit was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it,\\nand careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive\\nat an understanding of its purpose. Such unaccountable masses of\\nshades and shadows, that at first you almost thought some\\nambitious young artist, in the time of the New England hags, had\\nendeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of much and\\nearnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially\\nby throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry,\\nyou at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild,\\nmight not be altogether unwarranted.\\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,\\nportentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the\\npicture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a\\nnameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to\\ndrive a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,\\nhalf-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to\\nit, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what\\nthat marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,\\ndeceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s the Black Sea in a\\nmidnight gale.—It’s the unnatural combat of the four primal\\nelements.—It’s a blasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean winter scene.—\\nIt’s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time. But at last all\\nthese fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the\\npicture’s midst. That once found out, and all the rest were plain. But\\nstop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even\\nthe great leviathan himself?\\nIn fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\\npartly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons\\nwith whom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a\\nCape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering\\nthere with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an\\nexasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in\\nthe enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.\\nThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a\\nheathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly\\nset with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted\\nwith knots of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast\\nhandle sweeping round like the segment made in the new-mown\\ngrass by a long-armed mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and\\nwondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have\\ngone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement.\\nMixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all\\nbroken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once\\nlong lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill\\nfifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon—\\nso like a corkscrew now—was flung in Javan seas, and run away\\nwith by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The\\noriginal iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle\\nsojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last\\nwas found imbedded in the hump.\\nCrossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way—\\ncut through what in old times must have been a great central\\nchimney with fireplaces all round—you enter the public room. A still\\nduskier place is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and\\nsuch old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you\\ntrod some old craft’s cockpits, especially of such a howling night,\\nwhen this corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously. On one side\\nstood a long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases,\\nfilled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world’s remotest\\nnooks. Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-\\nlooking den—the bar—a rude attempt at a right whale’s head. Be\\nthat how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale’s\\njaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive beneath it. Within are\\nshabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and\\nin those jaws of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by\\nwhich name indeed they called him), bustles a little withered old\\nman, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and\\ndeath.\\nAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison.\\nThough true cylinders without—within, the villanous green goggling\\nglasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel\\nmeridians rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads’\\ngoblets. Fill to this mark, and your charge is but a penny; to this a\\npenny more; and so on to the full glass—the Cape Horn measure,\\nwhich you may gulp down for a shilling.\\nUpon entering the place I found a number of young seamen\\ngathered about a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens\\nof skrimshander. I sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to\\nbe accommodated with a room, received for answer that his house\\nwas full—not a bed unoccupied. “But avast,” he added, tapping his\\nforehead, “you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer’s\\nblanket, have ye? I s’pose you are goin’ a-whalin’, so you’d better\\nget used to that sort of thing.”\\nI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should\\never do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be,\\nand that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and\\nthe harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than\\nwander further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would\\nput up with the half of any decent man’s blanket.\\n“I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want supper?\\nSupper’ll be ready directly.”\\nI sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench\\non the Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further\\nadorning it with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working\\naway at the space between his legs. He was trying his hand at a\\nship under full sail, but he didn’t make much headway, I thought.\\nAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\\nadjoining room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—the landlord\\nsaid he couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles,\\neach in a winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey\\njackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half\\nfrozen fingers. But the fare was of the most substantial kind—not\\nonly meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings\\nfor supper! One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed\\nhimself to these dumplings in a most direful manner.\\n“My boy,” said the landlord, “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead\\nsartainty.”\\n“Landlord,” I whispered, “that aint the harpooneer is it?”\\n“Oh, no,” said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, “the\\nharpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings,\\nhe don’t—he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes ’em rare.”\\n“The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that harpooneer? Is he\\nhere?”\\n“He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer.\\nI could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this “dark\\ncomplexioned” harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if\\nit so turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and\\nget into bed before I did.\\nSupper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when,\\nknowing not what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the\\nrest of the evening as a looker on.\\nPresently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the\\nlandlord cried, “That’s the Grampus’s crew. I seed her reported in\\nthe offing this morning; a three years’ voyage, and a full ship.\\nHurrah, boys; now we’ll have the latest news from the Feegees.”\\nA tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was\\nflung open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped\\nin their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen\\ncomforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with\\nicicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had\\njust landed from their boat, and this was the first house they\\nentered. No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the\\nwhale’s mouth—the bar—when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there\\nofficiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round. One\\ncomplained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him\\na pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a\\nsovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of\\nhow long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or\\non the weather side of an ice-island.\\nThe liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does\\neven with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they\\nbegan capering about most obstreperously.\\nI observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and\\nthough he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates\\nby his own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from\\nmaking as much noise as the rest. This man interested me at once;\\nand since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become\\nmy shipmate (though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this\\nnarrative is concerned), I will here venture upon a little description\\nof him. He stood full six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a\\nchest like a coffer-dam. I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.\\nHis face was deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth\\ndazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes\\nfloated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.\\nHis voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his\\nfine stature, I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers\\nfrom the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his\\ncompanions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away\\nunobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade\\non the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his\\nshipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite\\nwith them, they raised a cry of “Bulkington! Bulkington! where’s\\nBulkington?” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.\\nIt was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost\\nsupernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate\\nmyself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to\\nthe entrance of the seamen.\\nNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good\\ndeal rather not sleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is,\\nbut people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it\\ncomes to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a\\nstrange town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections\\nindefinitely multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a\\nsailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors\\nno more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.\\nTo be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have\\nyour own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and\\nsleep in your own skin.\\nThe more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I\\nabominated the thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume\\nthat being a harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be,\\nwould not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to\\ntwitch all over. Besides, it was getting late, and my decent\\nharpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards. Suppose now,\\nhe should tumble in upon me at midnight—how could I tell from\\nwhat vile hole he had been coming?\\n“Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan’t\\nsleep with him. I’ll try the bench here.”\\n“Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a\\nmattress, and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots\\nand notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s\\nplane there in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make ye snug enough.”\\nSo saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief\\nfirst dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,\\nthe while grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at\\nlast the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The\\nlandlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s\\nsake to quit—the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not\\nknow how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a\\npine plank. So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and\\nthrowing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he\\nwent about his business, and left me in a brown study.\\nI now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a\\nfoot too short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a\\nfoot too narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four\\ninches higher than the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I\\nthen placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space\\nagainst the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to\\nsettle down in. But I soon found that there came such a draught of\\ncold air over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan\\nwould never do at all, especially as another current from the rickety\\ndoor met the one from the window, and both together formed a\\nseries of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot\\nwhere I had thought to spend the night.\\nThe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn’t I\\nsteal a march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed,\\nnot to be wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no\\nbad idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could\\ntell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the\\nroom, the harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to\\nknock me down!\\nStill, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\\nspending a sufferable night unless in some other person’s bed, I\\nbegan to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable\\nprejudices against this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile;\\nhe must be dropping in before long. I’ll have a good look at him\\nthen, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all—\\nthere’s no telling.\\nBut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and\\nthrees, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\\n“Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always\\nkeep such late hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock.\\nThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to\\nbe mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,”\\nhe answered, “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley\\nto rise—yes, he’s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he\\nwent out a peddling, you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps\\nhim so late, unless, may be, he can’t sell his head.”\\n“Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this\\nyou are telling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend\\nto say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this\\nblessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his\\nhead around this town?”\\n“That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t\\nsell it here, the market’s overstocked.”\\n“With what?” shouted I.\\n“With heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads in the world?”\\n“I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you’d better\\nstop spinning that yarn to me—I’m not green.”\\n“May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I\\nrayther guess you’ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you\\na slanderin’ his head.”\\n“I’ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at this\\nunaccountable farrago of the landlord’s.\\n“It’s broke a’ready,” said he.\\n“Broke,” said I—“broke, do you mean?”\\n“Sartain, and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it, I guess.”\\n“Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snow-\\nstorm—“landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one\\nanother, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want\\na bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other\\nhalf belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer,\\nwhom I have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most\\nmystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an\\nuncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my\\nbedfellow—a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and\\nconfidential one in the highest degree. I now demand of you to\\nspeak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and\\nwhether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him.\\nAnd in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that story\\nabout selling his head, which if true I take to be good evidence that\\nthis harpooneer is stark mad, and I’ve no idea of sleeping with a\\nmadman; and you, sir, you I mean, landlord, you, sir, by trying to\\ninduce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable\\nto a criminal prosecution.”\\n“Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty\\nlong sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy,\\nbe easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just\\narrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of ’balmed\\nNew Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he’s sold all on\\n’em but one, and that one he’s trying to sell to-night, cause to-\\nmorrow’s Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin’ human heads\\nabout the streets when folks is goin’ to churches. He wanted to, last\\nSunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin’ out of the door with\\nfour heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.”\\nThis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery,\\nand showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling\\nme—but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who\\nstayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged\\nin such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\\n“Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”\\n“He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting\\ndreadful late, you had better be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal\\nand me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There’s\\nplenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it’s an almighty\\nbig bed that. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and\\nlittle Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling\\nabout one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and\\ncame near breaking his arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldn’t do.\\nCome along here, I’ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;” and so saying he\\nlighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.\\nBut I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he\\nexclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that harpooneer to-\\nnight; he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then; do come;\\nwon’t ye come?”\\nI considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went,\\nand I was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished,\\nsure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for\\nany four harpooneers to sleep abreast.\\n“There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea\\nchest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there,\\nmake yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned\\nround from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\\nFolding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though\\nnone of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I\\nthen glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre\\ntable, could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a\\nrude shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a\\nman striking a whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room,\\nthere was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one\\ncorner; also a large seaman’s bag, containing the harpooneer’s\\nwardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a\\nparcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place,\\nand a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\\nBut what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the\\nlight, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive\\nat some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to\\nnothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little\\ntinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an\\nIndian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat,\\nas you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be\\npossible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and\\nparade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put\\nit on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being\\nuncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as\\nthough this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy\\nday. I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I\\nnever saw such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a\\nhurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\\nI sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking\\nabout this head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After\\nthinking some time on the bed-side, I got up and took off my\\nmonkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of the room thinking. I\\nthen took off my coat, and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.\\nBut beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was, and\\nremembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer’s not\\ncoming home at all that night, it being so very late, I made no more\\nado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing\\nout the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care\\nof heaven.\\nWhether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken\\ncrockery, there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and\\ncould not sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze,\\nand had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod,\\nwhen I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of\\nlight come into the room from under the door.\\nLord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\\nhead-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word\\ntill spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\\nZealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and\\nwithout looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off\\nfrom me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away\\nat the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in\\nthe room. I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted\\nfor some time while employed in unlacing the bag’s mouth. This\\naccomplished, however, he turned round—when, good heavens!\\nwhat a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour,\\nhere and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares. Yes,\\nit’s just as I thought, he’s a terrible bedfellow; he’s been in a fight,\\ngot dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But at that\\nmoment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I\\nplainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black\\nsquares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At\\nfirst I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the\\ntruth occurred to me. I remembered a story of a white man—a\\nwhaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had been\\ntattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of\\nhis distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And\\nwhat is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his outside; a man can be\\nhonest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly\\ncomplexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and\\ncompletely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it\\nmight be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never\\nheard of a hot sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.\\nHowever, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun\\nthere produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now,\\nwhile all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this\\nharpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty having\\nopened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled\\nout a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on.\\nPlacing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then\\ntook the New Zealand head—a ghastly thing enough—and\\ncrammed it down into the bag. He now took off his hat—a new\\nbeaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. There\\nwas no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a\\nsmall scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head\\nnow looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the\\nstranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out\\nof it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.\\nEven as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the\\nwindow, but it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what\\nto make of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my\\ncomprehension. Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being\\ncompletely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I\\nconfess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil\\nhimself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night. In\\nfact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to\\naddress him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what\\nseemed inexplicable in him.\\nMeanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last\\nshowed his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him\\nwere checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was\\nall over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty\\nYears’ War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still\\nmore, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs\\nwere running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain\\nthat he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard\\nof a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian\\ncountry. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps\\nthe heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—\\nheavens! look at that tomahawk!\\nBut there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went\\nabout something that completely fascinated my attention, and\\nconvinced me that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his\\nheavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously\\nhung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length\\na curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, and\\nexactly the colour of a three days’ old Congo baby. Remembering\\nthe embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black manikin\\nwas a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that it\\nwas not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished\\nebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol,\\nwhich indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the\\nempty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this\\nlittle hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The\\nchimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I\\nthought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or\\nchapel for his Congo idol.\\nI now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image,\\nfeeling but ill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow.\\nFirst he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego\\npocket, and places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit\\nof ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he\\nkindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many\\nhasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his\\nfingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last\\nsucceeded in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and\\nashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro. But the\\nlittle devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he\\nnever moved his lips. All these strange antics were accompanied by\\nstill stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be\\npraying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or\\nother, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural\\nmanner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very\\nunceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as\\ncarelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\\nAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and\\nseeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his\\nbusiness operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was\\nhigh time, now or never, before the light was put out, to break the\\nspell in which I had so long been bound.\\nBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal\\none. Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head\\nof it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth\\nat the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The\\nnext moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal,\\ntomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I\\ncould not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment\\nhe began feeling me.\\nStammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from\\nhim against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever\\nhe might be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp\\nagain. But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill\\ncomprehended my meaning.\\n“Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I\\nkill-e.” And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about\\nme in the dark.\\n“Landlord, for God’s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord!\\nWatch! Coffin! Angels! save me!”\\n“Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again\\ngrowled the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk\\nscattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen\\nwould get on fire. But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord\\ncame into the room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran\\nup to him.\\n“Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here\\nwouldn’t harm a hair of your head.”\\n“Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn’t you tell me that\\nthat infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”\\n“I thought ye know’d it;—didn’t I tell ye, he was a peddlin’ heads\\naround town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg,\\nlook here—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you—\\nyou sabbee?”\\n“Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe\\nand sitting up in bed.\\n“You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk,\\nand throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only\\na civil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a\\nmoment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\\nlooking cannibal. What’s all this fuss I have been making about,\\nthought I to myself—the man’s a human being just as I am: he has\\njust as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better\\nsleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\\n“Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe,\\nor whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will\\nturn in with him. But I don’t fancy having a man smoking in bed\\nwith me. It’s dangerous. Besides, I ain’t insured.”\\nThis being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again\\npolitely motioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as\\nmuch as to say—“I won’t touch a leg of ye.”\\n“Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”\\nI turned in, and never slept better in my life.\\nCHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.\\nUpon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s\\narm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.\\nYou had almost thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was\\nof patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles;\\nand this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan\\nlabyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise\\nshade—owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea\\nunmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled\\nup at various times—this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the\\nworld like a strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly lying\\non it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from\\nthe quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by\\nthe sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg\\nwas hugging me.\\nMy sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I\\nwas a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that\\nbefell me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely\\nsettle. The circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper\\nor other—I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had\\nseen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,\\nsomehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to\\nbed supperless,—my mother dragged me by the legs out of the\\nchimney and packed me off to bed, though it was only two o’clock\\nin the afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our\\nhemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But there was no help for it, so up\\nstairs I went to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as\\nslowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got\\nbetween the sheets.\\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must\\nelapse before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed!\\nthe small of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too;\\nthe sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in\\nthe streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt\\nworse and worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down\\nin my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly\\nthrew myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to\\ngive me a good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed\\nbut condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of\\ntime. But she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers,\\nand back I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay there\\nbroad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done\\nsince, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I must\\nhave fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking\\nfrom it—half steeped in dreams—I opened my eyes, and the before\\nsun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a\\nshock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and\\nnothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in\\nmine. My arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless,\\nunimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged,\\nseemed closely seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled\\non ages, I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to\\ndrag away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one\\nsingle inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I knew not how this\\nconsciousness at last glided away from me; but waking in the\\nmorning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for days and weeks\\nand months afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to\\nexplain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often puzzle myself\\nwith it.\\nNow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\\nsupernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\\nthose which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’s\\npagan arm thrown round me. But at length all the past night’s\\nevents soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay\\nonly alive to the comical predicament. For though I tried to move\\nhis arm—unlock his bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he\\nstill hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us\\ntwain. I now strove to rouse him—“Queequeg!”—but his only\\nanswer was a snore. I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were\\nin a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch. Throwing aside\\nthe counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage’s\\nside, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A pretty pickle, truly,\\nthought I; abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a\\ncannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the name of goodness,\\nQueequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud\\nand incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\\nhugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded\\nin extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook\\nhimself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and\\nsat up in bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his\\neyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there,\\nthough a dim consciousness of knowing something about me\\nseemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing\\nhim, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly\\nobserving so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed\\nmade up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as\\nit were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by\\ncertain signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased\\nme, he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards,\\nleaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under\\nthe circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is,\\nthese savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it\\nis marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this particular\\ncompliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\\ncivility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\\nstaring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions;\\nfor the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding.\\nNevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and\\nhis ways were well worth unusual regarding.\\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very\\ntall one, by the by, and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted\\nup his boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but\\nhis next movement was to crush himself—boots in hand, and hat on\\n—under the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings,\\nI inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of\\npropriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private\\nwhen putting on his boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a\\ncreature in the transition stage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He\\nwas just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the\\nstrangest possible manners. His education was not yet completed.\\nHe was an undergraduate. If he had not been a small degree\\ncivilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with\\nboots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage, he never\\nwould have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\\nlast, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down\\nover his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as\\nif, not being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled\\ncowhide ones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched\\nand tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\\nSeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that\\nthe street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a\\nplain view into the room, and observing more and more the\\nindecorous figure that Queequeg made, staving about with little\\nelse but his hat and boots on; I begged him as well as I could, to\\naccelerate his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his\\npantaloons as soon as possible. He complied, and then proceeded\\nto wash himself. At that time in the morning any Christian would\\nhave washed his face; but Queequeg, to my amazement, contented\\nhimself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.\\nHe then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap\\non the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and\\ncommenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept\\nhis razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed\\ncorner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets\\nit a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the\\nwall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.\\nThinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers’s best cutlery with a\\nvengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I\\ncame to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made,\\nand how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.\\nThe rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched\\nout of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and\\nsporting his harpoon like a marshal’s baton.\\nCHAPTER 5. Breakfast.\\nI quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room\\naccosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice\\ntowards him, though he had been skylarking with me not a little in\\nthe matter of my bedfellow.\\nHowever, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too\\nscarce a good thing; the more’s the pity. So, if any one man, in his\\nown proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him\\nnot be backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and\\nbe spent in that way. And the man that has anything bountifully\\nlaughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than you\\nperhaps think for.\\nThe bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been\\ndropping in the night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a\\ngood look at. They were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and\\nsecond mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea\\ncoopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a\\nbrown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy\\nset, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.\\nYou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore.\\nThis young fellow’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue,\\nand would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been\\nthree days landed from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks\\na few shades lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him.\\nIn the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly\\nbleached withal; he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But\\nwho could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various\\ntints, seemed like the Andes’ western slope, to show forth in one\\narray, contrasting climates, zone by zone.\\n“Grub, ho!” now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in\\nwe went to breakfast.\\nThey say that men who have seen the world, thereby become\\nquite at ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not\\nalways, though: Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and\\nMungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men, they possessed the least\\nassurance in the parlor. But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in\\na sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary\\nwalk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of Africa, which was\\nthe sum of poor Mungo’s performances—this kind of travel, I say,\\nmay not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish.\\nStill, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had anywhere.\\nThese reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance\\nthat after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to\\nhear some good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise,\\nnearly every man maintained a profound silence. And not only that,\\nbut they looked embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs,\\nmany of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great\\nwhales on the high seas—entire strangers to them—and duelled\\nthem dead without winking; and yet, here they sat at a social\\nbreakfast table—all of the same calling, all of kindred tastes—\\nlooking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never\\nbeen out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains.\\nA curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior whalemen!\\nBut as for Queequeg—why, Queequeg sat there among them—at\\nthe head of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be\\nsure I cannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could\\nnot have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast\\nwith him, and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the\\ntable with it, to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and\\ngrappling the beefsteaks towards him. But that was certainly very\\ncoolly done by him, and every one knows that in most people’s\\nestimation, to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly.\\nWe will not speak of all Queequeg’s peculiarities here; how he\\neschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention\\nto beefsteaks, done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he\\nwithdrew like the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-\\npipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his\\ninseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll.\\nCHAPTER 6. The Street.\\nIf I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so\\noutlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite\\nsociety of a civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon\\ntaking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.\\nIn thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will\\nfrequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from\\nforeign parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean\\nmariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is\\nnot unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo\\nGreen, live Yankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford\\nbeats all Water Street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts\\nyou see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand\\nchatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry\\non their bones unholy flesh. It makes a stranger stare.\\nBut, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans,\\nPannangians, and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of\\nthe whaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you will\\nsee other sights still more curious, certainly more comical. There\\nweekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New\\nHampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery. They are\\nmostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled forests,\\nand now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance. Many\\nare as green as the Green Mountains whence they came. In some\\nthings you would think them but a few hours old. Look there! that\\nchap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and\\nswallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife. Here\\ncomes another with a sou’-wester and a bombazine cloak.\\nNo town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one—I\\nmean a downright bumpkin dandy—a fellow that, in the dog-days,\\nwill mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his\\nhands. Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to\\nmake a distinguished reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery,\\nyou should see the comical things he does upon reaching the\\nseaport. In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his\\nwaistcoats; straps to his canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how\\nbitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale, when thou\\nart driven, straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.\\nBut think not that this famous town has only harpooneers,\\ncannibals, and bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New\\nBedford is a queer place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that\\ntract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling\\ncondition as the coast of Labrador. As it is, parts of her back country\\nare enough to frighten one, they look so bony. The town itself is\\nperhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New England. It is a land\\nof oil, true enough: but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and\\nwine. The streets do not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do\\nthey pave them with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all\\nAmerica will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens\\nmore opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they? how\\nplanted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?\\nGo and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder\\nlofty mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these\\nbrave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific,\\nand Indian oceans. One and all, they were harpooned and dragged\\nup hither from the bottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a\\nfeat like that?\\nIn New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their\\ndaughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.\\nYou must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they\\nsay, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night\\nrecklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.\\nIn summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples—\\nlong avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the\\nbeautiful and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the\\npasser-by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So\\nomnipotent is art; which in many a district of New Bedford has\\nsuperinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse\\nrocks thrown aside at creation’s final day.\\nAnd the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red\\nroses. But roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation\\nof their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens.\\nElsewhere match that bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem,\\nwhere they tell me the young girls breathe such musk, their sailor\\nsweethearts smell them miles off shore, as though they were\\ndrawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.\\nCHAPTER 7. The Chapel.\\nIn this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman’s Chapel, and\\nfew are the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean\\nor Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that\\nI did not.\\nReturning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon\\nthis special errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to\\ndriving sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the\\ncloth called bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm.\\nEntering, I found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and\\nsailors’ wives and widows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at\\ntimes by the shrieks of the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed\\npurposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were\\ninsular and incommunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived; and\\nthere these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing\\nseveral marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on\\neither side the pulpit. Three of them ran something like the\\nfollowing, but I do not pretend to quote:—\\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of\\neighteen, was lost overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off\\nPatagonia, November 1st, 1836. THIS TABLET Is erected to his\\nMemory BY HIS SISTER.\\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY,\\nNATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL\\nGLEIG, Forming one of the boats’ crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who\\nwere towed out of sight by a Whale, On the Off-shore Ground in\\nthe PACIFIC, December 31st, 1839. THIS MARBLE Is here placed by\\ntheir surviving SHIPMATES.\\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY,\\nWho in the bows of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the\\ncoast of Japan, August 3d, 1833. THIS TABLET Is erected to his\\nMemory BY HIS WIDOW.\\nShaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated\\nmyself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see\\nQueequeg near me. Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there\\nwas a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance.\\nThis savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my\\nentrance; because he was the only one who could not read, and,\\ntherefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall.\\nWhether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared\\nthere were now among the congregation, I knew not; but so many\\nare the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did\\nseveral women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of\\nsome unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me were\\nassembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak\\ntablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.\\nOh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who\\nstanding among flowers can say—here, here lies my beloved; ye\\nknow not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these. What\\nbitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes!\\nWhat despair in those immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids\\nand unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all\\nFaith, and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly\\nperished without a grave. As well might those tablets stand in the\\ncave of Elephanta as here.\\nIn what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are\\nincluded; why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they\\ntell no tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin\\nSands; how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the\\nother world, we prefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet do\\nnot thus entitle him, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of\\nthis living earth; why the Life Insurance Companies pay death-\\nforfeitures upon immortals; in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and\\ndeadly, hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round\\ncenturies ago; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for\\nthose who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable\\nbliss; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but\\nthe rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city. All these\\nthings are not without their meanings.\\nBut Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from\\nthese dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.\\nIt needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a\\nNantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the\\nmurky light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the\\nwhalemen who had gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate\\nmay be thine. But somehow I grew merry again. Delightful\\ninducements to embark, fine chance for promotion, it seems—aye, a\\nstove boat will make me an immortal by brevet. Yes, there is death\\nin this business of whaling—a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling\\nof a man into Eternity. But what then? Methinks we have hugely\\nmistaken this matter of Life and Death. Methinks that what they call\\nmy shadow here on earth is my true substance. Methinks that in\\nlooking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing\\nthe sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the\\nthinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being.\\nIn fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me. And\\ntherefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and\\nstove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.\\nCHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.\\nI had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable\\nrobustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back\\nupon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the\\ncongregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the\\nchaplain. Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the\\nwhalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite. He had\\nbeen a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years\\npast had dedicated his life to the ministry. At the time I now write\\nof, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that\\nsort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth,\\nfor among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild\\ngleams of a newly developing bloom—the spring verdure peeping\\nforth even beneath February’s snow. No one having previously\\nheard his history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple\\nwithout the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted\\nclerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous\\nmaritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that he\\ncarried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for\\nhis tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot\\ncloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight\\nof the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes\\nwere one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an\\nadjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly\\napproached the pulpit.\\nLike most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since\\na regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\\nfloor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\\narchitect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\\nfinished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side\\nladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The\\nwife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome\\npair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself\\nnicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole\\ncontrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by\\nno means in bad taste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the\\nladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the\\nman-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a\\ntruly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand,\\nmounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\\nThe perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\\nwith swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds\\nwere of wood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my first\\nglimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however\\nconvenient for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed\\nunnecessary. For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after\\ngaining the height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit,\\ndeliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was\\ndeposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec.\\nI pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason\\nfor this. Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity\\nand sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by\\nany mere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some\\nsober reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize\\nsomething unseen. Can it be, then, that by that act of physical\\nisolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all\\noutward worldly ties and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the\\nmeat and wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I\\nsee, is a self-containing stronghold—a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a\\nperennial well of water within the walls.\\nBut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\\nborrowed from the chaplain’s former sea-farings. Between the\\nmarble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which\\nformed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a\\ngallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black\\nrocks and snowy breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-\\nrolling clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which\\nbeamed forth an angel’s face; and this bright face shed a distinct\\nspot of radiance upon the ship’s tossed deck, something like that\\nsilver plate now inserted into the Victory’s plank where Nelson fell.\\n“Ah, noble ship,” the angel seemed to say, “beat on, beat on, thou\\nnoble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking\\nthrough; the clouds are rolling off—serenest azure is at hand.”\\nNor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste\\nthat had achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was\\nin the likeness of a ship’s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\\nprojecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship’s fiddle-\\nheaded beak.\\nWhat could be more full of meaning?—for the pulpit is ever this\\nearth’s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads\\nthe world. From thence it is the storm of God’s quick wrath is first\\ndescried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it\\nis the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable\\nwinds. Yes, the world’s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage\\ncomplete; and the pulpit is its prow.\\nCHAPTER 9. The Sermon.\\nFather Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority\\nordered the scattered people to condense. “Starboard gangway,\\nthere! side away to larboard—larboard gangway to starboard!\\nMidships! midships!”\\nThere was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the\\nbenches, and a still slighter shuffling of women’s shoes, and all was\\nquiet again, and every eye on the preacher.\\nHe paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit’s bows, folded his\\nlarge brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and\\noffered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and\\npraying at the bottom of the sea.\\nThis ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling\\nof a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog—in such tones\\nhe commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his\\nmanner towards the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing\\nexultation and joy—\\n     “The ribs and terrors in the whale,\\n     Arched over me a dismal gloom,\\n     While all God’s sun-lit waves rolled by,\\n     And lift me deepening down to doom.\\n     “I saw the opening maw of hell,\\n     With endless pains and sorrows there;\\n     Which none but they that feel can tell—\\n     Oh, I was plunging to despair.\\n     “In black distress, I called my God,\\n     When I could scarce believe him mine,\\n     He bowed his ear to my complaints—\\n     No more the whale did me confine.\\n     “With speed he flew to my relief,\\n     As on a radiant dolphin borne;\\n     Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone\\n     The face of my Deliverer God.\\n     “My song for ever shall record\\n     That terrible, that joyful hour;\\n     I give the glory to my God,\\n     His all the mercy and the power.”\\n \\nNearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above\\nthe howling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly\\nturned over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand\\ndown upon the proper page, said: “Beloved shipmates, clinch the\\nlast verse of the first chapter of Jonah—‘And God had prepared a\\ngreat fish to swallow up Jonah.’”\\n“Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters—four yarns\\n—is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the\\nScriptures. Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah’s deep sealine\\nsound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble\\nthing is that canticle in the fish’s belly! How billow-like and\\nboisterously grand! We feel the floods surging over us; we sound\\nwith him to the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the\\nslime of the sea is about us! But what is this lesson that the book of\\nJonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us\\nall as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God. As\\nsinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin,\\nhard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment,\\nrepentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As\\nwith all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in his\\nwilful disobedience of the command of God—never mind now what\\nthat command was, or how conveyed—which he found a hard\\ncommand. But all the things that God would have us do are hard\\nfor us to do—remember that—and hence, he oftener commands us\\nthan endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we must disobey\\nourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the\\nhardness of obeying God consists.\\n“With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at\\nGod, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by\\nmen will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but\\nonly the Captains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of\\nJoppa, and seeks a ship that’s bound for Tarshish. There lurks,\\nperhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all accounts\\nTarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz.\\nThat’s the opinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates?\\nCadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could\\npossibly have sailed in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an\\nalmost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is\\non the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and\\nTarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward\\nfrom that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not then,\\nshipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?\\nMiserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with\\nslouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among\\nthe shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So\\ndisordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been\\npolicemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something\\nwrong, had been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a\\nfugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,—no\\nfriends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after\\nmuch dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last\\nitems of her cargo; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in\\nthe cabin, all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the\\ngoods, to mark the stranger’s evil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain\\nhe tries to look all ease and confidence; in vain essays his wretched\\nsmile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be\\nno innocent. In their gamesome but still serious way, one whispers\\nto the other—“Jack, he’s robbed a widow;” or, “Joe, do you mark\\nhim; he’s a bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, I guess he’s the adulterer that\\nbroke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers\\nfrom Sodom.” Another runs to read the bill that’s stuck against the\\nspile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five\\nhundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and\\ncontaining a description of his person. He reads, and looks from\\nJonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd\\nround Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah\\ntrembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so\\nmuch the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but\\nthat itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when\\nthe sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let\\nhim pass, and he descends into the cabin.\\n“‘Who’s there?’ cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly\\nmaking out his papers for the Customs—‘Who’s there?’ Oh! how\\nthat harmless question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost\\nturns to flee again. But he rallies. ‘I seek a passage in this ship to\\nTarshish; how soon sail ye, sir?’ Thus far the busy Captain had not\\nlooked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no\\nsooner does he hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing\\nglance. ‘We sail with the next coming tide,’ at last he slowly\\nanswered, still intently eyeing him. ‘No sooner, sir?’—‘Soon enough\\nfor any honest man that goes a passenger.’ Ha! Jonah, that’s another\\nstab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. ‘I’ll sail\\nwith ye,’—he says,—‘the passage money how much is that?—I’ll pay\\nnow.’ For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not\\nto be overlooked in this history, ‘that he paid the fare thereof’ ere\\nthe craft did sail. And taken with the context, this is full of meaning.\\n“Now Jonah’s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment\\ndetects crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the\\npenniless. In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel\\nfreely, and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is\\nstopped at all frontiers. So Jonah’s Captain prepares to test the\\nlength of Jonah’s purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him\\nthrice the usual sum; and it’s assented to. Then the Captain knows\\nthat Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a\\nflight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out\\nhis purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain. He rings every\\ncoin to find a counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and\\nJonah is put down for his passage. ‘Point out my state-room, Sir,’\\nsays Jonah now, ‘I’m travel-weary; I need sleep.’ ‘Thou lookest like it,’\\nsays the Captain, ‘there’s thy room.’ Jonah enters, and would lock\\nthe door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly\\nfumbling there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters\\nsomething about the doors of convicts’ cells being never allowed to\\nbe locked within. All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws\\nhimself into his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost\\nresting on his forehead. The air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in\\nthat contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship’s water-line, Jonah\\nfeels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the\\nwhale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels’ wards.\\n“Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly\\noscillates in Jonah’s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the\\nwharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and\\nall, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity\\nwith reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself,\\nit but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it hung. The\\nlamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented\\neyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds\\nno refuge for his restless glance. But that contradiction in the lamp\\nmore and more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are\\nall awry. ‘Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!’ he groans, ‘straight\\nupwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my soul are all in\\ncrookedness!’\\n“Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still\\nreeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of\\nthe Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags\\ninto him; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in\\ngiddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed;\\nand at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over\\nhim, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the\\nwound, and there’s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in\\nhis berth, Jonah’s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning\\ndown to sleep.\\n“And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables;\\nand from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all\\ncareening, glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of\\nrecorded smugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels;\\nhe will not bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the\\nship is like to break. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to\\nlighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard;\\nwhen the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every\\nplank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah’s head; in all\\nthis raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black\\nsky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he\\nor heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with\\nopen mouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah\\nwas gone down into the sides of the ship—a berth in the cabin as I\\nhave taken it, and was fast asleep. But the frightened master comes\\nto him, and shrieks in his dead ear, ‘What meanest thou, O, sleeper!\\narise!’ Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers\\nto his feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out\\nupon the sea. But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther\\nbillow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps into\\nthe ship, and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till\\nthe mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat. And ever, as\\nthe white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in\\nthe blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit\\npointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the\\ntormented deep.\\n“Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his\\ncringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The\\nsailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of\\nhim, and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter\\nto high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this\\ngreat tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah’s; that discovered,\\nthen how furiously they mob him with their questions. ‘What is\\nthine occupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What\\npeople? But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah.\\nThe eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from;\\nwhereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions, but\\nlikewise another answer to a question not put by them, but the\\nunsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God\\nthat is upon him.\\n“‘I am a Hebrew,’ he cries—and then—‘I fear the Lord the God of\\nHeaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!’ Fear him, O\\nJonah? Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God then! Straightway,\\nhe now goes on to make a full confession; whereupon the mariners\\nbecame more and more appalled, but still are pitiful. For when\\nJonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well\\nknew the darkness of his deserts,—when wretched Jonah cries out\\nto them to take him and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew\\nthat for his sake this great tempest was upon them; they mercifully\\nturn from him, and seek by other means to save the ship. But all in\\nvain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand raised\\ninvokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of\\nJonah.\\n“And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into\\nthe sea; when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east,\\nand the sea is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving\\nsmooth water behind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a\\nmasterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he\\ndrops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale\\nshoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his\\nprison. Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish’s belly. But\\nobserve his prayer, and learn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is,\\nJonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance. He feels that\\nhis dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his deliverance to God,\\ncontenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he\\nwill still look towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true\\nand faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for\\npunishment. And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is\\nshown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the\\nwhale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for\\nhis sin but I do place him before you as a model for repentance. Sin\\nnot; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah.”\\nWhile he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,\\nslanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher,\\nwho, when describing Jonah’s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm\\nhimself. His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed\\narms seemed the warring elements at work; and the thunders that\\nrolled away from off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from\\nhis eye, made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear\\nthat was strange to them.\\nThere now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the\\nleaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless,\\nwith closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God\\nand himself.\\nBut again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his\\nhead lowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he\\nspake these words:\\n“Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands\\npress upon me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine\\nthe lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and\\nstill more to me, for I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how\\ngladly would I come down from this mast-head and sit on the\\nhatches there where you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one\\nof you reads me that other and more awful lesson which Jonah\\nteaches to me, as a pilot of the living God. How being an anointed\\npilot-prophet, or speaker of true things, and bidden by the Lord to\\nsound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh,\\nJonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from his\\nmission, and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship\\nat Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we\\nhave seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him\\ndown to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him\\nalong ‘into the midst of the seas,’ where the eddying depths sucked\\nhim ten thousand fathoms down, and ‘the weeds were wrapped\\nabout his head,’ and all the watery world of woe bowled over him.\\nYet even then beyond the reach of any plummet—‘out of the belly\\nof hell’—when the whale grounded upon the ocean’s utmost bones,\\neven then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he\\ncried. Then God spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold\\nand blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up towards the\\nwarm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth; and\\n‘vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;’ when the word of the Lord\\ncame a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten—his ears, like\\ntwo sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean—Jonah\\ndid the Almighty’s bidding. And what was that, shipmates? To\\npreach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!\\n“This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of\\nthe living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms\\nfrom Gospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the\\nwaters when God has brewed them into a gale! Woe to him who\\nseeks to please rather than to appal! Woe to him whose good name\\nis more to him than goodness! Woe to him who, in this world,\\ncourts not dishonor! Woe to him who would not be true, even\\nthough to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him who, as the\\ngreat Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others is himself a\\ncastaway!”\\nHe dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting\\nhis face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried\\nout with a heavenly enthusiasm,—“But oh! shipmates! on the\\nstarboard hand of every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the\\ntop of that delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the\\nmain-truck higher than the kelson is low? Delight is to him—a far,\\nfar upward, and inward delight—who against the proud gods and\\ncommodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self.\\nDelight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship\\nof this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him. Delight\\nis to him, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and\\ndestroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of\\nSenators and Judges. Delight,—top-gallant delight is to him, who\\nacknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a\\npatriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the\\nbillows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this\\nsure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness will be\\nhis, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath—O\\nFather!—chiefly known to me by Thy rod—mortal or immortal, here\\nI die. I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world’s, or\\nmine own. Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is\\nman that he should live out the lifetime of his God?”\\nHe said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his\\nface with his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people\\nhad departed, and he was left alone in the place.\\nCHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend.\\nReturning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg\\nthere quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction\\nsome time. He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet\\non the stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his\\nface that little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with\\na jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming\\nto himself in his heathenish way.\\nBut being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon,\\ngoing to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his\\nlap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every\\nfiftieth page—as I fancied—stopping a moment, looking vacantly\\naround him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle\\nof astonishment. He would then begin again at the next fifty;\\nseeming to commence at number one each time, as though he\\ncould not count more than fifty, and it was only by such a large\\nnumber of fifties being found together, that his astonishment at the\\nmultitude of pages was excited.\\nWith much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was,\\nand hideously marred about the face—at least to my taste—his\\ncountenance yet had a something in it which was by no means\\ndisagreeable. You cannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly\\ntattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and\\nin his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of\\na spirit that would dare a thousand devils. And besides all this, there\\nwas a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his\\nuncouthness could not altogether maim. He looked like a man who\\nhad never cringed and never had had a creditor. Whether it was,\\ntoo, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer\\nand brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise\\nwould, this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head\\nwas phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it\\nreminded me of General Washington’s head, as seen in the popular\\nbusts of him. It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope\\nfrom above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two\\nlong promontories thickly wooded on top. Queequeg was George\\nWashington cannibalistically developed.\\nWhilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile\\nto be looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded\\nmy presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single\\nglance; but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of\\nthe marvellous book. Considering how sociably we had been\\nsleeping together the night previous, and especially considering the\\naffectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the\\nmorning, I thought this indifference of his very strange. But savages\\nare strange beings; at times you do not know exactly how to take\\nthem. At first they are overawing; their calm self-collectedness of\\nsimplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had noticed also that\\nQueequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the other\\nseamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to\\nhave no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this\\nstruck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was\\nsomething almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty\\nthousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is—which\\nwas the only way he could get there—thrown among people as\\nstrange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he\\nseemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity; content\\nwith his own companionship; always equal to himself. Surely this\\nwas a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never\\nheard there was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be true\\nphilosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so\\nstriving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out\\nfor a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he\\nmust have “broken his digester.”\\nAs I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in\\nthat mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it\\nthen only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms\\ngathering round the casements, and peering in upon us silent,\\nsolitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn swells; I began\\nto be sensible of strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more\\nmy splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the\\nwolfish world. This soothing savage had redeemed it. There he sat,\\nhis very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no\\ncivilized hypocrisies and bland deceits. Wild he was; a very sight of\\nsights to see; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards\\nhim. And those same things that would have repelled most others,\\nthey were the very magnets that thus drew me. I’ll try a pagan\\nfriend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow\\ncourtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs\\nand hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At first he\\nlittle noticed these advances; but presently, upon my referring to his\\nlast night’s hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were\\nagain to be bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked\\npleased, perhaps a little complimented.\\nWe then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to\\nexplain to him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the\\nfew pictures that were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and\\nfrom that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various\\nouter sights to be seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a\\nsocial smoke; and, producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly\\noffered me a puff. And then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild\\npipe of his, and keeping it regularly passing between us.\\nIf there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the\\nPagan’s breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it\\nout, and left us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally\\nand unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he\\npressed his forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and\\nsaid that henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country’s\\nphrase, that we were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if\\nneed should be. In a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship\\nwould have seemed far too premature, a thing to be much\\ndistrusted; but in this simple savage those old rules would not\\napply.\\nAfter supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our\\nroom together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took\\nout his enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco,\\ndrew out some thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the\\ntable, and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions,\\npushed one of them towards me, and said it was mine. I was going\\nto remonstrate; but he silenced me by pouring them into my\\ntrowsers’ pockets. I let them stay. He then went about his evening\\nprayers, took out his idol, and removed the paper fireboard. By\\ncertain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for me to\\njoin him; but well knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a\\nmoment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or\\notherwise.\\nI was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the\\ninfallible Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild\\nidolator in worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship?\\nthought I. Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous\\nGod of heaven and earth—pagans and all included—can possibly\\nbe jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But\\nwhat is worship?—to do the will of God—that is worship. And what\\nis the will of God?—to do to my fellow man what I would have my\\nfellow man to do to me—that is the will of God. Now, Queequeg is\\nmy fellow man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to\\nme? Why, unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of\\nworship. Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I\\nmust turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the\\ninnocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg;\\nsalamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done,\\nwe undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences\\nand all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little\\nchat.\\nHow it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for\\nconfidential disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say,\\nthere open the very bottom of their souls to each other; and some\\nold couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning.\\nThus, then, in our hearts’ honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg—a cosy,\\nloving pair.\\nCHAPTER 11. Nightgown.\\nWe had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals,\\nand Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown\\ntattooed legs over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely\\nsociable and free and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our\\nconfabulations, what little nappishness remained in us altogether\\ndeparted, and we felt like getting up again, though day-break was\\nyet some way down the future.\\nYes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent\\nposition began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found\\nourselves sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning\\nagainst the head-board with our four knees drawn up close\\ntogether, and our two noses bending over them, as if our kneepans\\nwere warming-pans. We felt very nice and snug, the more so since\\nit was so chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing\\nthat there was no fire in the room. The more so, I say, because truly\\nto enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for\\nthere is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by\\ncontrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are\\nall over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you\\ncannot be said to be comfortable any more. But if, like Queequeg\\nand me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown of your head\\nbe slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general consciousness\\nyou feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For this reason a\\nsleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is\\none of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height of this\\nsort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between\\nyou and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there you\\nlie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.\\nWe had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time,\\nwhen all at once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between\\nsheets, whether by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I\\nhave a way of always keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to\\nconcentrate the snugness of being in bed. Because no man can ever\\nfeel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed; as if darkness\\nwere indeed the proper element of our essences, though light be\\nmore congenial to our clayey part. Upon opening my eyes then, and\\ncoming out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the\\nimposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-\\no’clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did I at\\nall object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to\\nstrike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he\\nfelt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be\\nit said, that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his\\nsmoking in the bed the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff\\nprejudices grow when love once comes to bend them. For now I\\nliked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me, even\\nin bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy\\nthen. I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord’s policy of\\ninsurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential\\ncomfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.\\nWith our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed\\nthe Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us\\na blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the\\nnew-lit lamp.\\nWhether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away\\nto far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native\\nisland; and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and\\ntell it. He gladly complied. Though at the time I but ill\\ncomprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent disclosures,\\nwhen I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology, now\\nenable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the\\nmere skeleton I give.\\nCHAPTER 12. Biographical.\\nQueequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the\\nWest and South. It is not down in any map; true places never are.\\nWhen a new-hatched savage running wild about his native\\nwoodlands in a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he\\nwere a green sapling; even then, in Queequeg’s ambitious soul,\\nlurked a strong desire to see something more of Christendom than\\na specimen whaler or two. His father was a High Chief, a King; his\\nuncle a High Priest; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who\\nwere the wives of unconquerable warriors. There was excellent\\nblood in his veins—royal stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the\\ncannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth.\\nA Sag Harbor ship visited his father’s bay, and Queequeg sought\\na passage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full\\ncomplement of seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his\\nfather’s influence could prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone\\nin his canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the\\nship must pass through when she quitted the island. On one side\\nwas a coral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with\\nmangrove thickets that grew out into the water. Hiding his canoe,\\nstill afloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down\\nin the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding by,\\nlike a flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash\\nof his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and\\nthrowing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt\\nthere, and swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.\\nIn vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended\\na cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King,\\nand Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness,\\nand his wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented,\\nand told him he might make himself at home. But this fine young\\nsavage—this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain’s cabin.\\nThey put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of\\nhim. But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign\\ncities, Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he\\nmight happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored\\ncountrymen. For at bottom—so he told me—he was actuated by a\\nprofound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to\\nmake his people still happier than they were; and more than that,\\nstill better than they were. But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon\\nconvinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and\\nwicked; infinitely more so, than all his father’s heathens. Arrived at\\nlast in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and\\nthen going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages\\nin that place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for lost. Thought he,\\nit’s a wicked world in all meridians; I’ll die a pagan.\\nAnd thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these\\nChristians, wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence\\nthe queer ways about him, though now some time from home.\\nBy hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and\\nhaving a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead\\nand gone, he being very old and feeble at the last accounts. He\\nanswered no, not yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or\\nrather Christians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and\\nundefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him. But by and by,\\nhe said, he would return,—as soon as he felt himself baptized again.\\nFor the nonce, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild\\noats in all four oceans. They had made a harpooneer of him, and\\nthat barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.\\nI asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his\\nfuture movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old\\nvocation. Upon this, I told him that whaling was my own design,\\nand informed him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being\\nthe most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark\\nfrom. He at once resolved to accompany me to that island, ship\\naboard the same vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat,\\nthe same mess with me, in short to share my every hap; with both\\nmy hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds. To all\\nthis I joyously assented; for besides the affection I now felt for\\nQueequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could\\nnot fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly\\nignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with\\nthe sea, as known to merchant seamen.\\nHis story being ended with his pipe’s last dying puff, Queequeg\\nembraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out\\nthe light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and\\nvery soon were sleeping.\\nCHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.\\nNext morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to\\na barber, for a block, I settled my own and comrade’s bill; using,\\nhowever, my comrade’s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the\\nboarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which\\nhad sprung up between me and Queequeg—especially as Peter\\nCoffin’s cock and bull stories about him had previously so much\\nalarmed me concerning the very person whom I now companied\\nwith.\\nWe borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including\\nmy own poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg’s canvas sack and\\nhammock, away we went down to “the Moss,” the little Nantucket\\npacket schooner moored at the wharf. As we were going along the\\npeople stared; not at Queequeg so much—for they were used to\\nseeing cannibals like him in their streets,—but at seeing him and me\\nupon such confidential terms. But we heeded them not, going along\\nwheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now and then\\nstopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked him\\nwhy he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and\\nwhether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this,\\nin substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough,\\nyet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it\\nwas of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply\\nintimate with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers\\nand mowers, who go into the farmers’ meadows armed with their\\nown scythes—though in no wise obliged to furnish them—even so,\\nQueequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.\\nShifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny\\nstory about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag\\nHarbor. The owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which\\nto carry his heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem\\nignorant about the thing—though in truth he was entirely so,\\nconcerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow—\\nQueequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and then shoulders\\nthe barrow and marches up the wharf. “Why,” said I, “Queequeg, you\\nmight have known better than that, one would think. Didn’t the\\npeople laugh?”\\nUpon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of\\nRokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant\\nwater of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a\\npunchbowl; and this punchbowl always forms the great central\\nornament on the braided mat where the feast is held. Now a certain\\ngrand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its\\ncommander—from \\nall \\naccounts, \\na \\nvery \\nstately \\npunctilious\\ngentleman, at least for a sea captain—this commander was invited\\nto the wedding feast of Queequeg’s sister, a pretty young princess\\njust turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding guests were\\nassembled at the bride’s bamboo cottage, this Captain marches in,\\nand being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over against\\nthe punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the\\nKing, Queequeg’s father. Grace being said,—for those people have\\ntheir grace as well as we—though Queequeg told me that unlike us,\\nwho at such times look downwards to our platters, they, on the\\ncontrary, copying the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all\\nfeasts—Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet\\nby the immemorial ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his\\nconsecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the\\nblessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest,\\nand noting the ceremony, and thinking himself—being Captain of a\\nship—as having plain precedence over a mere island King, especially\\nin the King’s own house—the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his\\nhands in the punchbowl;—taking it I suppose for a huge finger-\\nglass. “Now,” said Queequeg, “what you tink now?—Didn’t our\\npeople laugh?”\\nAt last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the\\nschooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one\\nside, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees\\nall glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks\\non casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the world-\\nwandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while\\nfrom others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended\\nnoises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new\\ncruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage\\nended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a\\nthird, and so on, for ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea,\\nthe intolerableness of all earthly effort.\\nGaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the\\nlittle Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his\\nsnortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!—how I spurned that\\nturnpike earth!—that common highway all over dented with the\\nmarks of slavish heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the\\nmagnanimity of the sea which will permit no records.\\nAt the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel\\nwith me. His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and\\npointed teeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did\\nhomage to the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before\\nthe Sultan. Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn\\ntingling like a wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in\\nland tornadoes. So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood\\nby the plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the\\njeering glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who\\nmarvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable; as\\nthough a white man were anything more dignified than a\\nwhitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins\\nthere, who, by their intense greenness, must have come from the\\nheart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these\\nyoung saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the\\nbumpkin’s hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the\\nbrawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous\\ndexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air; then\\nslightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with\\nbursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back\\nupon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.\\n“Capting! Capting!” yelled the bumpkin, running towards that\\nofficer; “Capting, Capting, here’s the devil.”\\n“Hallo, you sir,” cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking\\nup to Queequeg, “what in thunder do you mean by that? Don’t you\\nknow you might have killed that chap?”\\n“What him say?” said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\\n“He say,” said I, “that you came near kill-e that man there,”\\npointing to the still shivering greenhorn.\\n“Kill-e,” cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an\\nunearthly expression of disdain, “ah! him bevy small-e fish-e;\\nQueequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!”\\n“Look you,” roared the Captain, “I’ll kill-e you, you cannibal, if you\\ntry any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.”\\nBut it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain\\nto mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had\\nparted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now\\nflying from side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of\\nthe deck. The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly,\\nwas swept overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt\\nsnatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness. It flew from\\nright to left, and back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and\\nevery instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.\\nNothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done;\\nthose on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the\\nboom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the\\nmidst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees,\\nand crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope,\\nsecured one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a\\nlasso, caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at\\nthe next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The\\nschooner was run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing\\naway the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from\\nthe side with a long living arc of a leap. For three minutes or more\\nhe was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his long arms straight\\nout before him, and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders\\nthrough the freezing foam. I looked at the grand and glorious\\nfellow, but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down.\\nShooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now\\ntook an instant’s glance around him, and seeming to see just how\\nmatters were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes more,\\nand he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other\\ndragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor\\nbumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump;\\nthe captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg\\nlike a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.\\nWas there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think\\nthat he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and\\nMagnanimous Societies. He only asked for water—fresh water—\\nsomething to wipe the brine off; that done, he put on dry clothes,\\nlighted his pipe, and leaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing\\nthose around him, seemed to be saying to himself—“It’s a mutual,\\njoint-stock world, in all meridians. We cannibals must help these\\nChristians.”\\nCHAPTER 14. Nantucket.\\nNothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning;\\nso, after a fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.\\nNantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real\\ncorner of the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore,\\nmore lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it—a mere\\nhillock, and elbow of sand; all beach, without a background. There is\\nmore sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute\\nfor blotting paper. Some gamesome wights will tell you that they\\nhave to plant weeds there, they don’t grow naturally; that they\\nimport Canada thistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a\\nspile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket\\nare carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome; that people\\nthere plant toadstools before their houses, to get under the shade\\nin summer time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three\\nblades in a day’s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes,\\nsomething like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,\\nbelted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter\\nisland of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small\\nclams will sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea\\nturtles. But these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no\\nIllinois.\\nLook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was\\nsettled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an\\neagle swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off\\nan infant Indian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw\\ntheir child borne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to\\nfollow in the same direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a\\nperilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found\\nan empty ivory casket,—the poor little Indian’s skeleton.\\nWhat wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach,\\nshould take to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and\\nquohogs in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for\\nmackerel; more experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured\\ncod; and at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea,\\nexplored \\nthis \\nwatery \\nworld; \\nput \\nan \\nincessant \\nbelt \\nof\\ncircumnavigations round it; peeped in at Behring’s Straits; and in all\\nseasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest\\nanimated mass that has survived the flood; most monstrous and\\nmost mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon, clothed\\nwith such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics\\nare more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious\\nassaults!\\nAnd thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits,\\nissuing from their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the\\nwatery world like so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them\\nthe Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers\\ndid Poland. Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon\\nCanada; let the English overswarm all India, and hang out their\\nblazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe\\nare the Nantucketer’s. For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors\\nown empires; other seamen having but a right of way through it.\\nMerchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating\\nforts; even pirates and privateers, though following the sea as\\nhighwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other\\nfragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their\\nliving from the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone\\nresides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down\\nto it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.\\nThere is his home; there lies his business, which a Noah’s flood\\nwould not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in\\nChina. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides\\namong the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the\\nAlps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it\\nat last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon\\nwould to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds\\nher wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the\\nNantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his\\nrest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.\\nCHAPTER 15. Chowder.\\nIt was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly\\nto anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to\\nno business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The\\nlandlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin\\nHosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the\\nproprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and\\nmoreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him,\\nwas famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we\\ncould not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But\\nthe directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse\\non our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the\\nlarboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a\\ncorner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the\\nfirst man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of\\nhis very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset,\\nQueequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of\\ndeparture—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had\\nunderstood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by\\ndint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then\\nknocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last\\ncame to something which there was no mistaking.\\nTwo enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by\\nasses’ ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted\\nin front of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed\\noff on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little\\nlike a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at\\nthe time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague\\nmisgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two\\nremaining horns; yes, two of them, one for Queequeg, and one for\\nme. It’s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in\\nmy first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen’s\\nchapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too!\\nAre these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?\\nI was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled\\nwoman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch\\nof the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much\\nlike an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a\\npurple woollen shirt.\\n“Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I’ll be combing ye!”\\n“Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There’s Mrs. Hussey.”\\nAnd so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but\\nleaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs.\\nUpon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs.\\nHussey, postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into\\na little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a\\nrecently concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or\\nCod?”\\n“What’s that about Cods, ma’am?” said I, with much politeness.\\n“Clam or Cod?” she repeated.\\n“A clam for supper? a cold clam; is that what you mean, Mrs.\\nHussey?” says I, “but that’s a rather cold and clammy reception in\\nthe winter time, ain’t it, Mrs. Hussey?”\\nBut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the\\npurple Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to\\nhear nothing but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an\\nopen door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,”\\ndisappeared.\\n“Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper\\nfor us both on one clam?”\\nHowever, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie\\nthe apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking\\nchowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet\\nfriends! hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely\\nbigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted\\npork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and\\nplentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being\\nsharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing\\nhis favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being\\nsurpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when\\nleaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey’s clam\\nand cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment.\\nStepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great\\nemphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury\\nsteam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good\\ntime a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.\\nWe resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl,\\nthinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the\\nhead? What’s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people?\\n“But look, Queequeg, ain’t that a live eel in your bowl? Where’s your\\nharpoon?”\\nFishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its\\nname; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for\\nbreakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you\\nbegan to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area\\nbefore the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a\\npolished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his\\naccount books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy\\nflavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one\\nmorning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some\\nfishermen’s boats, I saw Hosea’s brindled cow feeding on fish\\nremnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod’s\\ndecapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.\\nSupper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs.\\nHussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was\\nabout to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm,\\nand demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her\\nchambers. “Why not?” said I; “every true whaleman sleeps with his\\nharpoon—but why not?” “Because it’s dangerous,” says she. “Ever\\nsince young Stiggs coming from that unfort’nt v’y’ge of his, when he\\nwas gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of ile, was\\nfound dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever\\nsince then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in\\ntheir rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg” (for she had learned his\\nname), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till\\nmorning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast,\\nmen?”\\n“Both,” says I; “and let’s have a couple of smoked herring by way\\nof variety.”\\nCHAPTER 16. The Ship.\\nIn bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise\\nand no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that\\nhe had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little\\ngod—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly\\ninsisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among\\nthe whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft;\\ninstead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of\\nthe ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed\\nbefriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a\\nvessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon,\\nfor all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that\\nvessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of\\nQueequeg.\\nI have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg\\nplaced great confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and\\nsurprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable\\nesteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well\\nenough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his\\nbenevolent designs.\\nNow, this plan of Queequeg’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the\\nselection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little\\nrelied upon Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted\\nto carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances\\nproduced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce;\\nand accordingly prepared to set about this business with a\\ndetermined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly\\nsettle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg\\nshut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was\\nsome sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and\\nprayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; how it was I never could\\nfind out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never\\ncould master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg,\\nthen, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his\\nsacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After\\nmuch prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt\\nthat there were three ships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-\\ndam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. Devil-Dam, I do not know the\\norigin of; Tit-bit is obvious; Pequod, you will no doubt remember,\\nwas the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now\\nextinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-\\ndam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on\\nboard the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then\\ndecided that this was the very ship for us.\\nYou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\\nknow;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-\\nbox galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw\\nsuch a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship\\nof the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned\\nclaw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in\\nthe typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull’s complexion\\nwas darkened like a French grenadier’s, who has alike fought in\\nEgypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—\\ncut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were\\nlost overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines\\nof the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and\\nwrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury\\nCathedral where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities,\\nwere added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild\\nbusiness that for more than half a century she had followed. Old\\nCaptain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded\\nanother vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of\\nthe principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term\\nof his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness,\\nand inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\\nunmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake’s carved buckler\\nor bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian\\nemperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a\\nthing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the\\nchased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open\\nbulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long\\nsharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten\\nher old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not\\nthrough base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves\\nof sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she\\nsported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously\\ncarved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The\\nhelmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar,\\nwhen he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble\\ncraft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched\\nwith that.\\nNow when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\\nauthority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage,\\nat first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of\\ntent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It\\nseemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical\\nshape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of\\nlimber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the\\njaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck,\\na circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each\\nother, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose\\nhairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old\\nPottowottamie Sachem’s head. A triangular opening faced towards\\nthe bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete\\nview forward.\\nAnd half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one\\nwho by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being\\nnoon, and the ship’s work suspended, was now enjoying respite\\nfrom the burden of command. He was seated on an old-fashioned\\noaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom\\nof which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff\\nof which the wigwam was constructed.\\nThere was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the\\nappearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like\\nmost old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in\\nthe Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-\\nwork of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must\\nhave arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and\\nalways looking to windward;—for this causes the muscles about the\\neyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very\\neffectual in a scowl.\\n“Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door\\nof the tent.\\n“Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want\\nof him?” he demanded.\\n“I was thinking of shipping.”\\n“Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been\\nin a stove boat?”\\n“No, Sir, I never have.”\\n“Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?\\n“Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I’ve been\\nseveral voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”\\n“Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see\\nthat leg?—I’ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest\\nof the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I\\nsuppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those\\nmarchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a\\nwhaling, eh?—it looks a little suspicious, don’t it, eh?—Hast not\\nbeen a pirate, hast thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst\\nthou?—Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest\\nto sea?”\\nI protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the\\nmask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an\\ninsulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices,\\nand rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod\\nor the Vineyard.\\n“But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I\\nthink of shipping ye.”\\n“Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”\\n“Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on\\nCaptain Ahab?”\\n“Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”\\n“Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”\\n“I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain\\nhimself.”\\n“Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that’s who ye are speaking\\nto, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the\\nPequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs,\\nincluding crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going\\nto say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye\\ndo, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to\\nit, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and\\nthou wilt find that he has only one leg.”\\n“What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”\\n“Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was\\ndevoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty\\nthat ever chipped a boat!—ah, ah!”\\nI was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched\\nat the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly\\nas I could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how\\ncould I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale,\\nthough indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact\\nof the accident.”\\n“Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d’ye see;\\nthou dost not talk shark a bit. Sure, ye’ve been to sea before now;\\nsure of that?”\\n“Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in\\nthe merchant—”\\n“Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant\\nservice—don’t aggravate me—I won’t have it. But let us understand\\neach other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye\\nyet feel inclined for it?”\\n“I do, sir.”\\n“Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a\\nlive whale’s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”\\n“I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to\\nbe got rid of, that is; which I don’t take to be the fact.”\\n“Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling,\\nto find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in\\norder to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so.\\nWell then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the\\nweather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.”\\nFor a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not\\nknowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest.\\nBut concentrating all his crow’s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg\\nstarted me on the errand.\\nGoing forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived\\nthat the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now\\nobliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was\\nunlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the\\nslightest variety that I could see.\\n“Well, what’s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did\\nye see?”\\n“Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon\\nthough, and there’s a squall coming up, I think.”\\n“Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish\\nto go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can’t ye see the\\nworld where you stand?”\\nI was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and\\nthe Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all\\nthis I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he\\nexpressed his willingness to ship me.\\n“And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added\\n—“come along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck\\ninto the cabin.\\nSeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most\\nuncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad,\\nwho along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the\\nvessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports,\\nbeing held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children,\\nand chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head,\\nor a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket\\ninvest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do\\nyours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.\\nNow, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was\\na Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and\\nto this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon\\nmeasure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and\\nanomalously \\nmodified \\nby \\nthings \\naltogether \\nalien \\nand\\nheterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most\\nsanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting\\nQuakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.\\nSo that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\\nScripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and\\nin childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou\\nof the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\\nadventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\\nunoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\\nunworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And\\nwhen these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force,\\nwith a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the\\nstillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest\\nwaters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north,\\nbeen led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all\\nnature’s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin\\nvoluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some\\nhelp from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty\\nlanguage—that man makes one in a whole nation’s census—a\\nmighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at\\nall detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or\\nother circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling\\nmorbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great\\nare made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young\\nambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not\\nto do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man,\\nwho, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of\\nthe Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\\nLike Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired\\nwhaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what\\nare called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same\\nserious things the veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only\\nbeen originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket\\nQuakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many\\nunclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not\\nmoved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as\\naltered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was\\nthere some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain\\nBildad. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms\\nagainst land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic\\nand Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had\\nhe in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan\\ngore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious\\nBildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know;\\nbut it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had\\nlong since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man’s\\nreligion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This\\nworld pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes\\nof the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied\\nwaistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain,\\nand finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded\\nhis adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the\\ngoodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet\\nreceiving of his well-earned income.\\nNow, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\\nincorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-\\nmaster. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\\ncurious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his\\ncrew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the\\nhospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially\\nfor a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least.\\nHe never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow\\nhe got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of\\nthem. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye\\nintently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you\\ncould clutch something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to\\nwork like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence\\nand idleness perished before him. His own person was the exact\\nembodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he\\ncarried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,\\neconomical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\\nSuch, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom\\nwhen I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space\\nbetween the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad,\\nwho always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails.\\nHis broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed;\\nhis drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on\\nnose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\\n“Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been\\nstudying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\\ncertain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”\\nAs if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\\nBildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\\nand seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\\n“He says he’s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”\\n“Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to\\nme.\\n“I dost,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\\n“What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.\\n“He’ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away\\nat his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\\nI thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as\\nPeleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I\\nsaid nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open\\na chest, and drawing forth the ship’s articles, placed pen and ink\\nbefore him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it\\nwas high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing\\nto engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling\\nbusiness they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain,\\nreceived certain shares of the profits called lays, and that these lays\\nwere proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the\\nrespective duties of the ship’s company. I was also aware that being\\na green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but\\nconsidering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a\\nrope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I\\nshould be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of\\nthe clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might\\neventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call\\na rather long lay, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a\\nlucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear\\nout on it, not to speak of my three years’ beef and board, for which\\nI would not have to pay one stiver.\\nIt might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a\\nprincely fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am\\none of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am\\nquite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I\\nam putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the\\nwhole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing,\\nbut would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th,\\nconsidering I was of a broad-shouldered make.\\nBut one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful\\nabout receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I\\nhad heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable\\nold crony Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of\\nthe Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and\\nscattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship’s\\naffairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old\\nBildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands,\\nespecially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home\\nthere in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside.\\nNow while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife,\\nold Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an\\ninterested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but\\nwent on mumbling to himself out of his book, “Lay not up for\\nyourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”\\n“Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay\\nshall we give this young man?”\\n“Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred\\nand seventy-seventh wouldn’t be too much, would it?—‘where moth\\nand rust do corrupt, but lay—’”\\nLay, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\\nseventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for\\none, shall not lay up many lays here below, where moth and rust do\\ncorrupt. It was an exceedingly long lay that, indeed; and though\\nfrom the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a\\nlandsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though\\nseven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet,\\nwhen you come to make a teenth of it, you will then see, I say, that\\nthe seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good\\ndeal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons;\\nand so I thought at the time.\\n“Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to\\nswindle this young man! he must have more than that.”\\n“Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without\\nlifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your\\ntreasure is, there will your heart be also.”\\n“I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg,\\n“do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”\\nBildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him\\nsaid, “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must\\nconsider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—\\nwidows and orphans, many of them—and that if we too abundantly\\nreward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread\\nfrom those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and\\nseventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”\\n“Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\\ncabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these\\nmatters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that\\nwould be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed\\nround Cape Horn.”\\n“Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be\\ndrawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou\\nart still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\\nconscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee\\nfoundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”\\n“Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye\\ninsult me. It’s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that\\nhe’s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me,\\nand start my soul-bolts, but I’ll—I’ll—yes, I’ll swallow a live goat with\\nall his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-\\ncoloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”\\nAs he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a\\nmarvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\\nAlarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\\nresponsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up\\nall idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\\ncommanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad,\\nwho, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the\\nawakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down\\nagain on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the\\nslightest intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to\\nimpenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage\\nas he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down\\nlike a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.\\n“Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall’s gone off to leeward, I\\nthink. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend\\nthat pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That’s he;\\nthank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael’s thy name,\\ndidn’t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three\\nhundredth lay.”\\n“Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship\\ntoo—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”\\n“To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we’ll look at him.”\\n“What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the\\nbook in which he had again been burying himself.\\n“Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever\\nwhaled it any?” turning to me.\\n“Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”\\n“Well, bring him along then.”\\nAnd, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but\\nthat I had done a good morning’s work, and that the Pequod was\\nthe identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me\\nround the Cape.\\nBut I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\\nCaptain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me;\\nthough, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely\\nfitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes\\nhimself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these\\nvoyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so\\nexceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing\\nconcernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about\\nhis ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.\\nHowever, it is always as well to have a look at him before\\nirrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I\\naccosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be\\nfound.\\n“And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It’s all right enough;\\nthou art shipped.”\\n“Yes, but I should like to see him.”\\n“But I don’t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don’t know\\nexactly what’s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the\\nhouse; a sort of sick, and yet he don’t look so. In fact, he ain’t sick;\\nbut no, he isn’t well either. Any how, young man, he won’t always\\nsee me, so I don’t suppose he will thee. He’s a queer man, Captain\\nAhab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou’lt like him well\\nenough; no fear, no fear. He’s a grand, ungodly, god-like man,\\nCaptain Ahab; doesn’t speak much; but, when he does speak, then\\nyou may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab’s above the\\ncommon; Ahab’s been in colleges, as well as ’mong the cannibals;\\nbeen used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance\\nin mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest\\nand the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain’t Captain Bildad;\\nno, and he ain’t Captain Peleg; he’s Ahab, boy; and Ahab of old,\\nthou knowest, was a crowned king!”\\n“And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs,\\ndid they not lick his blood?”\\n“Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance\\nin his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on\\nboard the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not\\nname himself. ’Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed\\nmother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the\\nold squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow\\nprove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the\\nsame. I wish to warn thee. It’s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I’ve\\nsailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man\\n—not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man—\\nsomething like me—only there’s a good deal more of him. Aye, aye,\\nI know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage\\nhome, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the\\nsharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about,\\nas any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last\\nvoyage by that accursed whale, he’s been a kind of moody—\\ndesperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off.\\nAnd once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it’s\\nbetter to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one.\\nSo good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he\\nhappens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—\\nnot three voyages wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by\\nthat sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be\\nany utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted,\\nif he be, Ahab has his humanities!”\\nAs I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been\\nincidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain\\nwild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the\\ntime, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don’t know\\nwhat, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a\\nstrange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all\\ndescribe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt\\nit; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience\\nat what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known\\nto me then. However, my thoughts were at length carried in other\\ndirections, so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.\\nCHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.\\nAs Queequeg’s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to\\ncontinue all day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-\\nfall; for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody’s religious\\nobligations, never mind how comical, and could not find it in my\\nheart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a\\ntoad-stool; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth,\\nwho with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other\\nplanets, bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor\\nmerely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and\\nrented in his name.\\nI say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in\\nthese things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other\\nmortals, pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits\\non these subjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining\\nthe most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;—but what of\\nthat? Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he\\nseemed to be content; and there let him rest. All our arguing with\\nhim would not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us\\nall—Presbyterians and Pagans alike—for we are all somehow\\ndreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.\\nTowards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances\\nand rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the\\ndoor; but no answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.\\n“Queequeg,” said I softly through the key-hole:—all silent. “I say,\\nQueequeg! why don’t you speak? It’s I—Ishmael.” But all remained\\nstill as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such\\nabundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I\\nlooked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd\\ncorner of the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and\\nsinister one. I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and\\na line of the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to behold\\nresting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg’s harpoon,\\nwhich the landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before\\nour mounting to the chamber. That’s strange, thought I; but at any\\nrate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes\\nabroad without it, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible\\nmistake.\\n“Queequeg!—Queequeg!”—all \\nstill. \\nSomething \\nmust \\nhave\\nhappened. Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it\\nstubbornly resisted. Running down stairs, I quickly stated my\\nsuspicions to the first person I met—the chamber-maid. “La! la!” she\\ncried, “I thought something must be the matter. I went to make the\\nbed after breakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse to\\nbe heard; and it’s been just so silent ever since. But I thought, may\\nbe, you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe\\nkeeping. \\nLa! \\nla, \\nma’am!—Mistress! \\nmurder! \\nMrs. \\nHussey!\\napoplexy!”—and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I\\nfollowing.\\nMrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and\\na vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the\\noccupation of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black\\nboy meantime.\\n“Wood-house!” cried I, “which way to it? Run for God’s sake, and\\nfetch something to pry open the door—the axe!—the axe! he’s had\\na stroke; depend upon it!”—and so saying I was unmethodically\\nrushing up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed\\nthe mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her\\ncountenance.\\n“What’s the matter with you, young man?”\\n“Get the axe! For God’s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I\\npry it open!”\\n“Look here,” said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-\\ncruet, so as to have one hand free; “look here; are you talking about\\nprying open any of my doors?”—and with that she seized my arm.\\n“What’s the matter with you? What’s the matter with you,\\nshipmate?”\\nIn as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to\\nunderstand the whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-\\ncruet to one side of her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then\\nexclaimed—“No! I haven’t seen it since I put it there.” Running to a\\nlittle closet under the landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and\\nreturning, told me that Queequeg’s harpoon was missing. “He’s\\nkilled himself,” she cried. “It’s unfort’nate Stiggs done over again—\\nthere goes another counterpane—God pity his poor mother!—it will\\nbe the ruin of my house. Has the poor lad a sister? Where’s that\\ngirl?—there, Betty, go to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint\\nme a sign, with—“no suicides permitted here, and no smoking in\\nthe parlor;”—might as well kill both birds at once. Kill? The Lord be\\nmerciful to his ghost! What’s that noise there? You, young man,\\navast there!”\\nAnd running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to\\nforce open the door.\\n“I don’t allow it; I won’t have my premises spoiled. Go for the\\nlocksmith, there’s one about a mile from here. But avast!” putting\\nher hand in her side-pocket, “here’s a key that’ll fit, I guess; let’s\\nsee.” And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg’s\\nsupplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.\\n“Have to burst it open,” said I, and was running down the entry a\\nlittle, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again\\nvowing I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her,\\nand with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.\\nWith a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob\\nslamming against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there,\\ngood heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-\\ncollected; right in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams,\\nand holding Yojo on top of his head. He looked neither one way nor\\nthe other way, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of\\nactive life.\\n“Queequeg,” said I, going up to him, “Queequeg, what’s the\\nmatter with you?”\\n“He hain’t been a sittin’ so all day, has he?” said the landlady.\\nBut all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt\\nlike pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost\\nintolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;\\nespecially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of\\neight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.\\n“Mrs. Hussey,” said I, “he’s alive at all events; so leave us, if you\\nplease, and I will see to this strange affair myself.”\\nClosing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon\\nQueequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could\\ndo—for all my polite arts and blandishments—he would not move a\\npeg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my\\npresence in the slightest way.\\nI wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan;\\ndo they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be\\nso; yes, it’s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he’ll\\nget up sooner or later, no doubt. It can’t last for ever, thank God,\\nand his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don’t believe it’s\\nvery punctual then.\\nI went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the\\nlong stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-\\npudding voyage, as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in\\na schooner or brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic\\nOcean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly\\neleven o’clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by\\nthis time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a\\ntermination. But no; there he was just where I had left him; he had\\nnot stirred an inch. I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so\\ndownright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half\\nthe night on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on\\nhis head.\\n“For heaven’s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up\\nand have some supper. You’ll starve; you’ll kill yourself, Queequeg.”\\nBut not a word did he reply.\\nDespairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to\\nsleep; and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But\\nprevious to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it\\nover him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had\\nnothing but his ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I\\nwould, I could not get into the faintest doze. I had blown out the\\ncandle; and the mere thought of Queequeg—not four feet off—\\nsitting there in that uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and\\ndark; this made me really wretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in\\nthe same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary,\\nunaccountable Ramadan!\\nBut somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till\\nbreak of day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted\\nQueequeg, as if he had been screwed down to the floor. But as\\nsoon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got,\\nwith stiff and grating joints, but with a cheerful look; limped\\ntowards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again against mine;\\nand said his Ramadan was over.\\nNow, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person’s\\nreligion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or\\ninsult any other person, because that other person don’t believe it\\nalso. But when a man’s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a\\npositive torment to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an\\nuncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take that\\nindividual aside and argue the point with him.\\nAnd just so I now did with Queequeg. “Queequeg,” said I, “get\\ninto bed now, and lie and listen to me.” I then went on, beginning\\nwith the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming\\ndown to the various religions of the present time, during which time\\nI labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and\\nprolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark\\nnonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in short,\\nto the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense. I told him, too,\\nthat he being in other things such an extremely sensible and\\nsagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him\\nnow so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.\\nBesides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit\\ncaves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-\\nstarved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish\\nsuch melancholy notions about their hereafters. In one word,\\nQueequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an\\nundigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through\\nthe hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\\nI then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled\\nwith dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could\\ntake it in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was\\nafter a great feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a\\ngreat battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about\\ntwo o’clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very\\nevening.\\n“No more, Queequeg,” said I, shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew\\nthe inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor\\nwho had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the\\ncustom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all\\nthe slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,\\nthey were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round\\nlike a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in\\ntheir mouths, were sent round with the victor’s compliments to all\\nhis friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas\\nturkeys.\\nAfter all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made\\nmuch impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he\\nsomehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless\\nconsidered from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he\\ndid not more than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply\\nas I would; and, finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal\\nmore about the true religion than I did. He looked at me with a sort\\nof condescending concern and compassion, as though he thought it\\na great pity that such a sensible young man should be so\\nhopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.\\nAt last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously\\nhearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady\\nshould not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied\\nout to board the Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth\\nwith halibut bones.\\nCHAPTER 18. His Mark.\\nAs we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship,\\nQueequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice\\nloudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my\\nfriend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no\\ncannibals on board that craft, unless they previously produced their\\npapers.\\n“What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?” said I, now jumping\\non the bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.\\n“I mean,” he replied, “he must show his papers.”\\n“Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head\\nfrom behind Peleg’s, out of the wigwam. “He must show that he’s\\nconverted. Son of darkness,” he added, turning to Queequeg, “art\\nthou at present in communion with any Christian church?”\\n“Why,” said I, “he’s a member of the first Congregational Church.”\\nHere be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket\\nships at last come to be converted into the churches.\\n“First Congregational Church,” cried Bildad, “what! that worships in\\nDeacon Deuteronomy Coleman’s meeting-house?” and so saying,\\ntaking out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow\\nbandana handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out\\nof the wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good\\nlong look at Queequeg.\\n“How long hath he been a member?” he then said, turning to me;\\n“not very long, I rather guess, young man.”\\n“No,” said Peleg, “and he hasn’t been baptized right either, or it\\nwould have washed some of that devil’s blue off his face.”\\n“Do tell, now,” cried Bildad, “is this Philistine a regular member of\\nDeacon Deuteronomy’s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I\\npass it every Lord’s day.”\\n“I don’t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his\\nmeeting,” said I; “all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born\\nmember of the First Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself,\\nQueequeg is.”\\n“Young man,” said Bildad sternly, “thou art skylarking with me—\\nexplain thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean?\\nanswer me.”\\nFinding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. “I mean, sir, the same\\nancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg\\nthere, and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother’s son\\nand soul of us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation\\nof this whole worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of\\nus cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief;\\nin that we all join hands.”\\n“Splice, thou mean’st splice hands,” cried Peleg, drawing nearer.\\n“Young man, you’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-\\nmast hand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—\\nwhy Father Mapple himself couldn’t beat it, and he’s reckoned\\nsomething. Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the\\npapers. I say, tell Quohog there—what’s that you call him? tell\\nQuohog to step along. By the great anchor, what a harpoon he’s\\ngot there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it about right. I\\nsay, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the\\nhead of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?”\\nWithout saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped\\nupon the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-\\nboats hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and\\npoising his harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:—\\n“Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him?\\nwell, spose him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at\\nit, he darted the iron right over old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across\\nthe ship’s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.\\n“Now,” said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him\\nwhale-e eye; why, dad whale dead.”\\n“Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close\\nvicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin\\ngangway. “Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship’s papers. We\\nmust have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats.\\nLook ye, Quohog, we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more\\nthan ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”\\nSo down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg\\nwas soon enrolled among the same ship’s company to which I\\nmyself belonged.\\nWhen all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything\\nready for signing, he turned to me and said, “I guess, Quohog there\\ndon’t know how to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost\\nthou sign thy name or make thy mark?”\\nBut at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before\\ntaken part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but\\ntaking the offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place,\\nan exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed\\nupon his arm; so that through Captain Peleg’s obstinate mistake\\ntouching his appellative, it stood something like this:—\\nQuohog. his X mark.\\nMeanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing\\nQueequeg, and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge\\npockets of his broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts,\\nand selecting one entitled “The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to\\nLose,” placed it in Queequeg’s hands, and then grasping them and\\nthe book with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and said,\\n“Son of darkness, I must do my duty by thee; I am part owner of\\nthis ship, and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew; if thou still\\nclingest to thy Pagan ways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee,\\nremain not for aye a Belial bondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the\\nhideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say;\\noh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!”\\nSomething of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad’s language,\\nheterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.\\n“Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our\\nharpooneer,” cried Peleg. “Pious harpooneers never make good\\nvoyagers—it takes the shark out of ’em; no harpooneer is worth a\\nstraw who aint pretty sharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once\\nthe bravest boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he\\njoined the meeting, and never came to good. He got so frightened\\nabout his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from\\nwhales, for fear of after-claps, in case he got stove and went to\\nDavy Jones.”\\n“Peleg! Peleg!” said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, “thou\\nthyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest,\\nPeleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can’st thou\\nprate in this ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell\\nme, when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in\\nthat typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate\\nwith Captain Ahab, did’st thou not think of Death and the Judgment\\nthen?”\\n“Hear him, hear him now,” cried Peleg, marching across the cabin,\\nand thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,—“hear him, all of\\nye. Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would\\nsink! Death and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts\\nmaking such an everlasting thundering against the side; and every\\nsea breaking over us, fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment\\nthen? No! no time to think about Death then. Life was what Captain\\nAhab and I was thinking of; and how to save all hands—how to rig\\njury-masts—how to get into the nearest port; that was what I was\\nthinking of.”\\nBildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck,\\nwhere we followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking\\nsome sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now\\nand then he stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred\\ntwine, which otherwise might have been wasted.\\nCHAPTER 19. The Prophet.\\n“Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?”\\nQueequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering\\naway from the water, for the moment each occupied with his own\\nthoughts, when the above words were put to us by a stranger, who,\\npausing before us, levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in\\nquestion. He was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and\\npatched trowsers; a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck. A\\nconfluent small-pox had in all directions flowed over his face, and\\nleft it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing\\nwaters have been dried up.\\n“Have ye shipped in her?” he repeated.\\n“You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,” said I, trying to gain a\\nlittle more time for an uninterrupted look at him.\\n“Aye, the Pequod—that ship there,” he said, drawing back his\\nwhole arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with\\nthe fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.\\n“Yes,” said I, “we have just signed the articles.”\\n“Anything down there about your souls?”\\n“About what?”\\n“Oh, perhaps you hav’n’t got any,” he said quickly. “No matter\\nthough, I know many chaps that hav’n’t got any,—good luck to ’em;\\nand they are all the better off for it. A soul’s a sort of a fifth wheel\\nto a wagon.”\\n“What are you jabbering about, shipmate?” said I.\\n“He’s got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that\\nsort in other chaps,” abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous\\nemphasis upon the word he.\\n“Queequeg,” said I, “let’s go; this fellow has broken loose from\\nsomewhere; he’s talking about something and somebody we don’t\\nknow.”\\n“Stop!” cried the stranger. “Ye said true—ye hav’n’t seen Old\\nThunder yet, have ye?”\\n“Who’s Old Thunder?” said I, again riveted with the insane\\nearnestness of his manner.\\n“Captain Ahab.”\\n“What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?”\\n“Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name.\\nYe hav’n’t seen him yet, have ye?”\\n“No, we hav’n’t. He’s sick they say, but is getting better, and will\\nbe all right again before long.”\\n“All right again before long!” laughed the stranger, with a\\nsolemnly derisive sort of laugh. “Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all\\nright, then this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.”\\n“What do you know about him?”\\n“What did they tell you about him? Say that!”\\n“They didn’t tell much of anything about him; only I’ve heard that\\nhe’s a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.”\\n“That’s true, that’s true—yes, both true enough. But you must\\njump when he gives an order. Step and growl; growl and go—that’s\\nthe word with Captain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that\\nhappened to him off Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead\\nfor three days and nights; nothing about that deadly skrimmage\\nwith the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa?—heard nothing about\\nthat, eh? Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into? And\\nnothing about his losing his leg last voyage, according to the\\nprophecy. Didn’t ye hear a word about them matters and something\\nmore, eh? No, I don’t think ye did; how could ye? Who knows it?\\nNot all Nantucket, I guess. But hows’ever, mayhap, ye’ve heard tell\\nabout the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare\\nsay. Oh yes, that every one knows a’most—I mean they know he’s\\nonly one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off.”\\n“My friend,” said I, “what all this gibberish of yours is about, I\\ndon’t know, and I don’t much care; for it seems to me that you\\nmust be a little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of\\nCaptain Ahab, of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you,\\nthat I know all about the loss of his leg.”\\n“All about it, eh—sure you do?—all?”\\n“Pretty sure.”\\nWith finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-\\nlike stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then\\nstarting a little, turned and said:—“Ye’ve shipped, have ye? Names\\ndown on the papers? Well, well, what’s signed, is signed; and what’s\\nto be, will be; and then again, perhaps it won’t be, after all. Anyhow,\\nit’s all fixed and arranged a’ready; and some sailors or other must\\ngo with him, I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity\\n’em! Morning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless\\nye; I’m sorry I stopped ye.”\\n“Look here, friend,” said I, “if you have anything important to tell\\nus, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are\\nmistaken in your game; that’s all I have to say.”\\n“And it’s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way;\\nyou are just the man for him—the likes of ye. Morning to ye,\\nshipmates, morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell ’em I’ve concluded\\nnot to make one of ’em.”\\n“Ah, my dear fellow, you can’t fool us that way—you can’t fool us.\\nIt is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a\\ngreat secret in him.”\\n“Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.”\\n“Morning it is,” said I. “Come along, Queequeg, let’s leave this\\ncrazy man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?”\\n“Elijah.”\\nElijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after\\neach other’s fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that\\nhe was nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had\\nnot gone perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a\\ncorner, and looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah\\nfollowing us, though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him\\nstruck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind,\\nbut passed on with my comrade, anxious to see whether the\\nstranger would turn the same corner that we did. He did; and then\\nit seemed to me that he was dogging us, but with what intent I\\ncould not for the life of me imagine. This circumstance, coupled\\nwith his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of\\ntalk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half-\\napprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain\\nAhab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver\\ncalabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the\\nship the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and\\nthe voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other\\nshadowy things.\\nI was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was\\nreally dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with\\nQueequeg, and on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah\\npassed on, without seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once\\nmore, and finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart,\\na humbug.\\nCHAPTER 20. All Astir.\\nA day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the\\nPequod. Not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails\\nwere coming on board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in\\nshort, everything betokened that the ship’s preparations were\\nhurrying to a close. Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but\\nsat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad\\ndid all the purchasing and providing at the stores; and the men\\nemployed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long\\nafter night-fall.\\nOn the day following Queequeg’s signing the articles, word was\\ngiven at all the inns where the ship’s company were stopping, that\\ntheir chests must be on board before night, for there was no telling\\nhow soon the vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down\\nour traps, resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it\\nseems they always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship\\ndid not sail for several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal\\nto be done, and there is no telling how many things to be thought\\nof, before the Pequod was fully equipped.\\nEvery one knows what a multitude of things—beds, sauce-pans,\\nknives and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what\\nnot, are indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with\\nwhaling, which necessitates a three-years’ housekeeping upon the\\nwide ocean, far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers,\\nand bankers. And though this also holds true of merchant vessels,\\nyet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen. For\\nbesides the great length of the whaling voyage, the numerous\\narticles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the\\nimpossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually\\nfrequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling\\nvessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and\\nespecially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which\\nthe success of the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats,\\nspare spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and spare everythings,\\nalmost, but a spare Captain and duplicate ship.\\nAt the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of\\nthe Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef,\\nbread, water, fuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted,\\nfor some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board\\nof divers odds and ends of things, both large and small.\\nChief among those who did this fetching and carrying was\\nCaptain Bildad’s sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and\\nindefatigable spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed\\nresolved that, if she could help it, nothing should be found wanting\\nin the Pequod, after once fairly getting to sea. At one time she\\nwould come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward’s pantry;\\nanother time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate’s desk, where\\nhe kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of\\nsome one’s rheumatic back. Never did any woman better deserve\\nher name, which was Charity—Aunt Charity, as everybody called her.\\nAnd like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle\\nabout hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to\\nanything that promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to\\nall on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was\\nconcerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of well-\\nsaved dollars.\\nBut it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress\\ncoming on board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in\\none hand, and a still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was\\nBildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he\\ncarried about with him a long list of the articles needed, and at\\nevery fresh arrival, down went his mark opposite that article upon\\nthe paper. Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his\\nwhalebone den, roaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring up\\nto the riggers at the mast-head, and then concluded by roaring\\nback into his wigwam.\\nDuring these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited\\nthe craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was,\\nand when he was going to come on board his ship. To these\\nquestions they would answer, that he was getting better and better,\\nand was expected aboard every day; meantime, the two captains,\\nPeleg and Bildad, could attend to everything necessary to fit the\\nvessel for the voyage. If I had been downright honest with myself, I\\nwould have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy\\nbeing committed this way to so long a voyage, without once laying\\nmy eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it, so\\nsoon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea. But when a man\\nsuspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already\\ninvolved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his\\nsuspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I\\nsaid nothing, and tried to think nothing.\\nAt last it was given out that some time next day the ship would\\ncertainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early\\nstart.\\nCHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.\\nIt was nearly six o’clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when\\nwe drew nigh the wharf.\\n“There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,” said I\\nto Queequeg, “it can’t be shadows; she’s off by sunrise, I guess;\\ncome on!”\\n“Avast!” cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming\\nclose behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then\\ninsinuating himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in\\nthe uncertain twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It\\nwas Elijah.\\n“Going aboard?”\\n“Hands off, will you,” said I.\\n“Lookee here,” said Queequeg, shaking himself, “go ’way!”\\n“Ain’t going aboard, then?”\\n“Yes, we are,” said I, “but what business is that of yours? Do you\\nknow, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?”\\n“No, no, no; I wasn’t aware of that,” said Elijah, slowly and\\nwonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most\\nunaccountable glances.\\n“Elijah,” said I, “you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing.\\nWe are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer\\nnot to be detained.”\\n“Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?”\\n“He’s cracked, Queequeg,” said I, “come on.”\\n“Holloa!” cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed\\na few paces.\\n“Never mind him,” said I, “Queequeg, come on.”\\nBut he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on\\nmy shoulder, said—“Did ye see anything looking like men going\\ntowards that ship a while ago?”\\nStruck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying,\\n“Yes, I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be\\nsure.”\\n“Very dim, very dim,” said Elijah. “Morning to ye.”\\nOnce more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after\\nus; and touching my shoulder again, said, “See if you can find ’em\\nnow, will ye?\\n“Find who?”\\n“Morning to ye! morning to ye!” he rejoined, again moving off.\\n“Oh! I was going to warn ye against—but never mind, never mind—\\nit’s all one, all in the family too;—sharp frost this morning, ain’t it?\\nGood-bye to ye. Shan’t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it’s\\nbefore the Grand Jury.” And with these cracked words he finally\\ndeparted, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at\\nhis frantic impudence.\\nAt last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in\\nprofound quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked\\nwithin; the hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging.\\nGoing forward to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle\\nopen. Seeing a light, we went down, and found only an old rigger\\nthere, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole\\nlength upon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his\\nfolded arms. The profoundest slumber slept upon him.\\n“Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?”\\nsaid I, looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on\\nthe wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to;\\nhence I would have thought myself to have been optically deceived\\nin that matter, were it not for Elijah’s otherwise inexplicable\\nquestion. But I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper,\\njocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with\\nthe body; telling him to establish himself accordingly. He put his\\nhand upon the sleeper’s rear, as though feeling if it was soft\\nenough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.\\n“Gracious! Queequeg, don’t sit there,” said I.\\n“Oh! perry dood seat,” said Queequeg, “my country way; won’t\\nhurt him face.”\\n“Face!” said I, “call that his face? very benevolent countenance\\nthen; but how hard he breathes, he’s heaving himself; get off,\\nQueequeg, you are heavy, it’s grinding the face of the poor. Get off,\\nQueequeg! Look, he’ll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don’t wake.”\\nQueequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the\\nsleeper, and lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept\\nthe pipe passing over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile,\\nupon questioning him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to\\nunderstand that, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and\\nsofas of all sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, were\\nin the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans;\\nand to furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to\\nbuy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers\\nand alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much\\nbetter than those garden-chairs which are convertible into walking-\\nsticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and desiring him\\nto make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps in some\\ndamp marshy place.\\nWhile narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the\\ntomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the\\nsleeper’s head.\\n“What’s that for, Queequeg?”\\n“Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!”\\nHe was going on with some wild reminiscences about his\\ntomahawk-pipe, which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained\\nhis foes and soothed his soul, when we were directly attracted to\\nthe sleeping rigger. The strong vapor now completely filling the\\ncontracted hole, it began to tell upon him. He breathed with a sort\\nof muffledness; then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved\\nover once or twice; then sat up and rubbed his eyes.\\n“Holloa!” he breathed at last, “who be ye smokers?”\\n“Shipped men,” answered I, “when does she sail?”\\n“Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain\\ncame aboard last night.”\\n“What Captain?—Ahab?”\\n“Who but him indeed?”\\nI was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab,\\nwhen we heard a noise on deck.\\n“Holloa! Starbuck’s astir,” said the rigger. “He’s a lively chief mate,\\nthat; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.” And\\nso saying he went on deck, and we followed.\\nIt was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos\\nand threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively\\nengaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing\\nvarious last things on board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained\\ninvisibly enshrined within his cabin.\\nCHAPTER 22. Merry\\nChristmas.\\nAt length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship’s\\nriggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf,\\nand after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat,\\nwith her last gift—a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her\\nbrother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward—after all this, the\\ntwo Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning\\nto the chief mate, Peleg said:\\n“Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain\\nAhab is all ready—just spoke to him—nothing more to be got from\\nshore, eh? Well, call all hands, then. Muster ’em aft here—blast ’em!”\\n“No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,” said\\nBildad, “but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.”\\nHow now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage,\\nCaptain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on\\nthe quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea,\\nas well as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no\\nsign of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin.\\nBut then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means\\nnecessary in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out\\nto sea. Indeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the\\npilot’s; and as he was not yet completely recovered—so they said—\\ntherefore, Captain Ahab stayed below. And all this seemed natural\\nenough; especially as in the merchant service many captains never\\nshow themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up\\nthe anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell\\nmerry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for\\ngood with the pilot.\\nBut there was not much chance to think over the matter, for\\nCaptain Peleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the\\ntalking and commanding, and not Bildad.\\n“Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,” he cried, as the sailors lingered at\\nthe main-mast. “Mr. Starbuck, drive ’em aft.”\\n“Strike the tent there!”—was the next order. As I hinted before,\\nthis whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on\\nboard the Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was\\nwell known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.\\n“Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!—jump!”—was the next\\ncommand, and the crew sprang for the handspikes.\\nNow in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by\\nthe pilot is the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with\\nPeleg, be it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the\\nlicensed pilots of the port—he being suspected to have got himself\\nmade a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships\\nhe was concerned in, for he never piloted any other craft—Bildad, I\\nsay, might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows\\nfor the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a\\ndismal stave of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who\\nroared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley,\\nwith hearty good will. Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad\\nhad told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board\\nthe Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity, his\\nsister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman’s\\nberth.\\nMeantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg\\nripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost\\nthought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up;\\ninvoluntarily I paused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do\\nthe same, thinking of the perils we both ran, in starting on the\\nvoyage with such a devil for a pilot. I was comforting myself,\\nhowever, with the thought that in pious Bildad might be found\\nsome salvation, spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay;\\nwhen I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and turning round, was\\nhorrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of\\nwithdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first\\nkick.\\n“Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?” he roared.\\n“Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why\\ndon’t ye spring, I say, all of ye—spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap\\nwith the red whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green\\npants. Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!” And so\\nsaying, he moved along the windlass, here and there using his leg\\nvery freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his\\npsalmody. Thinks I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking\\nsomething to-day.\\nAt last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It\\nwas a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged\\ninto night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean,\\nwhose freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long\\nrows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like\\nthe white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles\\ndepended from the bows.\\nLank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon,\\nas the old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the\\nshivering frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage\\nrang, his steady notes were heard,—\\n      “Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,\\n         Stand dressed in living green.\\n      So to the Jews old Canaan stood,\\n         While Jordan rolled between.”\\nNever did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than\\nthen. They were full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter\\nnight in the boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter\\njacket, there was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven\\nin store; and meads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass\\nshot up by the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.\\nAt last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed\\nno longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began\\nranging alongside.\\nIt was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were\\naffected at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to\\ndepart, yet; very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long\\nand perilous a voyage—beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which\\nsome thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in\\nwhich an old shipmate sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he,\\nonce more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw;\\nloath to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every\\ninterest to him,—poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with\\nanxious strides; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell\\nword there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked\\ntowards the wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off\\nunseen Eastern Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft;\\nlooked right and left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last,\\nmechanically coiling a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout\\nPeleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment stood\\ngazing heroically in his face, as much as to say, “Nevertheless, friend\\nPeleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.”\\nAs for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all\\nhis philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the\\nlantern came too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin\\nto deck—now a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the\\nchief mate.\\nBut, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look\\nabout him,—“Captain Bildad—come, old shipmate, we must go.\\nBack the main-yard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close\\nalongside, now! Careful, careful!—come, Bildad, boy—say your last.\\nLuck to ye, Starbuck—luck to ye, Mr. Stubb—luck to ye, Mr. Flask—\\ngood-bye and good luck to ye all—and this day three years I’ll have\\na hot supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!”\\n“God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,” murmured\\nold Bildad, almost incoherently. “I hope ye’ll have fine weather now,\\nso that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye—a pleasant\\nsun is all he needs, and ye’ll have plenty of them in the tropic\\nvoyage ye go. Be careful in the hunt, ye mates. Don’t stave the\\nboats needlessly, ye harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised\\nfull three per cent. within the year. Don’t forget your prayers, either.\\nMr. Starbuck, mind that cooper don’t waste the spare staves. Oh!\\nthe sail-needles are in the green locker! Don’t whale it too much a’\\nLord’s days, men; but don’t miss a fair chance either, that’s rejecting\\nHeaven’s good gifts. Have an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb;\\nit was a little leaky, I thought. If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask,\\nbeware of fornication. Good-bye, good-bye! Don’t keep that cheese\\ntoo long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it’ll spoil. Be careful with\\nthe butter—twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye, if—”\\n“Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,—away!” and with\\nthat, Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.\\nShip and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew\\nbetween; a screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled;\\nwe gave three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate\\ninto the lone Atlantic.\\nCHAPTER 23. The Lee Shore.\\nSome chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall,\\nnewlanded mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.\\nWhen on that shivering winter’s night, the Pequod thrust her\\nvindictive bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see\\nstanding at her helm but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe\\nand fearfulness upon the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a\\nfour years’ dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again\\nfor still another tempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to\\nhis feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep\\nmemories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless\\ngrave of Bulkington. Let me only say that it fared with him as with\\nthe storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land.\\nThe port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is\\nsafety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that’s\\nkind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that\\nship’s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land,\\nthough it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and\\nthrough. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so\\ndoing, fights ’gainst the very winds that fain would blow her\\nhomeward; seeks all the lashed sea’s landlessness again; for refuge’s\\nsake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!\\nKnow ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that\\nmortally intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the\\nintrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her\\nsea; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast\\nher on the treacherous, slavish shore?\\nBut as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,\\nindefinite as God—so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite,\\nthan be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety!\\nFor worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of\\nthe terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O\\nBulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy\\nocean-perishing—straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!\\nCHAPTER 24. The Advocate.\\nAs Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of\\nwhaling; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be\\nregarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable\\npursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of\\nthe injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales.\\nIn the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to\\nestablish the fact, that among people at large, the business of\\nwhaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal\\nprofessions. If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous\\nmetropolitan society, it would but slightly advance the general\\nopinion of his merits, were he presented to the company as a\\nharpooneer, say; and if in emulation of the naval officers he should\\nappend the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his visiting card,\\nsuch a procedure would be deemed pre-eminently presuming and\\nridiculous.\\nDoubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us\\nwhalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to\\na butchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged\\ntherein, we are surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers\\nwe are, that is true. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest\\nbadge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world\\ninvariably delights to honor. And as for the matter of the alleged\\nuncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into certain\\nfacts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the whole,\\nwill triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at least among the\\ncleanliest things of this tidy earth. But even granting the charge in\\nquestion to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a whale-ship\\nare comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle-fields\\nfrom which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies’ plaudits?\\nAnd if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of\\nthe soldier’s profession; let me assure ye that many a veteran who\\nhas freely marched up to a battery, would quickly recoil at the\\napparition of the sperm whale’s vast tail, fanning into eddies the air\\nover his head. For what are the comprehensible terrors of man\\ncompared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God!\\nBut, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it\\nunwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding\\nadoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn\\nround the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!\\nBut look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of\\nscales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.\\nWhy did the Dutch in De Witt’s time have admirals of their\\nwhaling fleets? Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal\\nexpense, fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to\\nthat town some score or two of families from our own island of\\nNantucket? Why did Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay\\nto her whalemen in bounties upwards of £1,000,000? And lastly,\\nhow comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the\\nrest of the banded whalemen in the world; sail a navy of upwards of\\nseven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen thousand men; yearly\\nconsuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth, at the time of\\nsailing, $20,000,000! and every year importing into our harbors a\\nwell reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if there be\\nnot something puissant in whaling?\\nBut this is not the half; look again.\\nI freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his\\nlife, point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last\\nsixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad\\nworld, taken in one aggregate, than the high and mighty business\\nof whaling. One way and another, it has begotten events so\\nremarkable in themselves, and so continuously momentous in their\\nsequential issues, that whaling may well be regarded as that\\nEgyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her\\nwomb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to catalogue all these\\nthings. Let a handful suffice. For many years past the whale-ship has\\nbeen the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known\\nparts of the earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes which\\nhad no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If\\nAmerican and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once\\nsavage harbors, let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the\\nwhale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and first\\ninterpreted between them and the savages. They may celebrate as\\nthey will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your Cooks, your\\nKrusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous Captains have\\nsailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and greater than your\\nCook and your Krusenstern. For in their succourless empty-\\nhandedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters, and by the\\nbeaches of unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with virgin wonders\\nand terrors that Cook with all his marines and muskets would not\\nwillingly have dared. All that is made such a flourish of in the old\\nSouth Sea Voyages, those things were but the life-time\\ncommonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures which\\nVancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted\\nunworthy of being set down in the ship’s common log. Ah, the\\nworld! Oh, the world!\\nUntil the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but\\ncolonial, scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on\\nbetween Europe and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces\\non the Pacific coast. It was the whaleman who first broke through\\nthe jealous policy of the Spanish crown, touching those colonies;\\nand, if space permitted, it might be distinctly shown how from those\\nwhalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia\\nfrom the yoke of Old Spain, and the establishment of the eternal\\ndemocracy in those parts.\\nThat great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was\\ngiven to the enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first\\nblunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long\\nshunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship\\ntouched there. The whale-ship is the true mother of that now\\nmighty colony. Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian\\nsettlement, the emigrants were several times saved from starvation\\nby the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an\\nanchor in their waters. The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess\\nthe same truth, and do commercial homage to the whale-ship, that\\ncleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in many\\ncases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations. If\\nthat double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is\\nthe whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due; for already she\\nis on the threshold.\\nBut if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no\\næsthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to\\nshiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split\\nhelmet every time.\\nThe whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous\\nchronicler, you will say.\\nThe whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler?\\nWho wrote the first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job!\\nAnd who composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who,\\nbut no less a prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal\\npen, took down the words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter\\nof those times! And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in\\nParliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!\\nTrue enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they\\nhave no good blood in their veins.\\nNo good blood in their veins? They have something better than\\nroyal blood there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary\\nMorrel; afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers\\nof Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and\\nharpooneers—all kith and kin to noble Benjamin—this day darting\\nthe barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.\\nGood again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not\\nrespectable.\\nWhaling not respectable? Whaling is imperial! By old English\\nstatutory law, the whale is declared “a royal fish.” *\\nOh, that’s only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in\\nany grand imposing way.\\nThe whale never figured in any grand imposing way? In one of\\nthe mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering\\nthe world’s capital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from\\nthe Syrian coast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed\\nprocession.*\\n*See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.\\nGrant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real\\ndignity in whaling.\\nNo dignity in whaling? The dignity of our calling the very heavens\\nattest. Cetus is a constellation in the South! No more! Drive down\\nyour hat in presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No\\nmore! I know a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred\\nand fifty whales. I account that man more honorable than that great\\ncaptain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.\\nAnd, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet\\nundiscovered prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real\\nrepute in that small but high hushed world which I might not be\\nunreasonably ambitious of; if hereafter I shall do anything that,\\nupon the whole, a man might rather have done than to have left\\nundone; if, at my death, my executors, or more properly my\\ncreditors, find any precious MSS. in my desk, then here I\\nprospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling; for a\\nwhale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.\\nCHAPTER 25. Postscript.\\nIn behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught\\nbut substantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an advocate\\nwho should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which\\nmight tell eloquently upon his cause—such an advocate, would he\\nnot be blameworthy?\\nIt is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even\\nmodern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their\\nfunctions is gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called,\\nand there may be a castor of state. How they use the salt, precisely\\n—who knows? Certain I am, however, that a king’s head is solemnly\\noiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be, though,\\nthat they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well, as they\\nanoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here, concerning the\\nessential dignity of this regal process, because in common life we\\nesteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair,\\nand palpably smells of that anointing. In truth, a mature man who\\nuses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a\\nquoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can’t amount\\nto much in his totality.\\nBut the only thing to be considered here, is this—what kind of oil\\nis used at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar\\noil, nor castor oil, nor bear’s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil. What\\nthen can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured,\\nunpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?\\nThink of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings\\nand queens with coronation stuff!\\nCHAPTER 26. Knights and\\nSquires.\\nThe chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of\\nNantucket, and a Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man,\\nand though born on an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure\\nhot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit.\\nTransported to the Indies, his live blood would not spoil like bottled\\nale. He must have been born in some time of general drought and\\nfamine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is\\nfamous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those\\nsummers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his\\nthinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting\\nanxieties and cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily\\nblight. It was merely the condensation of the man. He was by no\\nmeans ill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an\\nexcellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner\\nhealth and strength, like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed\\nprepared to endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as\\nnow; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer,\\nhis interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates. Looking\\ninto his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of\\nthose thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A\\nstaid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling\\npantomime of action, and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all\\nhis hardy sobriety and fortitude, there were certain qualities in him\\nwhich at times affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to\\noverbalance all the rest. Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman,\\nand endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery\\nloneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to\\nsuperstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some\\norganizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence\\nthan from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments\\nwere his. And if at times these things bent the welded iron of his\\nsoul, much more did his far-away domestic memories of his young\\nCape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from the original\\nruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those latent\\ninfluences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of\\ndare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous\\nvicissitudes of the fishery. “I will have no man in my boat,” said\\nStarbuck, “who is not afraid of a whale.” By this, he seemed to\\nmean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that\\nwhich arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but\\nthat an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a\\ncoward.\\n“Aye, aye,” said Stubb, the second mate, “Starbuck, there, is as\\ncareful a man as you’ll find anywhere in this fishery.” But we shall\\nere long see what that word “careful” precisely means when used by\\na man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.\\nStarbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a\\nsentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand\\nupon all mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps,\\nthat in this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple\\noutfits of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be\\nfoolishly wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales\\nafter sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much\\npersisted in fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this\\ncritical ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by\\nthem for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed\\nStarbuck well knew. What doom was his own father’s? Where, in the\\nbottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?\\nWith memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a\\ncertain superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this\\nStarbuck which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have\\nbeen extreme. But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so\\norganized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as\\nhe had; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently\\nengendering \\nan \\nelement \\nin \\nhim, \\nwhich, \\nunder \\nsuitable\\ncircumstances, would break out from its confinement, and burn all\\nhis courage up. And brave as he might be, it was that sort of\\nbravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally\\nabiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of\\nthe ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand\\nthose more terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes\\nmenace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty\\nman.\\nBut were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the\\ncomplete abasement of poor Starbuck’s fortitude, scarce might I\\nhave the heart to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay\\nshocking, to expose the fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem\\ndetestable as joint stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and\\nmurderers there may be; men may have mean and meagre faces;\\nbut man, in the ideal, is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand\\nand glowing creature, that over any ignominious blemish in him all\\nhis fellows should run to throw their costliest robes. That\\nimmaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so far within us, that\\nit remains intact though all the outer character seem gone; bleeds\\nwith keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined\\nman. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight, completely stifle\\nher upbraidings against the permitting stars. But this august dignity\\nI treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding\\ndignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt see it shining in\\nthe arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that democratic dignity\\nwhich, on all hands, radiates without end from God; Himself! The\\ngreat God absolute! The centre and circumference of all democracy!\\nHis omnipresence, our divine equality!\\nIf, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I\\nshall hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round\\nthem tragic graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most\\nabased, among them all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted\\nmounts; if I shall touch that workman’s arm with some ethereal light;\\nif I shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then\\nagainst all mortal critics bear me out in it, thou just Spirit of\\nEquality, which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all\\nmy kind! Bear me out in it, thou great democratic God! who didst\\nnot refuse to the swart convict, Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou\\nwho didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold, the\\nstumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst pick\\nup Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a\\nwar-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou who,\\nin all Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest\\nchampions from the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O God!\\nCHAPTER 27. Knights and\\nSquires.\\nStubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and\\nhence, according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A\\nhappy-go-lucky; neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they\\ncame with an indifferent air; and while engaged in the most\\nimminent crisis of the chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a\\njourneyman joiner engaged for the year. Good-humored, easy, and\\ncareless, he presided over his whale-boat as if the most deadly\\nencounter were but a dinner, and his crew all invited guests. He was\\nas particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the\\nboat, as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box. When\\nclose to the whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled\\nhis unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his\\nhammer. He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and\\nflank with the most exasperated monster. Long usage had, for this\\nStubb, converted the jaws of death into an easy chair. What he\\nthought of death itself, there is no telling. Whether he ever thought\\nof it at all, might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast\\nhis mind that way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good\\nsailor, he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft,\\nand bestir themselves there, about something which he would find\\nout when he obeyed the order, and not sooner.\\nWhat, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-\\ngoing, unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of\\nlife in a world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with\\ntheir packs; what helped to bring about that almost impious good-\\nhumor of his; that thing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose,\\nhis short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face.\\nYou would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his\\nbunk without his nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of\\npipes there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his\\nhand; and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in\\nsuccession, lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter;\\nthen loading them again to be in readiness anew. For, when Stubb\\ndressed, instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his\\npipe into his mouth.\\nI say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least,\\nof his peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,\\nwhether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless\\nmiseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and\\nas in time of the cholera, some people go about with a\\ncamphorated handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all\\nmortal tribulations, Stubb’s tobacco smoke might have operated as\\na sort of disinfecting agent.\\nThe third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha’s\\nVineyard. A short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious\\nconcerning whales, who somehow seemed to think that the great\\nleviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him; and\\ntherefore it was a sort of point of honor with him, to destroy them\\nwhenever encountered. So utterly lost was he to all sense of\\nreverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic\\nways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible\\ndanger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the\\nwondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least\\nwater-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small\\napplication of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This\\nignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish\\nin the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and\\na three years’ voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that\\nlasted that length of time. As a carpenter’s nails are divided into\\nwrought nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided.\\nLittle Flask was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and\\nlast long. They called him King-Post on board of the Pequod;\\nbecause, in form, he could be well likened to the short, square\\ntimber known by that name in Arctic whalers; and which by the\\nmeans of many radiating side timbers inserted into it, serves to\\nbrace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas.\\nNow these three mates—Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were\\nmomentous men. They it was who by universal prescription\\ncommanded three of the Pequod’s boats as headsmen. In that\\ngrand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably\\nmarshal his forces to descend on the whales, these three headsmen\\nwere as captains of companies. Or, being armed with their long\\nkeen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers; even as\\nthe harpooneers were flingers of javelins.\\nAnd since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a\\nGothic Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or\\nharpooneer, who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh\\nlance, when the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in\\nthe assault; and moreover, as there generally subsists between the\\ntwo, a close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that\\nin this place we set down who the Pequod’s harpooneers were, and\\nto what headsman each of them belonged.\\nFirst of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had\\nselected for his squire. But Queequeg is already known.\\nNext was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most\\nwesterly promontory of Martha’s Vineyard, where there still exists\\nthe last remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied\\nthe neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring\\nharpooneers. In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of\\nGay-Headers. Tashtego’s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,\\nand black rounding eyes—for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness,\\nbut Antarctic in their glittering expression—all this sufficiently\\nproclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud\\nwarrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, had\\nscoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main. But no\\nlonger snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland,\\nTashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea;\\nthe unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of\\nthe sires. To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you\\nwould almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier\\nPuritans, and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince\\nof the Powers of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mate’s\\nsquire.\\nThird among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black\\nnegro-savage, with a lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus to behold.\\nSuspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the\\nsailors called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-\\nsail halyards to them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped\\non board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And\\nnever having been anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket,\\nand the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen; and having\\nnow led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of\\nowners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped;\\nDaggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a giraffe,\\nmoved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks.\\nThere was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white\\nman standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of\\na fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo,\\nwas the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man beside\\nhim. As for the residue of the Pequod’s company, be it said, that at\\nthe present day not one in two of the many thousand men before\\nthe mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans\\nborn, though pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same\\nwith the American whale fishery as with the American army and\\nmilitary and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed\\nin the construction of the American Canals and Railroads. The same,\\nI say, because in all these cases the native American liberally\\nprovides the brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying\\nthe muscles. No small number of these whaling seamen belong to\\nthe Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently\\ntouch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those\\nrocky shores. In like manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of\\nHull or London, put in at the Shetland Islands, to receive the full\\ncomplement of their crew. Upon the passage homewards, they drop\\nthem there again. How it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem\\nto make the best whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders in the\\nPequod, Isolatoes too, I call such, not acknowledging the common\\ncontinent of men, but each Isolato living on a separate continent of\\nhis own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these\\nIsolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of\\nthe sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in\\nthe Pequod to lay the world’s grievances before that bar from which\\nnot very many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip—he never\\ndid—oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim\\nPequod’s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his\\ntambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great\\nquarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his\\ntambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!\\nCHAPTER 28. Ahab.\\nFor several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches\\nwas seen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other\\nat the watches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary,\\nthey seemed to be the only commanders of the ship; only they\\nsometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and\\nperemptory, that after all it was plain they but commanded\\nvicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and dictator was there, though\\nhitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the\\nnow sacred retreat of the cabin.\\nEvery time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I\\ninstantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my\\nfirst vague disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the\\nseclusion of the sea, became almost a perturbation. This was\\nstrangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah’s diabolical\\nincoherences uninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle energy I\\ncould not have before conceived of. But poorly could I withstand\\nthem, much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile at the\\nsolemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves. But\\nwhatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness—to call it so—\\nwhich I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it\\nseemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions. For though\\nthe harpooneers, with the great body of the crew, were a far more\\nbarbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the tame\\nmerchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made\\nme acquainted with, still I ascribed this—and rightly ascribed it—to\\nthe fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian\\nvocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was\\nespecially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the\\nmates, which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless\\nmisgivings, and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every\\npresentment of the voyage. Three better, more likely sea-officers\\nand men, each in his own different way, could not readily be found,\\nand they were every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer, a\\nVineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being Christmas when the ship shot\\nfrom out her harbor, for a space we had biting Polar weather,\\nthough all the time running away from it to the southward; and by\\nevery degree and minute of latitude which we sailed, gradually\\nleaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable weather behind\\nus. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy\\nenough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship\\nwas rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and\\nmelancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the\\nforenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail,\\nforeboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension;\\nCaptain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.\\nThere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of\\nthe recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the\\nstake, when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without\\nconsuming them, or taking away one particle from their compacted\\naged robustness. His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid\\nbronze, and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini’s cast\\nPerseus. Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and\\ncontinuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and\\nneck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like\\nmark, lividly whitish. It resembled that perpendicular seam\\nsometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when\\nthe upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching\\na single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom,\\nere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but\\nbranded. Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it was\\nthe scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say.\\nBy some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion\\nwas made to it, especially by the mates. But once Tashtego’s senior,\\nan old Gay-Head Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted\\nthat not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way\\nbranded, and then it came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal\\nfray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed\\ninferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old\\nsepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket,\\nhad never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old\\nsea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested this\\nold Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no\\nwhite sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever\\nCaptain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly\\ncome to pass, so he muttered—then, whoever should do that last\\noffice for the dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to\\nsole.\\nSo powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and\\nthe livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I\\nhardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was\\nowing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood. It had\\npreviously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned\\nfrom the polished bone of the sperm whale’s jaw. “Aye, he was\\ndismasted off Japan,” said the old Gay-Head Indian once; “but like\\nhis dismasted craft, he shipped another mast without coming home\\nfor it. He has a quiver of ’em.”\\nI was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each\\nside of the Pequod’s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen\\nshrouds, there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so,\\ninto the plank. His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated,\\nand holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight\\nout beyond the ship’s ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of\\nfirmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the\\nfixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he\\nspoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their\\nminutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy,\\nif not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye.\\nAnd not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with\\na crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity\\nof some mighty woe.\\nEre long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.\\nBut after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either\\nstanding in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or\\nheavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed,\\nbegan to grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse;\\nas if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead\\nwintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by\\nand by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air;\\nbut, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last\\nsunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But\\nthe Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly cruising;\\nnearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were\\nfully competent to, so that there was little or nothing, out of himself,\\nto employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that one\\ninterval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow,\\nas ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.\\nNevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\\npleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm\\nhim from his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls,\\nApril and May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even\\nthe barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least\\nsend forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted\\nvisitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little respond to the playful\\nallurings of that girlish air. More than once did he put forth the faint\\nblossom of a look, which, in any other man, would have soon\\nflowered out in a smile.\\nCHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to\\nHim, Stubb.\\nSome days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod\\nnow went rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea,\\nalmost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of\\nthe Tropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,\\nredundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped\\nup—flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights\\nseemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in\\nlonely pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the\\ngolden helmeted suns! For sleeping man, ’twas hard to choose\\nbetween such winsome days and such seducing nights. But all the\\nwitcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells\\nand potencies to the outward world. Inward they turned upon the\\nsoul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then,\\nmemory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless\\ntwilights. And all these subtle agencies, more and more they\\nwrought on Ahab’s texture.\\nOld age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less\\nman has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-\\ncommanders, the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to\\nvisit the night-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of\\nlate, he seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking,\\nhis visits were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks.\\n“It feels like going down into one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to\\nhimself—“for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow\\nscuttle, to go to my grave-dug berth.”\\nSo, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the\\nnight were set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of\\nthe band below; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the\\nforecastle, the sailors flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with\\nsome cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their\\nslumbering shipmates; when this sort of steady quietude would\\nbegin to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman would watch the\\ncabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge, gripping at\\nthe iron banister, to help his crippled way. Some considering touch\\nof humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually abstained\\nfrom patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates,\\nseeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have\\nbeen the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their\\ndreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks. But\\nonce, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings; and\\nas with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from\\ntaffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from\\nbelow, with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted\\nthat if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one\\ncould say nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise;\\nhinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow,\\nand the insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not\\nknow Ahab then.\\n“Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,” said Ahab, “that thou wouldst wad\\nme that fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly\\ngrave; where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the\\nfilling one at last.—Down, dog, and kennel!”\\nStarting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so\\nsuddenly scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then\\nsaid excitedly, “I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but\\nless than half like it, sir.”\\n“Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving\\naway, as if to avoid some passionate temptation.\\n“No, sir; not yet,” said Stubb, emboldened, “I will not tamely be\\ncalled a dog, sir.”\\n“Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and\\nbegone, or I’ll clear the world of thee!”\\nAs he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing\\nterrors in his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.\\n“I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,”\\nmuttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle.\\n“It’s very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don’t well know\\nwhether to go back and strike him, or—what’s that?—down here on\\nmy knees and pray for him? Yes, that was the thought coming up in\\nme; but it would be the first time I ever did pray. It’s queer; very\\nqueer; and he’s queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he’s about the\\nqueerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!—\\nhis eyes like powder-pans! is he mad? Anyway there’s something on\\nhis mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it\\ncracks. He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours out of\\nthe twenty-four; and he don’t sleep then. Didn’t that Dough-Boy,\\nthe steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man’s\\nhammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at\\nthe foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a\\nsort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A hot\\nold man! I guess he’s got what some folks ashore call a conscience;\\nit’s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse nor a toothache. Well,\\nwell; I don’t know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it.\\nHe’s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for,\\nevery night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what’s that for, I\\nshould like to know? Who’s made appointments with him in the\\nhold? Ain’t that queer, now? But there’s no telling, it’s the old game\\n—Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it’s worth a fellow’s while to\\nbe born into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I\\nthink of it, that’s about the first thing babies do, and that’s a sort of\\nqueer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of ’em.\\nBut that’s against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh\\ncommandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth—So here\\ngoes again. But how’s that? didn’t he call me a dog? blazes! he\\ncalled me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of\\nthat! He might as well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he\\ndid kick me, and I didn’t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his\\nbrow, somehow. It flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil’s the\\nmatter with me? I don’t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of\\nthat old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I\\nmust have been dreaming, though—How? how? how?—but the only\\nway’s to stash it; so here goes to hammock again; and in the\\nmorning, I’ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight.”\\nCHAPTER 30. The Pipe.\\nWhen Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over\\nthe bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a\\nsailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also\\nhis pipe. Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the\\nstool on the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.\\nIn old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings\\nwere fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How\\ncould one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones,\\nwithout bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of\\nthe plank, and a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was\\nAhab.\\nSome moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from\\nhis mouth in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into\\nhis face. “How now,” he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube,\\n“this smoking no longer soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with\\nme if thy charm be gone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling,\\nnot pleasuring—aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the\\nwhile; to windward, and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the\\ndying whale, my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble.\\nWhat business have I with this pipe? This thing that is meant for\\nsereneness, to send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs,\\nnot among torn iron-grey locks like mine. I’ll smoke no more—”\\nHe tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the\\nwaves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking\\npipe made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.\\nCHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.\\nNext morning Stubb accosted Flask.\\n“Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old\\nman’s ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I\\ntried to kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right\\noff! And then, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing\\nfool, kept kicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask—you\\nknow how curious all dreams are—through all this rage that I was\\nin, I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was\\nnot much of an insult, that kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s\\nthe row? It’s not a real leg, only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty\\ndifference between a living thump and a dead thump. That’s what\\nmakes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear\\nthan a blow from a cane. The living member—that makes the living\\ninsult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the while, mind, while\\nI was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid—so\\nconfoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I say, I was\\nthinking to myself, ‘what’s his leg now, but a cane—a whalebone\\ncane. Yes,’ thinks I, ‘it was only a playful cudgelling—in fact, only a\\nwhaleboning that he gave me—not a base kick. Besides,’ thinks I,\\n‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the foot part—what a small sort\\nof end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me, there’s a\\ndevilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a point only.’\\nBut now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I was\\nbattering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman,\\nwith a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me\\nround. ‘What are you ’bout?’ says he. Slid! man, but I was\\nfrightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over the\\nfright. ‘What am I about?’ says I at last. ‘And what business is that of\\nyours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do you want a kick?’\\nBy the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned round\\nhis stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had\\nfor a clout—what do you think, I saw?—why thunder alive, man, his\\nstern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on\\nsecond thoughts, ‘I guess I won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’\\nsaid he, ‘wise Stubb;’ and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of\\neating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn’t going\\nto stop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise Stubb,’ I thought I might as\\nwell fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my\\nfoot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop that kicking!’ ‘Halloa,’ says I,\\n‘what’s the matter now, old fellow?’ ‘Look ye here,’ says he; ‘let’s\\nargue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’\\nsays I—‘right here it was.’ ‘Very good,’ says he—‘he used his ivory\\nleg, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I. ‘Well then,’ says he, ‘wise Stubb,\\nwhat have you to complain of? Didn’t he kick with right good will?\\nit wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you\\nwere kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.\\nIt’s an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old\\nEngland the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a\\nqueen, and made garter-knights of; but, be your boast, Stubb, that\\nye were kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember\\nwhat I say; be kicked by him; account his kicks honors; and on no\\naccount kick back; for you can’t help yourself, wise Stubb. Don’t you\\nsee that pyramid?’ With that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow,\\nin some queer fashion, to swim off into the air. I snored; rolled over;\\nand there I was in my hammock! Now, what do you think of that\\ndream, Flask?”\\n“I don’t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.’”\\n“May be; may be. But it’s made a wise man of me, Flask. D’ye see\\nAhab standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best\\nthing you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to\\nhim, whatever he says. Halloa! What’s that he shouts? Hark!”\\n“Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales\\nhereabouts!\\n“If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!\\n“What do you think of that now, Flask? ain’t there a small drop of\\nsomething queer about that, eh? A white whale—did ye mark that,\\nman? Look ye—there’s something special in the wind. Stand by for\\nit, Flask. Ahab has that that’s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he\\ncomes this way.”\\nCHAPTER 32. Cetology.\\nAlready we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall\\nbe lost in its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to\\npass; ere the Pequod’s weedy hull rolls side by side with the\\nbarnacled hulls of the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend\\nto a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative\\nunderstanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and\\nallusions of all sorts which are to follow.\\nIt is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad\\ngenera, that I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task.\\nThe classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here\\nessayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid\\ndown.\\n“No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is\\nentitled Cetology,” says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.\\n“It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the\\ninquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups\\nand families. * * * Utter confusion exists among the historians of this\\nanimal” (sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.\\n“Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.”\\n“Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.” “A field\\nstrewn with thorns.” “All these incomplete indications but serve to\\ntorture us naturalists.”\\nThus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and\\nLesson, those lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though\\nof real knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty;\\nand so in some small degree, with cetology, or the science of\\nwhales. Many are the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen\\nand seamen, who have at large or in little, written of the whale. Run\\nover a few:—The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir\\nThomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnæus; Rondeletius; Willoughby;\\nGreen; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacépède; Bonneterre;\\nDesmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen;\\nScoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; the Author of Miriam\\nCoffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what ultimate\\ngeneralizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts\\nwill show.\\nOf the names in this list of whale authors, only those following\\nOwen ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real\\nprofessional harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby.\\nOn the separate subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the\\nbest existing authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing\\nof the great sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland\\nwhale is almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it said, that the\\nGreenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas. He is\\nnot even by any means the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the\\nlong priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till\\nsome seventy years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly\\nunknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still\\nreigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this\\nusurpation has been every way complete. Reference to nearly all the\\nleviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days, will satisfy you\\nthat the Greenland whale, without one rival, was to them the\\nmonarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a new\\nproclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,—the\\nGreenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm whale now reigneth!\\nThere are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the\\nliving sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the\\nremotest degree succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale’s\\nand Bennett’s; both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea\\nwhale-ships, and both exact and reliable men. The original matter\\ntouching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is\\nnecessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality,\\nthough mostly confined to scientific description. As yet, however,\\nthe sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any\\nliterature. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten life.\\nNow the various species of whales need some sort of popular\\ncomprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the\\npresent, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent\\nlaborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I\\nhereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing\\ncomplete; because any human thing supposed to be complete, must\\nfor that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a\\nminute anatomical description of the various species, or—in this\\nplace at least—to much of any description. My object here is simply\\nto project the draught of a systematization of cetology. I am the\\narchitect, not the builder.\\nBut it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-\\nOffice is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after\\nthem; to have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations,\\nribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I\\nthat I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful\\ntauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a\\ncovenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have\\nswam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do\\nwith whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try.\\nThere are some preliminaries to settle.\\nFirst: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of\\nCetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some\\nquarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In\\nhis System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnæus declares, “I hereby\\nseparate the whales from the fish.” But of my own knowledge, I\\nknow that down to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and\\nherring, against Linnæus’s express edict, were still found dividing the\\npossession of the same seas with the Leviathan.\\nThe grounds upon which Linnæus would fain have banished the\\nwhales from the waters, he states as follows: “On account of their\\nwarm bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow\\nears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” and finally, “ex\\nlege naturæ jure meritoque.” I submitted all this to my friends\\nSimeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of\\nmine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the\\nreasons set forth were altogether insufficient. Charley profanely\\nhinted they were humbug.\\nBe it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old\\nfashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah\\nto back me. This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in\\nwhat internal respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above,\\nLinnæus has given you those items. But in brief, they are these:\\nlungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold\\nblooded.\\nNext: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so\\nas conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short,\\nthen, a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail. There you\\nhave him. However contracted, that definition is the result of\\nexpanded meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the\\nwalrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of\\nthe definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost\\nany one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen\\nhave not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among\\nspouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably\\nassumes a horizontal position.\\nBy the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means\\nexclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto\\nidentified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on\\nthe other hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded\\nas alien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish\\nmust be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come\\nthe grand divisions of the entire whale host.\\n*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled\\nLamatins and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of\\nNantucket) are included by many naturalists among the whales. But\\nas these pig-fish are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the\\nmouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do\\nnot spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented\\nthem with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.\\nFirst: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three\\nprimary BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall\\ncomprehend them all, both small and large.\\nI. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO\\nWHALE.\\nAs the type of the FOLIO I present the Sperm Whale; of the\\nOCTAVO, the Grampus; of the DUODECIMO, the Porpoise.\\nFOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:—I.\\nThe Sperm Whale; II. the Right Whale; III. the Fin-Back Whale; IV. the\\nHump-backed Whale; V. the Razor Back Whale; VI. the Sulphur\\nBottom Whale.\\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER I. (Sperm Whale).—This whale, among\\nthe English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the\\nPhyseter whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot\\nof the French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the\\nMacrocephalus of the Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest\\ninhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of all whales to\\nencounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far the most\\nvaluable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that\\nvaluable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will,\\nin many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name\\nthat I now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some\\ncenturies ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown\\nin his own proper individuality, and when his oil was only\\naccidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days\\nspermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived\\nfrom a creature identical with the one then known in England as the\\nGreenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same\\nspermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale\\nwhich the first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times,\\nalso, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light,\\nbut only as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had\\nfrom the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb.\\nWhen, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of\\nspermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by\\nthe dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely\\nsignificant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at last have\\ncome to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti\\nwas really derived.\\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER II. (Right Whale).—In one respect this is\\nthe most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly\\nhunted by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone\\nor baleen; and the oil specially known as “whale oil,” an inferior\\narticle in commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately\\ndesignated by all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland\\nWhale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right\\nWhale. There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the\\nspecies thus multitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which\\nI include in the second species of my Folios? It is the Great\\nMysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the\\nEnglish whalemen; the Baleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen;\\nthe Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more\\nthan two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English\\nin the Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have\\nlong pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor’\\nWest Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by\\nthem Right Whale Cruising Grounds.\\nSome pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale\\nof the English and the right whale of the Americans. But they\\nprecisely agree in all their grand features; nor has there yet been\\npresented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical\\ndistinction. It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most\\ninconclusive differences, that some departments of natural history\\nbecome so repellingly intricate. The right whale will be elsewhere\\ntreated of at some length, with reference to elucidating the sperm\\nwhale.\\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER III. (Fin-Back).—Under this head I reckon\\na monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and\\nLong-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the\\nwhale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing\\nthe Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains,\\nand in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a\\nless portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great\\nlips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting\\nfolds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from\\nwhich he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is\\nsome three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part\\nof the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed\\nend. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,\\nthis isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the\\nsurface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with\\nspherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts\\nshadows upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that\\nthe watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its\\nstyle and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the\\nshadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems\\na whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going\\nsolitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most\\nsullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall\\nmisanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous\\npower and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from\\nman; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of\\nhis race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back. From having\\nthe baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with\\nthe right whale, among a theoretic species denominated Whalebone\\nwhales, that is, whales with baleen. Of these so called Whalebone\\nwhales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of which,\\nhowever, are little known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales;\\npike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and\\nrostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts.\\nIn connection with this appellative of “Whalebone whales,” it is of\\ngreat importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature\\nmay be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales,\\nyet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan,\\nfounded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth;\\nnotwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously\\nseem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of\\nCetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the\\nwhale, in his kinds, presents. How then? The baleen, hump, back-fin,\\nand teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately\\ndispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard to what\\nmay be the nature of their structure in other and more essential\\nparticulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each\\nhas a hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same\\nhumpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has\\nbaleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the same\\nwith the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales,\\nthey form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of\\nthem detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all\\ngeneral methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every\\none of the whale-naturalists has split.\\nBut it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the\\nwhale, in his anatomy—there, at least, we shall be able to hit the\\nright classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the\\nGreenland whale’s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we\\nhave seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the\\nGreenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various\\nleviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as\\navailable to the systematizer as those external ones already\\nenumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the\\nwhales bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them\\nthat way. And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it\\nis the only one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable.\\nTo proceed.\\nBOOK I. (Folio) CHAPTER IV. (Hump Back).—This whale is often\\nseen on the northern American coast. He has been frequently\\ncaptured there, and towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him\\nlike a peddler; or you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale.\\nAt any rate, the popular name for him does not sufficiently\\ndistinguish him, since the sperm whale also has a hump though a\\nsmaller one. His oil is not very valuable. He has baleen. He is the\\nmost gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more\\ngay foam and white water generally than any other of them.\\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER V. (Razor Back).—Of this whale little is\\nknown but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn.\\nOf a retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers.\\nThough no coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his\\nback, which rises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little\\nmore of him, nor does anybody else.\\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER VI. (Sulphur Bottom).—Another retiring\\ngentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along\\nthe Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom\\nseen; at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern\\nseas, and then always at too great a distance to study his\\ncountenance. He is never chased; he would run away with rope-\\nwalks of line. Prodigies are told of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can\\nsay nothing more that is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.\\nThus ends BOOK I. (Folio), and now begins BOOK II. (Octavo).\\nOCTAVOES.*—These embrace the whales of middling magnitude,\\namong which present may be numbered:—I., the Grampus; II., the\\nBlack Fish; III., the Narwhale; IV., the Thrasher; V., the Killer.\\n*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very\\nplain. Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than\\nthose of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate\\nlikeness to them in figure, yet the bookbinder’s Quarto volume in its\\ndimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume,\\nbut the Octavo volume does.\\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER I. (Grampus).—Though this fish,\\nwhose loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a\\nproverb to landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is\\nhe not popularly classed among whales. But possessing all the\\ngrand distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have\\nrecognised him for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from\\nfifteen to twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding\\ndimensions round the waist. He swims in herds; he is never regularly\\nhunted, though his oil is considerable in quantity, and pretty good\\nfor light. By some fishermen his approach is regarded as\\npremonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.\\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER II. (Black Fish).—I give the popular\\nfishermen’s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.\\nWhere any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say\\nso, and suggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-\\ncalled, because blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So,\\ncall him the Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known,\\nand from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are\\ncurved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on\\nhis face. This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in\\nlength. He is found in almost all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of\\nshowing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something\\nlike a Roman nose. When not more profitably employed, the sperm\\nwhale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to keep up the\\nsupply of cheap oil for domestic employment—as some frugal\\nhousekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by\\nthemselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax. Though\\ntheir blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you\\nupwards of thirty gallons of oil.\\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER III. (Narwhale), that is, Nostril whale.\\n—Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I\\nsuppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a\\npeaked nose. The creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its\\nhorn averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to\\nfifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk,\\ngrowing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the\\nhorizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill\\neffect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a\\nclumsy left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn or\\nlance answers, it would be hard to say. It does not seem to be used\\nlike the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors\\ntell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the\\nbottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an\\nice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea,\\nand finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks\\nthrough. But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be\\ncorrect. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may\\nreally be used by the Narwhale—however that may be—it would\\ncertainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading\\npamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the\\nHorned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious\\nexample of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of\\nanimated nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have\\ngathered that this same sea-unicorn’s horn was in ancient days\\nregarded as the great antidote against poison, and as such,\\npreparations of it brought immense prices. It was also distilled to a\\nvolatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way that the horns of the\\nmale deer are manufactured into hartshorn. Originally it was in itself\\naccounted an object of great curiosity. Black Letter tells me that Sir\\nMartin Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess\\ndid gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of\\nGreenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; “when\\nSir Martin returned from that voyage,” saith Black Letter, “on bended\\nknees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the\\nNarwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle at\\nWindsor.” An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended\\nknees, did likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining\\nto a land beast of the unicorn nature.\\nThe Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a\\nmilk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of\\nblack. His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it,\\nand he is seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar\\nseas.\\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER IV. (Killer).—Of this whale little is\\nprecisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the\\nprofessed naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I\\nshould say that he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very\\nsavage—a sort of Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio\\nwhales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute\\nis worried to death. The Killer is never hunted. I never heard what\\nsort of oil he has. Exception might be taken to the name bestowed\\nupon this whale, on the ground of its indistinctness. For we are all\\nkillers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.\\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER V. (Thrasher).—This gentleman is\\nfamous for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes.\\nHe mounts the Folio whale’s back, and as he swims, he works his\\npassage by flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the\\nworld by a similar process. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of\\nthe Killer. Both are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.\\nThus ends BOOK II. (Octavo), and begins BOOK III. (Duodecimo).\\nDUODECIMOES.—These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza\\nPorpoise. II. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.\\nTo those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it\\nmay possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding\\nfour or five feet should be marshalled among WHALES—a word,\\nwhich, in the popular sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness.\\nBut the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly\\nwhales, by the terms of my definition of what a whale is—i.e. a\\nspouting fish, with a horizontal tail.\\nBOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER 1. (Huzza Porpoise).—This is the\\ncommon porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of\\nmy own bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises,\\nand something must be done to distinguish them. I call him thus,\\nbecause he always swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad\\nsea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July\\ncrowd. Their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the\\nmariner. Full of fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy\\nbillows to windward. They are the lads that always live before the\\nwind. They are accounted a lucky omen. If you yourself can\\nwithstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then\\nheaven help ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye. A\\nwell-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of\\ngood oil. But the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is\\nexceedingly valuable. It is in request among jewellers and\\nwatchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise meat is good\\neating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that a porpoise\\nspouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very readily\\ndiscernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and\\nyou will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.\\nBOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER II. (Algerine Porpoise).—A pirate.\\nVery savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat\\nlarger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general\\nmake. Provoke him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for\\nhim many times, but never yet saw him captured.\\nBOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER III. (Mealy-mouthed Porpoise).—\\nThe largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as\\nit is known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been\\ndesignated, is that of the fishers—Right-Whale Porpoise, from the\\ncircumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In\\nshape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of\\na less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and\\ngentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other\\nporpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of\\na hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back\\ndown to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct\\nas the mark in a ship’s hull, called the “bright waist,” that line streaks\\nhim from stem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and\\nwhite below. The white comprises part of his head, and the whole of\\nhis mouth, which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a\\nfelonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His\\noil is much like that of the common porpoise.\\n* * * * * *\\nBeyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch\\nas the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all\\nthe Leviathans of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,\\nhalf-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by\\nreputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate them by their fore-\\ncastle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to future\\ninvestigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If any\\nof the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then\\nhe can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his\\nFolio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:—The Bottle-Nose Whale;\\nthe Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the\\nLeading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered\\nWhale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the\\nBlue Whale; etc. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities,\\nthere might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with\\nall manner of uncouth names. But I omit them as altogether\\nobsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full\\nof Leviathanism, but signifying nothing.\\nFinally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be\\nhere, and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have\\nkept my word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus\\nunfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the\\ncrane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For\\nsmall erections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones,\\ntrue ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from\\never completing anything. This whole book is but a draught—nay,\\nbut the draught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and\\nPatience!\\nCHAPTER 33. The\\nSpecksnyder.\\nConcerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a\\nplace as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board,\\narising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class\\nunknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\\nThe large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is\\nevinced by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two\\ncenturies and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not\\nwholly lodged in the person now called the captain, but was divided\\nbetween him and an officer called the Specksnyder. Literally this\\nword means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent\\nto Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the captain’s authority was\\nrestricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel;\\nwhile over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the\\nSpecksnyder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In the British\\nGreenland Fishery, under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old\\nDutch official is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly\\nabridged. At present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as\\nsuch, is but one of the captain’s more inferior subalterns.\\nNevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the\\nsuccess of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since in the\\nAmerican Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat, but\\nunder certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground)\\nthe command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the grand\\npolitical maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live\\napart from the men before the mast, and be in some way\\ndistinguished as their professional superior; though always, by them,\\nfamiliarly regarded as their social equal.\\nNow, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea,\\nis this—the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and\\nmerchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain;\\nand so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are\\nlodged in the after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their\\nmeals in the captain’s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly\\ncommunicating with it.\\nThough the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the\\nlongest of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils\\nof it, and the community of interest prevailing among a company, all\\nof whom, high or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed\\nwages, but upon their common luck, together with their common\\nvigilance, intrepidity, and hard work; though all these things do in\\nsome cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in\\nmerchantmen generally; yet, never mind how much like an old\\nMesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some primitive\\ninstances, live together; for all that, the punctilious externals, at\\nleast, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed, and in no\\ninstance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in which\\nyou will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated\\ngrandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost\\nas much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not\\nthe shabbiest of pilot-cloth.\\nAnd though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the\\nleast given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the\\nonly homage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous\\nobedience; though he required no man to remove the shoes from\\nhis feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and though there were\\ntimes when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events\\nhereafter to be detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms,\\nwhether of condescension or in terrorem, or otherwise; yet even\\nCaptain Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount\\nforms and usages of the sea.\\nNor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind\\nthose forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;\\nincidentally making use of them for other and more private ends\\nthan they were legitimately intended to subserve. That certain\\nsultanism of his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree\\nremained unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism\\nbecame incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship. For be a man’s\\nintellectual superiority what it will, it can never assume the practical,\\navailable supremacy over other men, without the aid of some sort\\nof external arts and entrenchments, always, in themselves, more or\\nless paltry and base. This it is, that for ever keeps God’s true princes\\nof the Empire from the world’s hustings; and leaves the highest\\nhonors that this air can give, to those men who become famous\\nmore through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful\\nof the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over\\nthe dead level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks in these small\\nthings when extreme political superstitions invest them, that in\\nsome royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted\\npotency. But when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed\\ncrown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the\\nplebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization.\\nNor, \\nwill \\nthe \\ntragic \\ndramatist \\nwho \\nwould \\ndepict \\nmortal\\nindomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing, ever forget a\\nhint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one now alluded to.\\nBut Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket\\ngrimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors\\nand Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old\\nwhale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical\\ntrappings and housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be\\ngrand in thee, it must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived\\nfor in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!\\nCHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.\\nIt is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-\\nbread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and\\nmaster; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an\\nobservation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on\\nthe smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily\\npurpose on the upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete\\ninattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had\\nnot heard his menial. But presently, catching hold of the mizen\\nshrouds, he swings himself to the deck, and in an even,\\nunexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,” disappears into\\nthe cabin.\\nWhen the last echo of his sultan’s step has died away, and\\nStarbuck, the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is\\nseated, then Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns\\nalong the planks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says,\\nwith some touch of pleasantness, “Dinner, Mr. Stubb,” and descends\\nthe scuttle. The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and\\nthen slightly shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all\\nright with that important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden,\\nand with a rapid “Dinner, Mr. Flask,” follows after his predecessors.\\nBut the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-\\ndeck, seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping\\nall sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off\\nhis shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe\\nright over the Grand Turk’s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight,\\npitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down\\nrollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck,\\nreversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music.\\nBut ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a\\nnew face altogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little Flask\\nenters King Ahab’s presence, in the character of Abjectus, or the\\nSlave.\\nIt is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\\nartificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck\\nsome officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and\\ndefyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let\\nthose very officers the next moment go down to their customary\\ndinner in that same commander’s cabin, and straightway their\\ninoffensive, not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as\\nhe sits at the head of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most\\ncomical. Wherefore this difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have\\nbeen Belshazzar, King of Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not\\nhaughtily but courteously, therein certainly must have been some\\ntouch of mundane grandeur. But he who in the rightly regal and\\nintelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table of invited\\nguests, that man’s unchallenged power and dominion of individual\\ninfluence for the time; that man’s royalty of state transcends\\nBelshazzar’s, for Belshazzar was not the greatest. Who has but once\\ndined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Cæsar. It is a witchery\\nof social czarship which there is no withstanding. Now, if to this\\nconsideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master,\\nthen, by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of\\nsea-life just mentioned.\\nOver his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-\\nlion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still\\ndeferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be\\nserved. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,\\nthere seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one\\nmind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man’s knife, as he\\ncarved the chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the\\nworld they would have profaned that moment with the slightest\\nobservation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And\\nwhen reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of\\nbeef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck’s plate towards\\nhim, the mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it\\ntenderly; and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against\\nthe plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without\\ncircumspection. For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where\\nthe German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial\\nElectors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten\\nin awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation;\\nonly he himself was dumb. What a relief it was to choking Stubb,\\nwhen a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below. And poor little\\nFlask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family\\nparty. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have\\nbeen the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help himself,\\nthis must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first\\ndegree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more\\nwould he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\\nnevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask\\nhelped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as\\nnoticed it. Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter.\\nWhether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on\\naccount of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he\\ndeemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter\\nwas at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern;\\nhowever it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!\\nAnother thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and\\nFlask is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask’s dinner was\\nbadly jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the\\nstart of him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the\\nrear. If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to\\nhave but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding\\nhis repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than\\nthree mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to\\nprecede Flask to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted\\nin private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer,\\nfrom that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise\\nthan hungry, more or less. For what he ate did not so much relieve\\nhis hunger, as keep it immortal in him. Peace and satisfaction,\\nthought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach. I am an\\nofficer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the\\nforecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast. There’s the\\nfruits of promotion now; there’s the vanity of glory: there’s the\\ninsanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the\\nPequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask’s official capacity, all that\\nsailor had to do, in order to obtain ample vengeance, was to go aft\\nat dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask through the cabin sky-light,\\nsitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab.\\nNow, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the\\nfirst table in the Pequod’s cabin. After their departure, taking place\\nin inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or\\nrather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward.\\nAnd then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they\\nbeing its residuary legatees. They made a sort of temporary\\nservants’ hall of the high and mighty cabin.\\nIn strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and\\nnameless invisible domineerings of the captain’s table, was the\\nentire care-free license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of\\nthose inferior fellows the harpooneers. While their masters, the\\nmates, seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws,\\nthe harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was\\na report to it. They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like\\nIndian ships all day loading with spices. Such portentous appetites\\nhad Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by\\nthe previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on\\na great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox.\\nAnd if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nimble\\nhop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of\\naccelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And\\nonce Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy’s\\nmemory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a\\ngreat empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began\\nlaying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a\\nvery nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced\\nsteward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And\\nwhat with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the\\nperiodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-\\nBoy’s whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after\\nseeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he\\nwould escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and\\nfearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was\\nover.\\nIt was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego,\\nopposing his filed teeth to the Indian’s: crosswise to them, Daggoo\\nseated on the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-\\nplumed head to the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal\\nlimbs, making the low cabin framework to shake, as when an African\\nelephant goes passenger in a ship. But for all this, the great negro\\nwas wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty. It seemed hardly\\npossible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep\\nup the vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a\\nperson. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep\\nof the abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils\\nsnuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by beef or by bread,\\nare giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal,\\nbarbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so\\nmuch so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see\\nwhether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when\\nhe would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that\\nhis bones might be picked, the simple-witted steward all but\\nshattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry, by his\\nsudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the whetstone which the\\nharpooneers carried in their pockets, for their lances and other\\nweapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they would\\nostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at all\\ntend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in\\nhis Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty\\nof some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard\\nfares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin\\nshould he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to\\nhis great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart;\\nto his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones\\njingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.\\nBut, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally\\nlived there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they\\nwere scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before\\nsleeping-time, when they passed through it to their own peculiar\\nquarters.\\nIn this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American\\nwhale captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by\\nrights the ship’s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy\\nalone that anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in\\nreal truth, the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more\\nproperly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when\\nthey did enter it, it was something as a street-door enters a house;\\nturning inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and,\\nas a permanent thing, residing in the open air. Nor did they lose\\nmuch hereby; in the cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab\\nwas inaccessible. Though nominally included in the census of\\nChristendom, he was still an alien to it. He lived in the world, as the\\nlast of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri. And as when Spring\\nand Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying\\nhimself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking\\nhis own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab’s soul,\\nshut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen\\npaws of its gloom!\\nCHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.\\nIt was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with\\nthe other seamen my first mast-head came round.\\nIn most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\\nsimultaneously with the vessel’s leaving her port; even though she\\nmay have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her\\nproper cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years’\\nvoyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her—say,\\nan empty vial even—then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the\\nlast; and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the\\nport, does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one\\nwhale more.\\nNow, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is\\na very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\\nhere. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old\\nEgyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.\\nFor though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless,\\nby their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all\\nAsia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that\\ngreat stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board,\\nin the dread gale of God’s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these\\nBabel builders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians\\nwere a nation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the\\ngeneral belief among archæologists, that the first pyramids were\\nfounded for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported\\nby the peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices;\\nwhereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old\\nastronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new\\nstars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or\\na whale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian\\nhermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert\\nand spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting\\nhis food from the ground with a tackle; in him we have a\\nremarkable instance of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was\\nnot to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet;\\nbut valiantly facing everything out to the last, literally died at his\\npost. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set;\\nmere stone, iron, and bronze men; who, though well capable of\\nfacing out a stiff gale, are still entirely incompetent to the business\\nof singing out upon discovering any strange sight. There is\\nNapoleon; who, upon the top of the column of Vendome, stands\\nwith arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air;\\ncareless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe,\\nLouis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high\\naloft on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of\\nHercules’ pillars, his column marks that point of human grandeur\\nbeyond which few mortals will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a\\ncapstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and\\never when most obscured by that London smoke, token is yet given\\nthat a hidden hero is there; for where there is smoke, must be fire.\\nBut neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor Nelson, will\\nanswer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to befriend\\nby their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;\\nhowever it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the\\nthick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks\\nmust be shunned.\\nIt may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-\\nhead standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it\\nis not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the\\nsole historian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed\\ntells us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were\\nregularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island\\nerected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs\\nascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs\\nin a hen-house. A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the\\nBay whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game,\\ngave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach. But this\\ncustom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper\\nmast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are\\nkept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their\\nregular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other every two\\nhours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant\\nthe mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful.\\nThere you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding\\nalong the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath\\nyou and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of\\nthe sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous\\nColossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of\\nthe sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship\\nindolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves\\nyou into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a\\nsublime uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no\\ngazettes; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never\\ndelude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic\\nafflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with\\nthe thought of what you shall have for dinner—for all your meals\\nfor three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill\\nof fare is immutable.\\nIn one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four\\nyears’ voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you\\nspend at the mast-head would amount to several entire months.\\nAnd it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote\\nso considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life,\\nshould be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy\\ninhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of\\nfeeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry\\nbox, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small and snug\\ncontrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your most\\nusual point of perch is the head of the t’ gallant-mast, where you\\nstand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen)\\ncalled the t’ gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the\\nbeginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull’s horns.\\nTo be sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with\\nyou, in the shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the\\nthickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body; for\\nas the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely\\nmove about in it, nor even move out of it, without running great\\nrisk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in\\nwinter); so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere\\nenvelope, or additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or\\nchest of drawers in your body, and no more can you make a\\nconvenient closet of your watch-coat.\\nConcerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads\\nof a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little\\ntents or pulpits, called crow’s-nests, in which the look-outs of a\\nGreenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the\\nfrozen seas. In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled “A\\nVoyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and\\nincidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old\\nGreenland;” in this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are\\nfurnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then\\nrecently invented crow’s-nest of the Glacier, which was the name of\\nCaptain Sleet’s good craft. He called it the Sleet’s crow’s-nest, in\\nhonor of himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and\\nfree from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our\\nown children after our own names (we fathers being the original\\ninventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after\\nourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet’s\\ncrow’s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe; it is open above,\\nhowever, where it is furnished with a movable side-screen to keep to\\nwindward of your head in a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of\\nthe mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in the\\nbottom. On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship, is a\\ncomfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas,\\ncomforters, and coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep\\nyour speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical\\nconveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in\\nthis crow’s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him\\n(also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot, for\\nthe purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea\\nunicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at\\nthem from the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to\\nshoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly\\na labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the little\\ndetailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest; but though he so enlarges\\nupon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific\\naccount of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small compass\\nhe kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting\\nfrom what is called the “local attraction” of all binnacle magnets; an\\nerror ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship’s\\nplanks, and in the Glacier’s case, perhaps, to there having been so\\nmany broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though\\nthe Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his\\nlearned “binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass observations,” and\\n“approximate errors,” he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was\\nnot so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as\\nto fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished\\nlittle case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow’s nest,\\nwithin easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly\\nadmire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain;\\nyet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that\\ncase-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have\\nbeen, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was\\nstudying the mathematics aloft there in that bird’s nest within three\\nor four perches of the pole.\\nBut if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as\\nCaptain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is\\ngreatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those\\nseductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I\\nused to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to\\nhave a chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might\\nfind there; then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy\\nleg over the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery\\npastures, and so at last mount to my ultimate destination.\\nLet me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I\\nkept but sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in\\nme, how could I—being left completely to myself at such a thought-\\nengendering altitude—how could I but lightly hold my obligations\\nto observe all whale-ships’ standing orders, “Keep your weather eye\\nopen, and sing out every time.”\\nAnd let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners\\nof Nantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad\\nwith \\nlean \\nbrow \\nand \\nhollow \\neye; \\ngiven \\nto \\nunseasonable\\nmeditativeness; and who offers to ship with the Phædon instead of\\nBowditch in his head. Beware of such an one, I say; your whales\\nmust be seen before they can be killed; and this sunken-eyed young\\nPlatonist will tow you ten wakes round the world, and never make\\nyou one pint of sperm the richer. Nor are these monitions at all\\nunneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for\\nmany romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded young men,\\ndisgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking sentiment in\\ntar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself\\nupon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship, and\\nin moody phrase ejaculates:—\\n      “Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!\\n      Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.”\\nVery often do the captains of such ships take those absent-\\nminded young philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not\\nfeeling sufficient “interest” in the voyage; half-hinting that they are\\nso hopelessly lost to all honorable ambition, as that in their secret\\nsouls they would rather not see whales than otherwise. But all in\\nvain; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is\\nimperfect; they are short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual\\nnerve? They have left their opera-glasses at home.\\n“Why, thou monkey,” said a harpooneer to one of these lads,\\n“we’ve been cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not\\nraised a whale yet. Whales are scarce as hen’s teeth whenever thou\\nart up here.” Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been\\nshoals of them in the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like\\nlistlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded\\nyouth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last\\nhe loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the\\nvisible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading\\nmankind and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful\\nthing that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some\\nundiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive\\nthoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it.\\nIn this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came;\\nbecomes diffused through time and space; like Cranmer’s sprinkled\\nPantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round\\nglobe over.\\nThere is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by\\na gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea,\\nfrom the inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is\\non ye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and\\nyour identity comes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you\\nhover. And perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-\\nthrottled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the\\nsummer sea, no more to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!\\nCHAPTER 36. The Quarter-\\nDeck.\\n(Enter Ahab: Then, all.)\\nIt was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one\\nmorning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended\\nthe cabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually\\nwalk at that hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a\\nfew turns in the garden.\\nSoon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his\\nold rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all\\nover dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his\\nwalk. Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow;\\nthere also, you would see still stranger foot-prints—the foot-prints\\nof his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.\\nBut on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even\\nas his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of\\nhis thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now\\nat the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see\\nthat thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced;\\nso completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the\\ninward mould of every outer movement.\\n“D’ye mark him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s in him\\npecks the shell. ’Twill soon be out.”\\nThe hours wore on;—Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon,\\npacing the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his\\naspect.\\nIt drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the\\nbulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and\\nwith one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send\\neverybody aft.\\n“Sir!” said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given\\non ship-board except in some extraordinary case.\\n“Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, there! come\\ndown!”\\nWhen the entire ship’s company were assembled, and with curious\\nand not wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he\\nlooked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up,\\nAhab, after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his\\neyes among the crew, started from his standpoint; and as though\\nnot a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck.\\nWith bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to pace,\\nunmindful of the wondering whispering among the men; till Stubb\\ncautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have summoned\\nthem there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat. But this\\ndid not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:—\\n“What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”\\n“Sing out for him!” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of\\nclubbed voices.\\n“Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing\\nthe hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so\\nmagnetically thrown them.\\n“And what do ye next, men?”\\n“Lower away, and after him!”\\n“And what tune is it ye pull to, men?”\\n“A dead whale or a stove boat!”\\nMore and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew\\nthe countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners\\nbegan to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was\\nthat they themselves became so excited at such seemingly\\npurposeless questions.\\nBut, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in\\nhis pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and\\ntightly, almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:—\\n“All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about\\na white whale. Look ye! d’ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?”—\\nholding up a broad bright coin to the sun—“it is a sixteen dollar\\npiece, men. D’ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.”\\nWhile the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking,\\nwas slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as\\nif to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was\\nmeanwhile lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so\\nstrangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical\\nhumming of the wheels of his vitality in him.\\nReceiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the\\nmain-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the\\ngold with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming:\\n“Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled\\nbrow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-\\nheaded whale, with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke—\\nlook ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, he shall\\nhave this gold ounce, my boys!”\\n“Huzza! huzza!” cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they\\nhailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.\\n“It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab, as he threw down the\\ntopmaul: “a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for\\nwhite water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.”\\nAll this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on\\nwith even more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at\\nthe mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started\\nas if each was separately touched by some specific recollection.\\n“Captain Ahab,” said Tashtego, “that white whale must be the\\nsame that some call Moby Dick.”\\n“Moby Dick?” shouted Ahab. “Do ye know the white whale then,\\nTash?”\\n“Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?” said\\nthe Gay-Header deliberately.\\n“And has he a curious spout, too,” said Daggoo, “very bushy, even\\nfor a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?”\\n“And he have one, two, three—oh! good many iron in him hide,\\ntoo, Captain,” cried Queequeg disjointedly, “all twiske-tee be-twisk,\\nlike him—him—” faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand\\nround and round as though uncorking a bottle—“like him—him—”\\n“Corkscrew!” cried Ahab, “aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all\\ntwisted and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one,\\nlike a whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket\\nwool after the great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he\\nfan-tails like a split jib in a squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby\\nDick ye have seen—Moby Dick—Moby Dick!”\\n“Captain Ahab,” said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had\\nthus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last\\nseemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the\\nwonder. “Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick—but it was not\\nMoby Dick that took off thy leg?”\\n“Who told thee that?” cried Ahab; then pausing, “Aye, Starbuck;\\naye, my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me;\\nMoby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now.\\nAye, aye,” he shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a\\nheart-stricken moose; “Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale\\nthat razed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a\\nday!” Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he\\nshouted out: “Aye, aye! and I’ll chase him round Good Hope, and\\nround the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round\\nperdition’s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have\\nshipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land,\\nand over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin\\nout. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do\\nlook brave.”\\n“Aye, aye!” shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer\\nto the excited old man: “A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp\\nlance for Moby Dick!”\\n“God bless ye,” he seemed to half sob and half shout. “God bless\\nye, men. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what’s\\nthis long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white\\nwhale? art not game for Moby Dick?”\\n“I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too,\\nCaptain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow;\\nbut I came here to hunt whales, not my commander’s vengeance.\\nHow many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest\\nit, Captain Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket\\nmarket.”\\n“Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou\\nrequirest a little lower layer. If money’s to be the measurer, man, and\\nthe accountants have computed their great counting-house the\\nglobe, by girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an\\ninch; then, let me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great\\npremium here!”\\n“He smites his chest,” whispered Stubb, “what’s that for? methinks\\nit rings most vast, but hollow.”\\n“Vengeance on a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, “that simply smote\\nthee from blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb\\nthing, Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.”\\n“Hark ye yet again—the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,\\nare but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act,\\nthe undoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning\\nthing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the\\nunreasoning mask. If man will strike, strike through the mask! How\\ncan the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?\\nTo me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I\\nthink there’s naught beyond. But ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps\\nme; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice\\nsinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the\\nwhite whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that\\nhate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I’d strike the sun\\nif it insulted me. For could the sun do that, then could I do the\\nother; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy presiding\\nover all creations. But not my master, man, is even that fair play.\\nWho’s over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off thine eye! more\\nintolerable than fiends’ glarings is a doltish stare! So, so; thou\\nreddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow. But\\nlook ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself. There\\nare men from whom warm words are small indignity. I meant not to\\nincense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted\\ntawn—living, breathing pictures painted by the sun. The Pagan\\nleopards—the unrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and\\nseek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel! The crew,\\nman, the crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of\\nthe whale? See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to\\nthink of it. Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one tost\\nsapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. ’Tis but to help\\nstrike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From\\nthis one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely\\nhe will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a\\nwhetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee!\\nSpeak, but speak!—Aye, aye! thy silence, then, that voices thee.\\n(Aside) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in\\nhis lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without\\nrebellion.”\\n“God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured Starbuck, lowly.\\nBut in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate,\\nAhab did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh\\nfrom the hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the\\ncordage; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as\\nfor a moment their hearts sank in. For again Starbuck’s downcast\\neyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life; the subterranean\\nlaugh died away; the winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship\\nheaved and rolled as before. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why\\nstay ye not when ye come? But rather are ye predictions than\\nwarnings, ye shadows! Yet not so much predictions from without, as\\nverifications of the foregoing things within. For with little external to\\nconstrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, these still drive\\nus on.\\n“The measure! the measure!” cried Ahab.\\nReceiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers,\\nhe ordered them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them\\nbefore him near the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands,\\nwhile his three mates stood at his side with their lances, and the\\nrest of the ship’s company formed a circle round the group; he\\nstood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But\\nthose wild eyes met his, as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves\\nmeet the eye of their leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the\\ntrail of the bison; but, alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the\\nIndian.\\n“Drink and pass!” he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to\\nthe nearest seaman. “The crew alone now drink. Round with it,\\nround! Short draughts—long swallows, men; ’tis hot as Satan’s hoof.\\nSo, so; it goes round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the\\nserpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went,\\nthis way it comes. Hand it me—here’s a hollow! Men, ye seem the\\nyears; so brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!\\n“Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan;\\nand ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand\\nthere with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may\\nin some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before\\nme. O men, you will yet see that—Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies\\ncome not sooner. Hand it me. Why, now, this pewter had run\\nbrimming again, wer’t not thou St. Vitus’ imp—away, thou ague!\\n“Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done!\\nLet me touch the axis.” So saying, with extended arm, he grasped\\nthe three level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so\\ndoing, suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing\\nintently from Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as\\nthough, by some nameless, interior volition, he would fain have\\nshocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the\\nLeyden jar of his own magnetic life. The three mates quailed before\\nhis strong, sustained, and mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked\\nsideways from him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright.\\n“In vain!” cried Ahab; “but, maybe, ’tis well. For did ye three but\\nonce take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, that\\nhad perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have\\ndropped ye dead. Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now,\\nye mates, I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan\\nkinsmen \\nthere—yon \\nthree \\nmost \\nhonorable \\ngentlemen \\nand\\nnoblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain the task? What, when\\nthe great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using his tiara for ewer?\\nOh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension, that shall bend ye\\nto it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your seizings and draw the\\npoles, ye harpooneers!”\\nSilently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with\\nthe detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long,\\nheld, barbs up, before him.\\n“Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over!\\nknow ye not the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye\\ncup-bearers, advance. The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!”\\nForthwith, slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed\\nthe harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.\\n“Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices!\\nBestow them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble\\nleague. Ha! Starbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now\\nwaits to sit upon it. Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men\\nthat man the deathful whaleboat’s bow—Death to Moby Dick! God\\nhunt us all, if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death!” The long,\\nbarbed steel goblets were lifted; and to cries and maledictions\\nagainst the white whale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed\\ndown with a hiss. Starbuck paled, and turned, and shivered. Once\\nmore, and finally, the replenished pewter went the rounds among\\nthe frantic crew; when, waving his free hand to them, they all\\ndispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.\\nCHAPTER 37. Sunset.\\nThe cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing\\nout.\\nI leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks,\\nwhere’er I sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my\\ntrack; let them; but first I pass.\\nYonder, by ever-brimming goblet’s rim, the warm waves blush like\\nwine. The gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun—slow dived\\nfrom noon—goes down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her\\nendless hill. Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron\\nCrown of Lombardy. Yet is it bright with many a gem; I the wearer,\\nsee not its far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that\\ndazzlingly confounds. ’Tis iron—that I know—not gold. ’Tis split, too\\n—that I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat\\nagainst the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs no\\nhelmet in the most brain-battering fight!\\nDry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly\\nspurred me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it\\nlights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne’er enjoy.\\nGifted with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power;\\ndamned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of\\nParadise! Good night—good night! (waving his hand, he moves\\nfrom the window.)\\n’Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the\\nleast; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and\\nthey revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all\\nstand before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the\\nmatch itself must needs be wasting! What I’ve dared, I’ve willed; and\\nwhat I’ve willed, I’ll do! They think me mad—Starbuck does; but I’m\\ndemoniac, I am madness maddened! That wild madness that’s only\\ncalm to comprehend itself! The prophecy was that I should be\\ndismembered; and—Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will\\ndismember my dismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet and the\\nfulfiller one. That’s more than ye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh\\nand hoot at ye, ye cricket-players, ye pugilists, ye deaf Burkes and\\nblinded Bendigoes! I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies—Take\\nsome one of your own size; don’t pommel me! No, ye’ve knocked\\nme down, and I am up again; but ye have run and hidden. Come\\nforth from behind your cotton bags! I have no long gun to reach ye.\\nCome, Ahab’s compliments to ye; come and see if ye can swerve\\nme. Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve yourselves!\\nman has ye there. Swerve me? The path to my fixed purpose is laid\\nwith iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run. Over unsounded\\ngorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under torrents’ beds,\\nunerringly I rush! Naught’s an obstacle, naught’s an angle to the\\niron way!\\nCHAPTER 38. Dusk.\\nBy the Mainmast; Starbuck leaning against it.\\nMy soul is more than matched; she’s overmanned; and by a\\nmadman! Insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such\\na field! But he drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of\\nme! I think I see his impious end; but feel that I must help him to it.\\nWill I, nill I, the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a\\ncable I have no knife to cut. Horrible old man! Who’s over him, he\\ncries;—aye, he would be a democrat to all above; look, how he\\nlords it over all below! Oh! I plainly see my miserable office,—to\\nobey, rebelling; and worse yet, to hate with touch of pity! For in his\\neyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is there\\nhope. Time and tide flow wide. The hated whale has the round\\nwatery world to swim in, as the small gold-fish has its glassy globe.\\nHis heaven-insulting purpose, God may wedge aside. I would up\\nheart, were it not like lead. But my whole clock’s run down; my\\nheart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to lift again.\\n[A burst of revelry from the forecastle.]\\nOh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch\\nof human mothers in them! Whelped somewhere by the sharkish\\nsea. The white whale is their demigorgon. Hark! the infernal orgies!\\nthat revelry is forward! mark the unfaltering silence aft! Methinks it\\npictures life. Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay,\\nembattled, bantering bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it,\\nwhere he broods within his sternward cabin, builded over the dead\\nwater of the wake, and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings.\\nThe long howl thrills me through! Peace! ye revellers, and set the\\nwatch! Oh, life! ’tis in an hour like this, with soul beat down and\\nheld to knowledge,—as wild, untutored things are forced to feed—\\nOh, life! ’tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee! but ’tis not\\nme! that horror’s out of me! and with the soft feeling of the human\\nin me, yet will I try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand by\\nme, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences!\\nCHAPTER 39. First Night-\\nWatch.\\nFore-Top.\\n(Stubb solus, and mending a brace.)\\nHa! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!—I’ve been thinking over it\\never since, and that ha, ha’s the final consequence. Why so? Because\\na laugh’s the wisest, easiest answer to all that’s queer; and come\\nwhat will, one comfort’s always left—that unfailing comfort is, it’s all\\npredestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor\\neye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be\\nsure the old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had\\nthe gift, might readily have prophesied it—for when I clapped my\\neye upon his skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, wise Stubb—that’s my title—\\nwell, Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here’s a carcase. I know not all that\\nmay be coming, but be it what it will, I’ll go to it laughing. Such a\\nwaggish leering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra,\\nskirra! What’s my juicy little pear at home doing now? Crying its\\neyes out?—Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say,\\ngay as a frigate’s pennant, and so am I—fa, la! lirra, skirra! Oh—\\n      We’ll drink to-night with hearts as light,\\n         To love, as gay and fleeting\\n      As bubbles that swim, on the beaker’s brim,\\n         And break on the lips while meeting.\\nA brave stave that—who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir—(Aside)\\nhe’s my superior, he has his too, if I’m not mistaken.—Aye, aye, sir,\\njust through with this job—coming.\\nCHAPTER 40.

Fine prospects\\nto ’em; they’re on the road to heaven. Hold on hard! Jimmini, what a\\nsquall! But those chaps there are worse yet—they are your white\\nsqualls, they. White squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr! Here have I\\nheard all their chat just now, and the white whale—shirr! shirr!—but\\nspoken of once! and only this evening—it makes me jingle all over\\nlike my tambourine—that anaconda of an old man swore ’em in to\\nhunt him! Oh, thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon\\ndarkness, have mercy on this small black boy down here; preserve\\nhim from all men that have no bowels to feel fear!\\nCHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.\\nI, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the\\nrest; my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted,\\nand more did I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in\\nmy soul. A wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab’s\\nquenchless feud seemed mine. With greedy ears I learned the\\nhistory of that murderous monster against whom I and all the\\nothers had taken our oaths of violence and revenge.\\nFor some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,\\nsecluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly\\nfrequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew\\nof his existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly\\nseen him; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly\\ngiven battle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large\\nnumber of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled\\nover the entire watery circumference, many of them adventurously\\npushing their quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never\\nfor a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a\\nsingle news-telling sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each\\nseparate voyage; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home;\\nall these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect, long\\nobstructed the spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet\\nof the special individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was\\nhardly to be doubted, that several vessels reported to have\\nencountered, at such or such a time, or on such or such a meridian,\\na Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity, which\\nwhale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had completely\\nescaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I\\nsay, that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby\\nDick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by\\nvarious and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and\\nmalice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by\\naccident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters,\\nperhaps, for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar\\nterror he bred, more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale\\nfishery at large, than to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the\\ndisastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto\\nbeen popularly regarded.\\nAnd as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by\\nchance caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had\\nevery one of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him,\\nas for any other whale of that species. But at length, such calamities\\ndid ensue in these assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists and\\nankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations—but fatal to the\\nlast degree of fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all\\naccumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things\\nhad gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to\\nwhom the story of the White Whale had eventually come.\\nNor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the\\nmore horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not\\nonly do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all\\nsurprising terrible events,—as the smitten tree gives birth to its\\nfungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild\\nrumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to\\ncling to. And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the\\nwhale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the\\nwonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes\\ncirculate there. For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt\\nfrom that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors;\\nbut of all sailors, they are by all odds the most directly brought into\\ncontact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to\\nface they not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give\\nbattle to them. Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you\\nsailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would\\nnot come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath\\nthat part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too\\nsuch a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences\\nall tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth.\\nNo wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere\\ntransit over the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the\\nWhite Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner\\nof morbid hints, and half-formed fœtal suggestions of supernatural\\nagencies, which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors\\nunborrowed from anything that visibly appears. So that in many\\ncases such a panic did he finally strike, that few who by those\\nrumors, at least, had heard of the White Whale, few of those\\nhunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw.\\nBut there were still other and more vital practical influences at\\nwork. Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the\\nSperm Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the\\nleviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There\\nare those this day among them, who, though intelligent and\\ncourageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right\\nwhale, would perhaps—either from professional inexperience, or\\nincompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale;\\nat any rate, there are plenty of whalemen, especially among those\\nwhaling nations not sailing under the American flag, who have\\nnever hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole\\nknowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster\\nprimitively pursued in the North; seated on their hatches, these men\\nwill hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe, to the wild,\\nstrange tales of Southern whaling. Nor is the pre-eminent\\ntremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly\\ncomprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.\\nAnd as if the now tested reality of his might had in former\\nlegendary times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book\\nnaturalists—Olassen and Povelson—declaring the Sperm Whale not\\nonly to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but\\nalso to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for\\nhuman blood. Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were\\nthese or almost similar impressions effaced. For in his Natural\\nHistory, the Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale,\\nall fish (sharks included) are “struck with the most lively terrors,” and\\n“often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the\\nrocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death.” And\\nhowever the general experiences in the fishery may amend such\\nreports as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the\\nbloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in\\nsome vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the\\nhunters.\\nSo that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him,\\nnot a few of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the\\nearlier days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes\\nhard to induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the\\nperils of this new and daring warfare; such men protesting that\\nalthough other leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase\\nand point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not\\nfor mortal man. That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn\\ninto a quick eternity. On this head, there are some remarkable\\ndocuments that may be consulted.\\nNevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these\\nthings were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater\\nnumber who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely,\\nwithout the specific details of any certain calamity, and without\\nsuperstitious accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee\\nfrom the battle if offered.\\nOne of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be\\nlinked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously\\ninclined, was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous;\\nthat he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one\\nand the same instant of time.\\nNor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\\naltogether without some faint show of superstitious probability. For\\nas the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been\\ndivulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of\\nthe Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part,\\nunaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have\\noriginated the most curious and contradictory speculations\\nregarding them, especially concerning the mystic modes whereby,\\nafter sounding to a great depth, he transports himself with such\\nvast swiftness to the most widely distant points.\\nIt is a thing well known to both American and English whale-\\nships, and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years\\nago by Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in\\nthe Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons\\ndarted in the Greenland seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some\\nof these instances it has been declared that the interval of time\\nbetween the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days.\\nHence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that\\nthe Nor’ West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a\\nproblem to the whale. So that here, in the real living experience of\\nliving men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello\\nmountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in\\nwhich the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still\\nmore wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse\\n(whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by\\nan underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully\\nequalled by the realities of the whalemen.\\nForced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\\nknowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\\nescaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some\\nwhalemen should go still further in their superstitions; declaring\\nMoby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but\\nubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in\\nhis flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he\\nshould ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be\\nbut a ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows\\nhundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be\\nseen.\\nBut even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was\\nenough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the\\nmonster to strike the imagination with unwonted power. For, it was\\nnot so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him\\nfrom other sperm whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out—a\\npeculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical\\nwhite hump. These were his prominent features; the tokens whereby,\\neven in the limitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a\\nlong distance, to those who knew him.\\nThe rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled\\nwith the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his\\ndistinctive appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally\\njustified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through\\na dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all\\nspangled with golden gleamings.\\nNor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor\\nyet his deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with\\nnatural terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which,\\naccording to specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced\\nin his assaults. More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of\\ndismay than perhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his\\nexulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had\\nseveral times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing\\ndown upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them\\nback in consternation to their ship.\\nAlready several fatalities had attended his chase. But though\\nsimilar disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means\\nunusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the\\nWhite Whale’s infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every\\ndismembering or death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as\\nhaving been inflicted by an unintelligent agent.\\nJudge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds\\nof his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips\\nof chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they\\nswam out of the white curds of the whale’s direful wrath into the\\nserene, exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a\\nbridal.\\nHis three boats stove around him, and oars and men both\\nwhirling in the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his\\nbroken prow, had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his\\nfoe, blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep\\nlife of the whale. That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that\\nsuddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby\\nDick had reaped away Ahab’s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in\\nthe field. No turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have\\nsmote him with more seeming malice. Small reason was there to\\ndoubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had\\ncherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell\\nfor that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with\\nhim, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual\\nexasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the\\nmonomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some\\ndeep men feel eating in them, till they are left living on with half a\\nheart and half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been\\nfrom the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians\\nascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east\\nreverenced in their statue devil;—Ahab did not fall down and\\nworship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the\\nabhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All\\nthat most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things;\\nall truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the\\nbrain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy\\nAhab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in\\nMoby Dick. He piled upon the whale’s white hump the sum of all\\nthe general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down;\\nand then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart’s\\nshell upon it.\\nIt is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise\\nat the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at\\nthe monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden,\\npassionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that\\ntore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but\\nnothing more. Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards\\nhome, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish\\nlay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that\\ndreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body\\nand gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made\\nhim mad. That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the\\nencounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but\\ncertain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a\\nraving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength\\nyet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his\\ndelirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as\\nhe sailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the\\nmad rockings of the gales. And, when running into more sufferable\\nlatitudes, the ship, with mild stun’sails spread, floated across the\\ntranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man’s delirium\\nseemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came\\nforth from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then,\\nwhen he bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his\\ncalm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful\\nmadness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved\\non. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.\\nWhen you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into\\nsome still subtler form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but\\ndeepeningly contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble\\nNorthman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland\\ngorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of\\nAhab’s broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad\\nmadness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished. That\\nbefore living agent, now became the living instrument. If such a\\nfurious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general\\nsanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its\\nown mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to\\nthat one end, did now possess a thousand fold more potency than\\never he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable\\nobject.\\nThis is much; yet Ahab’s larger, darker, deeper part remains\\nunhinted. But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is\\nprofound. Winding far down from within the very heart of this\\nspiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand—however grand and\\nwonderful, now quit it;—and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls,\\nto those vast Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the\\nfantastic towers of man’s upper earth, his root of grandeur, his\\nwhole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique buried\\nbeneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken\\nthrone, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he\\npatient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of\\nages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that\\nproud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young\\nexiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old State-\\nsecret come.\\nNow, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my\\nmeans are sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power\\nto kill, or change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind\\nhe did long dissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his\\ndissembling was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will\\ndeterminate. Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that\\ndissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no\\nNantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and\\nthat to the quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken\\nhim.\\nThe report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise\\npopularly ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added\\nmoodiness which always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the\\nPequod on the present voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it\\nso very unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for another\\nwhaling voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating\\npeople of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that\\nfor those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on\\nedge, for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt\\nof whales. Gnawed within and scorched without, with the infixed,\\nunrelenting fangs of some incurable idea; such an one, could he be\\nfound, would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance\\nagainst the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason\\nthought to be corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one\\nwould seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his\\nunderlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is, that\\nwith the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in\\nhim, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the\\none only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had\\nany one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of\\nwhat was lurking in him then, how soon would their aghast and\\nrighteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man!\\nThey were bent on profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down\\nin dollars from the mint. He was intent on an audacious,\\nimmitigable, and supernatural revenge.\\nHere, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with\\ncurses a Job’s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too,\\nchiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and\\ncannibals—morally enfeebled also, by the incompetence of mere\\nunaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the invulnerable\\njollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading\\nmediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially\\npicked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his\\nmonomaniac revenge. How it was that they so aboundingly\\nresponded to the old man’s ire—by what evil magic their souls were\\npossessed, that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White\\nWhale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be\\n—what the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious\\nunderstandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have\\nseemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,—all this to\\nexplain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The\\nsubterranean miner that works in us all, how can one tell whither\\nleads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who\\ndoes not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a\\nseventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the\\nabandonment of the time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to\\nencounter the whale, could see naught in that brute but the\\ndeadliest ill.\\nCHAPTER 42. The Whiteness\\nof the Whale.\\nWhat the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at\\ntimes, he was to me, as yet remains unsaid.\\nAside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby\\nDick, which could not but occasionally awaken in any man’s soul\\nsome alarm, there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless\\nhorror concerning him, which at times by its intensity completely\\noverpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable\\nwas it, that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form.\\nIt was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me.\\nBut how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim,\\nrandom way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be\\nnaught.\\nThough in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances\\nbeauty, as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles,\\njaponicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way\\nrecognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the\\nbarbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the title “Lord of the\\nWhite Elephants” above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of\\ndominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-\\nwhite quadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag\\nbearing the one figure of a snow-white charger; and the great\\nAustrian Empire, Cæsarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the\\nimperial colour the same imperial hue; and though this pre-\\neminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving the white\\nman ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and though, besides,\\nall this, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for\\namong the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and though\\nin other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is made\\nthe emblem of many touching, noble things—the innocence of\\nbrides, the benignity of age; though among the Red Men of\\nAmerica the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest\\npledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness typifies the\\nmajesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the\\ndaily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds; though\\neven in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has\\nbeen made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power; by the\\nPersian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being held the\\nholiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove\\nhimself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to\\nthe noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog\\nwas by far the holiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful\\ncreature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great\\nSpirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and though\\ndirectly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests derive the\\nname of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn\\nbeneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the\\nRomish faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the\\nPassion of our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes\\nare given to the redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand\\nclothed in white before the great white throne, and the Holy One\\nthat sitteth there white like wool; yet for all these accumulated\\nassociations, with whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime,\\nthere yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this\\nhue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which\\naffrights in blood.\\nThis elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness,\\nwhen divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any\\nobject terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest\\nbounds. Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of\\nthe tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the\\ntranscendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which\\nimparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than\\nterrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-\\nfanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the\\nwhite-shrouded bear or shark.*\\n*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by\\nhim who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the\\nwhiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable\\nhideousness \\nof \\nthat \\nbrute; \\nfor, \\nanalysed, \\nthat \\nheightened\\nhideousness, it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that\\nthe irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the\\nfleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing\\ntogether two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear\\nfrightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this\\nto be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have\\nthat intensified terror.\\nAs for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in\\nthat creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies\\nwith the same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is\\nmost vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that\\nfish. The Romish mass for the dead begins with “Requiem eternam”\\n(eternal rest), whence Requiem denominating the mass itself, and\\nany other funeral music. Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness\\nof death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the\\nFrench call him Requin.\\nBethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of\\nspiritual wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom\\nsails in all imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but\\nGod’s great, unflattering laureate, Nature.*\\n*I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a\\nprolonged gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my\\nforenoon watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and\\nthere, dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing\\nof unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At\\nintervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace\\nsome holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it.\\nThough bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king’s ghost in\\nsupernatural distress. Through its inexpressible, strange eyes,\\nmethought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As\\nAbraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so\\nwhite, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had\\nlost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns.\\nLong I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint,\\nthe things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and\\nturning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied.\\nGoney! never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this\\nglorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some\\ntime after, I learned that goney was some seaman’s name for\\nalbatross. So that by no possibility could Coleridge’s wild Rhyme\\nhave had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were\\nmine, when I saw that bird upon our deck. For neither had I then\\nread the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in saying\\nthis, I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of\\nthe poem and the poet.\\nI assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird\\nchiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this,\\nthat by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses;\\nand these I have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as\\nwhen I beheld the Antarctic fowl.\\nBut how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I\\nwill tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the\\nsea. At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered,\\nleathern tally round its neck, with the ship’s time and place; and\\nthen letting it escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for\\nman, was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the\\nwing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!\\nMost famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that\\nof the White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,\\nlarge-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a\\nthousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the\\nelected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those\\ndays were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies.\\nAt their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star\\nwhich every evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing\\ncascade of his mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with\\nhousings more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have\\nfurnished him. A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that\\nunfallen, western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and\\nhunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam\\nwalked majestic as a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty\\nsteed. Whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of\\ncountless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an\\nOhio; or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all\\naround at the horizon, the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them\\nwith warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness; in whatever\\naspect he presented himself, always to the bravest Indians he was\\nthe object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor can it be\\nquestioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble\\nhorse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed\\nhim with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it which,\\nthough commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain\\nnameless terror.\\nBut there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that\\naccessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and\\nAlbatross.\\nWhat is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often\\nshocks the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and\\nkin! It is that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the\\nname he bears. The Albino is as well made as other men—has no\\nsubstantive deformity—and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading\\nwhiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest\\nabortion. Why should this be so?\\nNor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but\\nnot the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this\\ncrowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the\\ngauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the\\nWhite Squall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human\\nmalice omitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the\\neffect of that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy\\nsymbol of their faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder\\ntheir bailiff in the market-place!\\nNor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of\\nall mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It\\ncannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of\\nthe dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering\\nthere; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of\\nconsternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And\\nfrom that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the\\nshroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we\\nfail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all\\nghosts rising in a milk-white fog—Yea, while these terrors seize us,\\nlet us add, that even the king of terrors, when personified by the\\nevangelist, rides on his pallid horse.\\nTherefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or\\ngracious thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its\\nprofoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to\\nthe soul.\\nBut though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man\\nto account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we,\\nthen, by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing\\nof whiteness—though for the time either wholly or in great part\\nstripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught\\nfearful, but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same sorcery,\\nhowever modified;—can we thus hope to light upon some chance\\nclue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek?\\nLet us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,\\nand without imagination no man can follow another into these halls.\\nAnd though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions\\nabout to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few\\nperhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore\\nmay not be able to recall them now.\\nWhy to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but\\nloosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the\\nbare mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary,\\nspeechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and\\nhooded with new-fallen snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated\\nProtestant of the Middle American States, why does the passing\\nmention of a White Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless\\nstatue in the soul?\\nOr what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors\\nand kings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the\\nWhite Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the\\nimagination of an untravelled American, than those other storied\\nstructures, its neighbors—the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody?\\nAnd those sublimer towers, the White Mountains of New\\nHampshire, whence, in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic\\nghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name, while\\nthe thought of Virginia’s Blue Ridge is full of a soft, dewy, distant\\ndreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes,\\ndoes the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the\\nfancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of\\nlong lacquered mild afternoons on the waves, followed by the\\ngaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a wholly\\nunsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in\\nreading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does “the tall pale\\nman” of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly\\nglides through the green of the groves—why is this phantom more\\nterrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?\\nNor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling\\nearthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the\\ntearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide\\nfield of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all\\nadroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban\\navenues of house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack\\nof cards;—it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the\\nstrangest, saddest city thou can’st see. For Lima has taken the white\\nveil; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old\\nas Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not\\nthe cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken\\nramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own\\ndistortions.\\nI know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of\\nwhiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating\\nthe terror of objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative\\nmind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness\\nto another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon,\\nespecially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to\\nmuteness or universality. What I mean by these two statements may\\nperhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples.\\nFirst: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands,\\nif by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels\\njust enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under\\nprecisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock\\nto view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness—\\nas if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were\\nswimming round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the\\nshrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a\\nreal ghost; in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings;\\nheart and helm they both go down; he never rests till blue water is\\nunder him again. Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee, “Sir, it\\nwas not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear of\\nthat hideous whiteness that so stirred me?”\\nSecond: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the\\nsnow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in\\nthe mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at\\nsuch vast altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it\\nwould be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same\\nis it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative\\nindifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow,\\nno shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness.\\nNot so the sailor, beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where\\nat times, by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of\\nfrost and air, he, shivering and half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows\\nspeaking hope and solace to his misery, views what seems a\\nboundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice\\nmonuments and splintered crosses.\\nBut thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about\\nwhiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou\\nsurrenderest to a hypo, Ishmael.\\nTell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley\\nof Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey—why is it that\\nupon the sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind\\nhim, so that he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal\\nmuskiness—why will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the\\nground in phrensies of affright? There is no remembrance in him of\\nany gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home, so that\\nthe strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything\\nassociated with the experience of former perils; for what knows he,\\nthis New England colt, of the black bisons of distant Oregon?\\nNo: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of\\nthe knowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of\\nmiles from Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the\\nrending, goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild\\nfoal of the prairies, which this instant they may be trampling into\\ndust.\\nThus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings\\nof the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the\\nwindrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the\\nshaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!\\nThough neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the\\nmystic sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt,\\nsomewhere those things must exist. Though in many of its aspects\\nthis visible world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were\\nformed in fright.\\nBut not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and\\nlearned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more\\nstrange and far more portentous—why, as we have seen, it is at\\nonce the most meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil\\nof the Christian’s Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying\\nagent in things the most appalling to mankind.\\nIs it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids\\nand immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with\\nthe thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the\\nmilky way? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a\\ncolour as the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the\\nconcrete of all colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a\\ndumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows—a\\ncolourless, all-colour of atheism from which we shrink? And when\\nwe consider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all\\nother earthly hues—every stately or lovely emblazoning—the sweet\\ntinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of\\nbutterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls; all these are but\\nsubtile deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only laid on\\nfrom without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the\\nharlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house\\nwithin; and when we proceed further, and consider that the mystical\\ncosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great principle\\nof light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if operating\\nwithout medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips\\nand roses, with its own blank tinge—pondering all this, the palsied\\nuniverse lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in Lapland,\\nwho refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes,\\nso the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental\\nwhite shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And of all\\nthese things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at\\nthe fiery hunt?\\nCHAPTER 43. Hark!\\n“HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”\\nIt was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were\\nstanding in a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in\\nthe waist, to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they\\npassed the buckets to fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most\\npart, on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were\\ncareful not to speak or rustle their feet. From hand to hand, the\\nbuckets went in the deepest silence, only broken by the occasional\\nflap of a sail, and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.\\nIt was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon,\\nwhose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a\\nCholo, the words above.\\n“Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”\\n“Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d’ye mean?”\\n“There it is again—under the hatches—don’t you hear it—a cough\\n—it sounded like a cough.”\\n“Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.”\\n“There again—there it is!—it sounds like two or three sleepers\\nturning over, now!”\\n“Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It’s the three soaked\\nbiscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye—nothing else.\\nLook to the bucket!”\\n“Say what ye will, shipmate; I’ve sharp ears.”\\n“Aye, you are the chap, ain’t ye, that heard the hum of the old\\nQuakeress’s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket;\\nyou’re the chap.”\\n“Grin away; we’ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is\\nsomebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on\\ndeck; and I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too. I\\nheard Stubb tell Flask, one morning watch, that there was\\nsomething of that sort in the wind.”\\n“Tish! the bucket!”\\nCHAPTER 44. The Chart.\\nHad you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the\\nsquall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification\\nof his purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a\\nlocker in the transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of\\nyellowish sea charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down\\ntable. Then seating himself before it, you would have seen him\\nintently study the various lines and shadings which there met his\\neye; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over\\nspaces that before were blank. At intervals, he would refer to piles\\nof old log-books beside him, wherein were set down the seasons\\nand places in which, on various former voyages of various ships,\\nsperm whales had been captured or seen.\\nWhile thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains\\nover his head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and\\nfor ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his\\nwrinkled brow, till it almost seemed that while he himself was\\nmarking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible\\npencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked\\nchart of his forehead.\\nBut it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his\\ncabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they\\nwere brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were\\neffaced, and others were substituted. For with the charts of all four\\noceans before him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and\\neddies, with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that\\nmonomaniac thought of his soul.\\nNow, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the\\nleviathans, it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out\\none solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not\\nso did it seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents;\\nand thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale’s food; and,\\nalso, calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting\\nhim in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises,\\nalmost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to\\nbe upon this or that ground in search of his prey.\\nSo assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of\\nthe sperm whale’s resorting to given waters, that many hunters\\nbelieve that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout\\nthe world; were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet\\ncarefully collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be\\nfound to correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or\\nthe flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to\\nconstruct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*\\n     *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne\\n     out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of\\n     the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By\\n     that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in\\n     course of completion; and portions of it are presented in\\n     the circular. “This chart divides the ocean into districts\\n     of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude;\\n     perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve\\n     columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each\\n     of which districts are three lines; one to show the number\\n     of days that have been spent in each month in every\\n     district, and the two others to show the number of days in\\n     which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.”\\n \\nBesides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to\\nanother, the sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct—say,\\nrather, secret intelligence from the Deity—mostly swim in veins, as\\nthey are called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with\\nsuch undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by\\nany chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in\\nthese cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a\\nsurveyor’s parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly\\nconfined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary vein\\nin which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces some\\nfew miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand\\nor contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-\\nship’s mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic\\nzone. The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and\\nalong that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be\\nlooked for.\\nAnd hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known\\nseparate feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey;\\nbut in crossing the widest expanses of water between those\\ngrounds he could, by his art, so place and time himself on his way,\\nas even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting.\\nThere was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle\\nhis delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,\\nperhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular\\nseasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude\\nthat the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude\\nthis year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that\\nwere found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar\\nand unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved\\ntrue. In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,\\napplies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged\\nsperm whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been\\nseen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the\\nIndian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not\\nfollow, that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any\\nsubsequent corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter\\nhim there. So, too, with some other feeding grounds, where he had\\nat times revealed himself. But all these seemed only his casual\\nstopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of\\nprolonged abode. And where Ahab’s chances of accomplishing his\\nobject have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made\\nto whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a\\nparticular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities\\nwould become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every\\npossibility the next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and\\nplace were conjoined in the one technical phrase—the Season-on-\\nthe-Line. For there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby\\nDick had been periodically descried, lingering in those waters for\\nawhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval\\nin any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the\\ndeadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the\\nwaves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot\\nwhere the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his\\nvengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering\\nvigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this\\nunfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes\\nupon the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it\\nmight be to those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could\\nhe so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening\\nquest.\\nNow, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very\\nbeginning of the Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then\\ncould enable her commander to make the great passage\\nsouthwards, double Cape Horn, and then running down sixty\\ndegrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise\\nthere. Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the\\npremature hour of the Pequod’s sailing had, perhaps, been correctly\\nselected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of things.\\nBecause, an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights\\nwas before him; an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring\\nashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance the\\nWhite Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his\\nperiodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the\\nPersian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other\\nwaters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor’-\\nWesters, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon,\\nmight blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the\\nPequod’s circumnavigating wake.\\nBut granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it\\nnot but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one\\nsolitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of\\nindividual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded\\nMufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the\\npeculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump,\\ncould not but be unmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale,\\nAhab would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till\\nlong after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries—tallied\\nhim, and shall he escape? His broad fins are bored, and scalloped\\nout like a lost sheep’s ear! And here, his mad mind would run on in\\na breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came\\nover him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover\\nhis strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man\\nendure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He\\nsleeps with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in\\nhis palms.\\nOften, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and\\nintolerably vivid dreams of the night, which, resuming his own\\nintense thoughts through the day, carried them on amid a clashing\\nof phrensies, and whirled them round and round and round in his\\nblazing brain, till the very throbbing of his life-spot became\\ninsufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes the case, these\\nspiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base, and a\\nchasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and\\nlightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down\\namong them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild\\ncry would be heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab\\nwould burst from his state room, as though escaping from a bed\\nthat was on fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the\\nunsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright at his\\nown resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at\\nsuch times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast\\nhunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock,\\nwas not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror\\nagain. The latter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him; and\\nin sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing\\nmind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or\\nagent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity\\nof the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an\\nintegral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the\\nsoul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s case, yielding up all\\nhis thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose,\\nby its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and\\ndevils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own.\\nNay, could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which\\nit was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and\\nunfathered birth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of\\nbodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for\\nthe time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray\\nof living light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and\\ntherefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts\\nhave created a creature in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus\\nmakes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever;\\nthat vulture the very creature he creates.\\nCHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.\\nSo far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and,\\nindeed, as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and\\ncurious particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing\\nchapter, in its earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in\\nthis volume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further\\nand more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately\\nunderstood, and moreover to take away any incredulity which a\\nprofound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some\\nminds, as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair.\\nI care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall\\nbe content to produce the desired impression by separate citations\\nof items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and\\nfrom these citations, I take it—the conclusion aimed at will naturally\\nfollow of itself.\\nFirst: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after\\nreceiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an\\ninterval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by\\nthe same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the\\nsame private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance\\nwhere three years intervened between the flinging of the two\\nharpoons; and I think it may have been something more than that;\\nthe man who darted them happening, in the interval, to go in a\\ntrading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore there, joined a\\ndiscovery party, and penetrated far into the interior, where he\\ntravelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by\\nserpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other\\ncommon perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown\\nregions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been\\non its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,\\nbrushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.\\nThis man and this whale again came together, and the one\\nvanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known three instances\\nsimilar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and,\\nupon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective\\nmarks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the\\nthree-year instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times,\\nfirst and last, and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort\\nof huge mole under the whale’s eye, which I had observed there\\nthree years previous. I say three years, but I am pretty sure it was\\nmore than that. Here are three instances, then, which I personally\\nknow the truth of; but I have heard of many other instances from\\npersons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to\\nimpeach.\\nSecondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however\\nignorant the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several\\nmemorable historical instances where a particular whale in the\\nocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable.\\nWhy such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and\\noriginally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from\\nother whales; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale\\nmay be, they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and\\nboiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil. No: the reason was\\nthis: that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a\\nterrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did\\nabout Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen were content\\nto recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would\\nbe discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to\\ncultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils\\nashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they make\\ndistant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they\\npursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary\\nthump for their presumption.\\nBut not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great\\nindividual celebrity—Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not\\nonly was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories\\nafter death, but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and\\ndistinctions of a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or\\nCæsar. Was it not so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred\\nlike an iceberg, who so long did’st lurk in the Oriental straits of that\\nname, whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay?\\nWas it not so, O New Zealand Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that\\ncrossed their wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so,\\nO Morquan! King of Japan, whose lofty jet they say at times\\nassumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky? Was\\nit not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old\\ntortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain prose,\\nhere are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean\\nHistory as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar.\\nBut this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at\\nvarious times creating great havoc among the boats of different\\nvessels, were finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out,\\nchased and killed by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their\\nanchors with that express object as much in view, as in setting out\\nthrough the Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his\\nmind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the\\nheadmost warrior of the Indian King Philip.\\nI do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to\\nmake mention of one or two other things, which to me seem\\nimportant, as in printed form establishing in all respects the\\nreasonableness of the whole story of the White Whale, more\\nespecially the catastrophe. For this is one of those disheartening\\ninstances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error. So\\nignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most\\npalpable wonders of the world, that without some hints touching\\nthe plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the fishery, they might\\nscout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still worse and more\\ndetestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.\\nFirst: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the\\ngeneral perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a\\nfixed, vivid conception of those perils, and the frequency with which\\nthey recur. One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual\\ndisasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public\\nrecord at home, however transient and immediately forgotten that\\nrecord. Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this\\nmoment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of New\\nGuinea, is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the\\nsounding leviathan—do you suppose that that poor fellow’s name\\nwill appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at\\nyour breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular between\\nhere and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be\\ncalled regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell\\nyou that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific,\\namong many others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of\\nwhich had had a death by a whale, some of them more than one,\\nand three that had each lost a boat’s crew. For God’s sake, be\\neconomical with your lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but\\nat least one drop of man’s blood was spilled for it.\\nSecondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a\\nwhale is an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever\\nfound that when narrating to them some specific example of this\\ntwo-fold enormousness, they have significantly complimented me\\nupon my facetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no\\nmore idea of being facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history\\nof the plagues of Egypt.\\nBut fortunately the special point I here seek can be established\\nupon testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this:\\nThe Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing,\\nand judiciously malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in,\\nutterly destroy, and sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm\\nWhale has done it.\\nFirst: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of\\nNantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw\\nspouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm\\nwhales. Ere long, several of the whales were wounded; when,\\nsuddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats, issued from\\nthe shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship. Dashing his\\nforehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than “ten\\nminutes” she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of\\nher has been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of the\\ncrew reached the land in their boats. Being returned home at last,\\nCaptain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of\\nanother ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown\\nrocks and breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly lost,\\nand forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since. At\\nthis day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen\\nOwen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the\\ntragedy; I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed\\nwith his son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the\\ncatastrophe.*\\n*The following are extracts from Chace’s narrative: “Every fact\\nseemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but\\nchance which directed his operations; he made two several attacks\\nupon the ship, at a short interval between them, both of which,\\naccording to their direction, were calculated to do us the most\\ninjury, by being made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of\\nthe two objects for the shock; to effect which, the exact manœuvres\\nwhich he made were necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and\\nsuch as indicated resentment and fury. He came directly from the\\nshoal which we had just before entered, and in which we had struck\\nthree of his companions, as if fired with revenge for their sufferings.”\\nAgain: “At all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all\\nhappening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time,\\nimpressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part\\nof the whale (many of which impressions I cannot now recall),\\ninduce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion.”\\nHere are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a\\nblack night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching\\nany hospitable shore. “The dark ocean and swelling waters were\\nnothing; the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest,\\nor dashed upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of\\nfearful contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment’s\\nthought; the dismal looking wreck, and the horrid aspect and\\nrevenge of the whale, wholly engrossed my reflections, until day\\nagain made its appearance.”\\nIn another place—p. 45,—he speaks of “the mysterious and\\nmortal attack of the animal.”\\nSecondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807\\ntotally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic\\nparticulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,\\nthough from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual\\nallusions to it.\\nThirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J——,\\nthen commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class,\\nhappened to be dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a\\nNantucket ship in the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands.\\nConversation turning upon whales, the Commodore was pleased to\\nbe sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the\\nprofessional gentlemen present. He peremptorily denied for\\nexample, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war as to\\ncause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there is\\nmore coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this\\nimpregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by\\na portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments’ confidential\\nbusiness with him. That business consisted in fetching the\\nCommodore’s craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he\\nmade straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair. I am\\nnot superstitious, but I consider the Commodore’s interview with\\nthat whale as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from\\nunbelief by a similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale will stand no\\nnonsense.\\nI will now refer you to Langsdorff’s Voyages for a little\\ncircumstance in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof.\\nLangsdorff, you must know by the way, was attached to the Russian\\nAdmiral Krusenstern’s famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning\\nof the present century. Captain Langsdorff thus begins his\\nseventeenth chapter:\\n“By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next\\nday we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The\\nweather was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we\\nwere obliged to keep on our fur clothing. For some days we had\\nvery little wind; it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from\\nthe northwest sprang up. An uncommon large whale, the body of\\nwhich was larger than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the\\nwater, but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment\\nwhen the ship, which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that\\nit was impossible to prevent its striking against him. We were thus\\nplaced in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature,\\nsetting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the\\nwater. The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who\\nwere below all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we\\nhad struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster\\nsailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain D’Wolf\\napplied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the\\nvessel had received any damage from the shock, but we found that\\nvery happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.”\\nNow, the Captain D’Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship\\nin question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\\nadventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\\nDorchester near Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his.\\nI have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in\\nLangsdorff. He substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by\\nno means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast,\\nand purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which\\nhe sailed from home.\\nIn that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so\\nfull, too, of honest wonders—the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of\\nancient Dampier’s old chums—I found a little matter set down so\\nlike that just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting\\nit here for a corroborative example, if such be needed.\\nLionel, it seems, was on his way to “John Ferdinando,” as he calls\\nthe modern Juan Fernandes. “In our way thither,” he says, “about\\nfour o’clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and\\nfifty leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock,\\nwhich put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell\\nwhere they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare\\nfor death. And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that\\nwe took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when\\nthe amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but\\nfound no ground. * * * * * The suddenness of the shock made the\\nguns leap in their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out\\nof their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun,\\nwas thrown out of his cabin!” Lionel then goes on to impute the\\nshock to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation\\nby stating that a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did\\nactually do great mischief along the Spanish land. But I should not\\nmuch wonder if, in the darkness of that early hour of the morning,\\nthe shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically\\nbumping the hull from beneath.\\nI might proceed with several more examples, one way or another\\nknown to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm\\nwhale. In more than one instance, he has been known, not only to\\nchase the assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship\\nitself, and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.\\nThe English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for\\nhis strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the\\nlines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been\\ntransferred to the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her\\ngreat hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart. Again,\\nit is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once struck, is\\nallowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with blind rage, as\\nwith wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers; nor is it\\nwithout conveying some eloquent indication of his character, that\\nupon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and retain it\\nin that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I must\\nbe content with only one more and a concluding illustration; a\\nremarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to\\nsee, that not only is the most marvellous event in this book\\ncorroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that these\\nmarvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so that\\nfor the millionth time we say amen with Solomon—Verily there is\\nnothing new under the sun.\\nIn the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian\\nmagistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was\\nEmperor and Belisarius general. As many know, he wrote the history\\nof his own times, a work every way of uncommon value. By the best\\nauthorities, he has always been considered a most trustworthy and\\nunexaggerating historian, except in some one or two particulars, not\\nat all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.\\nNow, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the\\nterm of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was\\ncaptured in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after\\nhaving destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of\\nmore than fifty years. A fact thus set down in substantial history\\ncannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of\\nwhat precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as\\nhe destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been\\na whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale. And I\\nwill tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had\\nbeen always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters\\nconnecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not,\\nand perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a\\nplace for his habitual gregarious resort. But further investigations\\nhave recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been\\nisolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the\\nMediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary\\ncoast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of\\na sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the\\nDardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass\\nout of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\\nIn the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar\\nsubstance called brit is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.\\nBut I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale\\n—squid or cuttle-fish—lurks at the bottom of that sea, because\\nlarge creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been\\nfound at its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements\\ntogether, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,\\naccording to all human reasoning, Procopius’s sea-monster, that for\\nhalf a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all\\nprobability have been a sperm whale.\\nCHAPTER 46. Surmises.\\nThough, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his\\nthoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby\\nDick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to\\nthat one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by\\nnature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman’s\\nways, altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the\\nvoyage. Or at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting\\nother motives much more influential with him. It would be refining\\ntoo much, perhaps, even considering his monomania, to hint that\\nhis vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly\\nextended itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that the\\nmore monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the\\nchances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to\\nbe the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed\\nexceptionable, there were still additional considerations which,\\nthough not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling\\npassion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.\\nTo accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools\\nused in the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of\\norder. He knew, for example, that however magnetic his ascendency\\nin some respects was over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not\\ncover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal\\nsuperiority involves intellectual mastership; for to the purely\\nspiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation.\\nStarbuck’s body and Starbuck’s coerced will were Ahab’s, so long as\\nAhab kept his magnet at Starbuck’s brain; still he knew that for all\\nthis the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain’s quest, and\\ncould he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even\\nfrustrate it. It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the\\nWhite Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck would\\never be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his\\ncaptain’s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial\\ninfluences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the\\nsubtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more\\nsignificantly manifested than in his superlative sense and\\nshrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in\\nsome way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness\\nwhich naturally invested it; that the full terror of the voyage must be\\nkept withdrawn into the obscure background (for few men’s courage\\nis proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action); that\\nwhen they stood their long night watches, his officers and men\\nmust have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick. For\\nhowever eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the\\nannouncement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or\\nless capricious and unreliable—they live in the varying outer\\nweather, and they inhale its fickleness—and when retained for any\\nobject remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life\\nand passion in the end, it is above all things requisite that\\ntemporary interests and employments should intervene and hold\\nthem healthily suspended for the final dash.\\nNor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong\\nemotion mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are\\nevanescent. \\nThe \\npermanent \\nconstitutional \\ncondition \\nof \\nthe\\nmanufactured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the\\nWhite Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and\\nplaying round their savageness even breeds a certain generous\\nknight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give\\nchase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for their more\\ncommon, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and chivalric\\nCrusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand\\nmiles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing\\nburglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by\\nthe way. Had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic\\nobject—that final and romantic object, too many would have turned\\nfrom in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all\\nhopes of cash—aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some\\nmonths go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then\\nthis same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same\\ncash would soon cashier Ahab.\\nNor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more\\nrelated to Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and\\nperhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private\\npurpose of the Pequod’s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious\\nthat, in so doing, he had indirectly laid himself open to the\\nunanswerable charge of usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both\\nmoral and legal, his crew if so disposed, and to that end competent,\\ncould refuse all further obedience to him, and even violently wrest\\nfrom him the command. From even the barely hinted imputation of\\nusurpation, and the possible consequences of such a suppressed\\nimpression gaining ground, Ahab must of course have been most\\nanxious to protect himself. That protection could only consist in his\\nown predominating brain and heart and hand, backed by a heedful,\\nclosely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence\\nwhich it was possible for his crew to be subjected to.\\nFor all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be\\nverbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a\\ngood degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the\\nPequod’s voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that,\\nbut force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in\\nthe general pursuit of his profession.\\nBe all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the\\nthree mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out,\\nand not omit reporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long\\nwithout reward.\\nCHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.\\nIt was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging\\nabout the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured\\nwaters. Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is\\ncalled a sword-mat, for an additional lashing to our boat. So still\\nand subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene, and\\nsuch an incantation of reverie lurked in the air, that each silent sailor\\nseemed resolved into his own invisible self.\\nI was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat.\\nAs I kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline\\nbetween the long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the\\nshuttle, and as Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his\\nheavy oaken sword between the threads, and idly looking off upon\\nthe water, carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say\\nso strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and\\nall over the sea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the\\nsword, that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself\\nwere a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates.\\nThere lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single,\\never returning, unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely\\nenough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads\\nwith its own. This warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with\\nmy own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into\\nthese \\nunalterable \\nthreads. \\nMeantime, \\nQueequeg’s \\nimpulsive,\\nindifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof slantingly, or\\ncrookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be; and by this\\ndifference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding\\ncontrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage’s\\nsword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp\\nand woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance—aye, chance,\\nfree will, and necessity—nowise incompatible—all interweavingly\\nworking together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved\\nfrom its ultimate course—its every alternating vibration, indeed, only\\ntending to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given\\nthreads; and chance, though restrained in its play within the right\\nlines of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will,\\nthough thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and\\nhas the last featuring blow at events.\\nThus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a\\nsound so strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly,\\nthat the ball of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing\\nup at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft\\nin the cross-trees was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was\\nreaching eagerly forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at\\nbrief sudden intervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same\\nsound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas,\\nfrom hundreds of whalemen’s look-outs perched as high in the air;\\nbut from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have\\nderived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian’s.\\nAs he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly\\nand eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought\\nhim some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by\\nthose wild cries announcing their coming.\\n“There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!”\\n“Where-away?”\\n“On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!”\\nInstantly all was commotion.\\nThe Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same\\nundeviating and reliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen\\ndistinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus.\\n“There go flukes!” was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales\\ndisappeared.\\n“Quick, steward!” cried Ahab. “Time! time!”\\nDough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the\\nexact minute to Ahab.\\nThe ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently\\nrolling before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down\\nheading to leeward, we confidently looked to see them again\\ndirectly in advance of our bows. For that singular craft at times\\nevinced by the Sperm Whale when, sounding with his head in one\\ndirection, he nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface,\\nmills round, and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter—this\\ndeceitfulness of his could not now be in action; for there was no\\nreason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any\\nway alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinity. One of the men\\nselected for shipkeepers—that is, those not appointed to the boats,\\nby this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The sailors\\nat the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in\\ntheir places; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed,\\nand the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets\\nover high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one\\nhand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the\\ngunwale. So look the long line of man-of-war’s men about to throw\\nthemselves on board an enemy’s ship.\\nBut at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that\\ntook every eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab,\\nwho was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh\\nformed out of air.\\nCHAPTER 48. The First\\nLowering.\\nThe phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other\\nside of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose\\nthe tackles and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had\\nalways been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically\\ncalled the captain’s, on account of its hanging from the starboard\\nquarter. The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart,\\nwith one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A\\nrumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with\\nwide black trowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning\\nthis ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair\\nbraided and coiled round and round upon his head. Less swart in\\naspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow\\ncomplexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the\\nManillas;—a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and\\nby some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and\\nsecret confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord,\\nwhose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.\\nWhile yet the wondering ship’s company were gazing upon these\\nstrangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their\\nhead, “All ready there, Fedallah?”\\n“Ready,” was the half-hissed reply.\\n“Lower away then; d’ye hear?” shouting across the deck. “Lower\\naway there, I say.”\\nSuch was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement\\nthe men sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the\\nblocks; with a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while,\\nwith a dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation,\\nthe sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship’s side into the\\ntossed boats below.\\nHardly had they pulled out from under the ship’s lee, when a\\nfourth keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the\\nstern, and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing\\nerect in the stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread\\nthemselves widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water. But with\\nall their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew,\\nthe inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command.\\n“Captain Ahab?—” said Starbuck.\\n“Spread yourselves,” cried Ahab; “give way, all four boats. Thou,\\nFlask, pull out more to leeward!”\\n“Aye, aye, sir,” cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his\\ngreat steering oar. “Lay back!” addressing his crew. “There!—there!—\\nthere again! There she blows right ahead, boys!—lay back!”\\n“Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.”\\n“Oh, I don’t mind ’em, sir,” said Archy; “I knew it all before now.\\nDidn’t I hear ’em in the hold? And didn’t I tell Cabaco here of it?\\nWhat say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.”\\n“Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little\\nones,” drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of\\nwhom still showed signs of uneasiness. “Why don’t you break your\\nbackbones, my boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder\\nboat? Tut! They are only five more hands come to help us—never\\nmind from where—the more the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never\\nmind the brimstone—devils are good fellows enough. So, so; there\\nyou are now; that’s the stroke for a thousand pounds; that’s the\\nstroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil,\\nmy heroes! Three cheers, men—all hearts alive! Easy, easy; don’t be\\nin a hurry—don’t be in a hurry. Why don’t you snap your oars, you\\nrascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so, then:—softly, softly!\\nThat’s it—that’s it! long and strong. Give way there, give way! The\\ndevil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop\\nsnoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull, can’t ye? pull, won’t\\nye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes don’t ye pull?\\n—pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out! Here!”\\nwhipping out the sharp knife from his girdle; “every mother’s son of\\nye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between his teeth. That’s\\nit—that’s it. Now ye do something; that looks like it, my steel-bits.\\nStart her—start her, my silver-spoons! Start her, marling-spikes!”\\nStubb’s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he\\nhad rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and\\nespecially in inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not\\nsuppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew\\ninto downright passions with his congregation. Not at all; and\\ntherein consisted his chief peculiarity. He would say the most terrific\\nthings to his crew, in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and\\nfury, and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun,\\nthat no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling\\nfor dear life, and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing. Besides\\nhe all the time looked so easy and indolent himself, so loungingly\\nmanaged his steering-oar, and so broadly gaped—open-mouthed at\\ntimes—that the mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer\\nforce of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew. Then again,\\nStubb was one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is\\nsometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their\\nguard in the matter of obeying them.\\nIn obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling\\nobliquely across Stubb’s bow; and when for a minute or so the two\\nboats were pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.\\n“Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye\\nplease!”\\n“Halloa!” returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he\\nspoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set\\nlike a flint from Stubb’s.\\n“What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!”\\n“Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong,\\nstrong, boys!)” in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud\\nagain: “A sad business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!)\\nbut never mind, Mr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull\\nstrong, come what will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There’s hogsheads\\nof sperm ahead, Mr. Stubb, and that’s what ye came for. (Pull, my\\nboys!) Sperm, sperm’s the play! This at least is duty; duty and profit\\nhand in hand.”\\n“Aye, aye, I thought as much,” soliloquized Stubb, when the boats\\ndiverged, “as soon as I clapt eye on ’em, I thought so. Aye, and\\nthat’s what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy\\nlong suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale’s at\\nthe bottom of it. Well, well, so be it! Can’t be helped! All right! Give\\nway, men! It ain’t the White Whale to-day! Give way!”\\nNow the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical\\ninstant as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not\\nunreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some\\nof the ship’s company; but Archy’s fancied discovery having some\\ntime previous got abroad among them, though indeed not credited\\nthen, this had in some small measure prepared them for the event.\\nIt took off the extreme edge of their wonder; and so what with all\\nthis and Stubb’s confident way of accounting for their appearance,\\nthey were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings; though\\nthe affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures\\nas to dark Ahab’s precise agency in the matter from the beginning.\\nFor me, I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen\\ncreeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as\\nwell as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.\\nMeantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the\\nfurthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a\\ncircumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those\\ntiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like\\nfive trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength,\\nwhich periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal\\nburst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was\\nseen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black\\njacket, and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his\\nbody above the gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating\\ndepressions of the watery horizon; while at the other end of the\\nboat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer’s, thrown half backward into\\nthe air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was seen\\nsteadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings\\nere the White Whale had torn him. All at once the outstretched arm\\ngave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed, while the boat’s\\nfive oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat and crew sat\\nmotionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in the rear\\npaused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily down\\ninto the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the\\nmovement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.\\n“Every man look out along his oars!” cried Starbuck. “Thou,\\nQueequeg, stand up!”\\nNimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the\\nsavage stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off\\ntowards the spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise\\nupon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly\\nplatformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly\\nand adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of\\na craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.\\nNot very far distant Flask’s boat was also lying breathlessly still; its\\ncommander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a\\nstout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet\\nabove the level of the stern platform. It is used for catching turns\\nwith the whale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a\\nman’s hand, and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed\\nperched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but\\nher trucks. But little King-Post was small and short, and at the same\\ntime little King-Post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this\\nloggerhead stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.\\n“I can’t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on\\nto that.”\\nUpon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady\\nhis way, swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his\\nlofty shoulders for a pedestal.\\n“Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?”\\n“That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish\\nyou fifty feet taller.”\\nWhereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of\\nthe boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat\\npalm to Flask’s foot, and then putting Flask’s hand on his hearse-\\nplumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss,\\nwith one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his\\nshoulders. And here was Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted\\narm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady\\nhimself by.\\nAt any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what\\nwondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain\\nan erect posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most\\nriotously perverse and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see\\nhim giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such\\ncircumstances. But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic\\nDaggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself with a cool,\\nindifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to\\nevery roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad\\nback, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked\\nnobler than the rider. Though truly vivacious, tumultuous,\\nostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience;\\nbut not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro’s lordly\\nchest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living\\nmagnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her\\nseasons for that.\\nMeanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing\\nsolicitudes. The whales might have made one of their regular\\nsoundings, not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were\\nthe case, Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to\\nsolace the languishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his\\nhatband, where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it,\\nand rammed home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had\\nhe ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when\\nTashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward\\nlike two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect\\nattitude to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, “Down,\\ndown all, and give way!—there they are!”\\nTo a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have\\nbeen visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish\\nwhite water, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and\\nsuffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from\\nwhite rolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled,\\nas it were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath\\nthis atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin\\nlayer of water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of\\nall the other indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed\\ntheir forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders.\\nAll four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of\\ntroubled water and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on\\nand on, as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid\\nstream from the hills.\\n“Pull, pull, my good boys,” said Starbuck, in the lowest possible\\nbut intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed\\nglance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost\\nseemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses.\\nHe did not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say\\nanything to him. Only the silence of the boat was at intervals\\nstartlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with\\ncommand, now soft with entreaty.\\nHow different the loud little King-Post. “Sing out and say\\nsomething, my hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me,\\nbeach me on their black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I’ll\\nsign over to you my Martha’s Vineyard plantation, boys; including\\nwife and children, boys. Lay me on—lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I\\nshall go stark, staring mad! See! see that white water!” And so\\nshouting, he pulled his hat from his head, and stamped up and\\ndown on it; then picking it up, flirted it far off upon the sea; and\\nfinally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat’s stern like a crazed\\ncolt from the prairie.\\n“Look at that chap now,” philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with\\nhis unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at\\na short distance, followed after—“He’s got fits, that Flask has. Fits?\\nyes, give him fits—that’s the very word—pitch fits into ’em. Merrily,\\nmerrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;—merry’s the\\nword. Pull, babes—pull, sucklings—pull, all. But what the devil are\\nyou hurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only pull,\\nand keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite\\nyour knives in two—that’s all. Take it easy—why don’t ye take it\\neasy, I say, and burst all your livers and lungs!”\\nBut what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow\\ncrew of his—these were words best omitted here; for you live under\\nthe blessed light of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in\\nthe audacious seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado\\nbrow, and eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped\\nafter his prey.\\nMeanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions\\nof Flask to “that whale,” as he called the fictitious monster which he\\ndeclared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat’s bow with its tail—\\nthese allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that they\\nwould cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look\\nover the shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen\\nmust put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks;\\nusage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no\\nlimbs but arms, in these critical moments.\\nIt was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the\\nomnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled\\nalong the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless\\nbowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would\\ntip for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that\\nalmost seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound\\ndip into the watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and\\ngoadings to gain the top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like\\nslide down its other side;—all these, with the cries of the headsmen\\nand harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with\\nthe wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her\\nboats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming\\nbrood;—all this was thrilling.\\nNot the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the\\nfever heat of his first battle; not the dead man’s ghost encountering\\nthe first unknown phantom in the other world;—neither of these\\ncan feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who\\nfor the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned\\ncircle of the hunted sperm whale.\\nThe dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming\\nmore and more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun\\ncloud-shadows flung upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer\\nblended, but tilted everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed\\nseparating their wakes. The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck\\ngiving chase to three whales running dead to leeward. Our sail was\\nnow set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along; the boat\\ngoing with such madness through the water, that the lee oars could\\nscarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the\\nrow-locks.\\nSoon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist;\\nneither ship nor boat to be seen.\\n“Give way, men,” whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the\\nsheet of his sail; “there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall\\ncomes. There’s white water again!—close to! Spring!”\\nSoon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us\\ndenoted that the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they\\noverheard, when with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said:\\n“Stand up!” and Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.\\nThough not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and\\ndeath peril so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the\\nintense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew\\nthat the imminent instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous\\nwallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter.\\nMeanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist, the waves\\ncurling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged\\nserpents.\\n“That’s his hump. There, there, give it to him!” whispered Starbuck.\\nA short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted\\niron of Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an\\ninvisible push from astern, while forward the boat seemed striking\\non a ledge; the sail collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding\\nvapor shot up near by; something rolled and tumbled like an\\nearthquake beneath us. The whole crew were half suffocated as they\\nwere tossed helter-skelter into the white curdling cream of the\\nsquall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all blended together; and the\\nwhale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.\\nThough completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed.\\nSwimming round it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing\\nthem across the gunwale, tumbled back to our places. There we sat\\nup to our knees in the sea, the water covering every rib and plank,\\nso that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a\\ncoral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean.\\nThe wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers\\ntogether; the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us\\nlike a white fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were\\nburning; immortal in these jaws of death! In vain we hailed the\\nother boats; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a\\nflaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm. Meanwhile the\\ndriving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night;\\nno sign of the ship could be seen. The rising sea forbade all\\nattempts to bale out the boat. The oars were useless as propellers,\\nperforming now the office of life-preservers. So, cutting the lashing\\nof the waterproof match keg, after many failures Starbuck contrived\\nto ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a waif pole,\\nhanded it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope.\\nThere, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of\\nthat almighty forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign and symbol\\nof a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of\\ndespair.\\nWet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or\\nboat, we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still\\nspread over the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of\\nthe boat. Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand\\nto his ear. We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards\\nhitherto muffled by the storm. The sound came nearer and nearer;\\nthe thick mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted,\\nwe all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view,\\nbearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more\\nthan its length.\\nFloating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one\\ninstant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship’s bows like a chip at\\nthe base of a cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it\\nwas seen no more till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam\\nfor it, were dashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up\\nand safely landed on board. Ere the squall came close to, the other\\nboats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good\\ntime. The ship had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it\\nmight light upon some token of our perishing,—an oar or a lance\\npole.\\nCHAPTER 49. The Hyena.\\nThere are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed\\naffair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast\\npractical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and\\nmore than suspects that the joke is at nobody’s expense but his\\nown. However, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while\\ndisputing. He bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and\\npersuasions, all hard things visible and invisible, never mind how\\nknobby; as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and\\ngun flints. And as for small difficulties and worryings, prospects of\\nsudden disaster, peril of life and limb; all these, and death itself,\\nseem to him only sly, good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the\\nside bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker. That odd\\nsort of wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man only in\\nsome time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of his\\nearnestness, so that what just before might have seemed to him a\\nthing most momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke.\\nThere is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and\\neasy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with it I now\\nregarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White\\nWhale its object.\\n“Queequeg,” said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to\\nthe deck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the\\nwater; “Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often\\nhappen?” Without much emotion, though soaked through just like\\nme, he gave me to understand that such things did often happen.\\n“Mr. Stubb,” said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his\\noil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; “Mr. Stubb, I\\nthink I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our\\nchief mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I\\nsuppose then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set\\nin a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman’s discretion?”\\n“Certain. I’ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off\\nCape Horn.”\\n“Mr. Flask,” said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing\\nclose by; “you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will\\nyou tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask,\\nfor an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost\\ninto death’s jaws?”\\n“Can’t you twist that smaller?” said Flask. “Yes, that’s the law. I\\nshould like to see a boat’s crew backing water up to a whale face\\nforemost. Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind\\nthat!”\\nHere then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate\\nstatement of the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and\\ncapsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep,\\nwere matters of common occurrence in this kind of life; considering\\nthat at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I\\nmust resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat—\\noftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his\\nimpetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own\\nfrantic stampings; considering that the particular disaster to our own\\nparticular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck’s driving on to\\nhis whale almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that\\nStarbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great heedfulness in\\nthe fishery; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly\\nprudent Starbuck’s boat; and finally considering in what a devil’s\\nchase I was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking all things\\ntogether, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make a\\nrough draft of my will. “Queequeg,” said I, “come along, you shall be\\nmy lawyer, executor, and legatee.”\\nIt may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at\\ntheir last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world\\nmore fond of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical\\nlife that I had done the same thing. After the ceremony was\\nconcluded upon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone\\nwas rolled away from my heart. Besides, all the days I should now\\nlive would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his\\nresurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or\\nweeks as the case might be. I survived myself; my death and burial\\nwere locked up in my chest. I looked round me tranquilly and\\ncontentedly, like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside\\nthe bars of a snug family vault.\\nNow then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my\\nfrock, here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction,\\nand the devil fetch the hindmost.\\nCHAPTER 50. Ahab’s Boat and\\nCrew. Fedallah.\\n“Who would have thought it, Flask!” cried Stubb; “if I had but one\\nleg you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the\\nplug-hole with my timber toe. Oh! he’s a wonderful old man!”\\n“I don’t think it so strange, after all, on that account,” said Flask.\\n“If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing.\\nThat would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the\\nother left, you know.”\\n“I don’t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.”\\nAmong whale-wise people it has often been argued whether,\\nconsidering the paramount importance of his life to the success of\\nthe voyage, it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in\\nthe active perils of the chase. So Tamerlane’s soldiers often argued\\nwith tears in their eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to\\nbe carried into the thickest of the fight.\\nBut with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect.\\nConsidering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all\\ntimes of danger; considering that the pursuit of whales is always\\nunder great and extraordinary difficulties; that every individual\\nmoment, indeed, then comprises a peril; under these circumstances\\nis it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As\\na general thing, the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly\\nthought not.\\nAhab well knew that although his friends at home would think\\nlittle of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless\\nvicissitudes of the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of\\naction and giving his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have\\na boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the\\nhunt—above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra\\nmen, as that same boat’s crew, he well knew that such generous\\nconceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod.\\nTherefore he had not solicited a boat’s crew from them, nor had he\\nin any way hinted his desires on that head. Nevertheless he had\\ntaken private measures of his own touching all that matter. Until\\nCabaco’s published discovery, the sailors had little foreseen it,\\nthough to be sure when, after being a little while out of port, all\\nhands had concluded the customary business of fitting the\\nwhaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now\\nand then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-\\npins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the\\nspare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers,\\nwhich when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in\\nthe bow: when all this was observed in him, and particularly his\\nsolicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the\\nboat, as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his\\nivory limb; and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the\\nthigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes called, the horizontal\\npiece in the boat’s bow for bracing the knee against in darting or\\nstabbing at the whale; when it was observed how often he stood up\\nin that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi-circular\\ndepression in the cleat, and with the carpenter’s chisel gouged out\\na little here and straightened it a little there; all these things, I say,\\nhad awakened much interest and curiosity at the time. But almost\\neverybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in\\nAhab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick;\\nfor he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal\\nmonster in person. But such a supposition did by no means involve\\nthe remotest suspicion as to any boat’s crew being assigned to that\\nboat.\\nNow, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained\\nsoon waned away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now\\nand then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations\\ncome up from the unknown nooks and ash-holes of the earth to\\nman these floating outlaws of whalers; and the ships themselves\\noften pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about\\nthe open sea on planks, bits of wreck, oars, whaleboats, canoes,\\nblown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that Beelzebub himself\\nmight climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with\\nthe captain, and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in\\nthe forecastle.\\nBut be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate\\nphantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it\\nwere somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah\\nremained a muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a\\nmannerly world like this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon\\nevinced himself to be linked with Ahab’s peculiar fortunes; nay, so\\nfar as to have some sort of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows,\\nbut it might have been even authority over him; all this none knew.\\nBut one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah. He\\nwas such a creature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate\\nzone only see in their dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of\\nwhom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic\\ncommunities, especially the Oriental isles to the east of the\\ncontinent—those insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries,\\nwhich even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly\\naboriginalness of earth’s primal generations, when the memory of\\nthe first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his\\ndescendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real\\nphantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were\\ncreated and to what end; when though, according to Genesis, the\\nangels indeed consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also,\\nadd the uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.\\nCHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Spout.\\nDays, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had\\nslowly swept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the\\nAzores; off the Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off\\nthe mouth of the Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an\\nunstaked, watery locality, southerly from St. Helena.\\nIt was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene\\nand moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of\\nsilver; and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a\\nsilvery silence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was\\nseen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the\\nmoon, it looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god\\nuprising from the sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these\\nmoonlight nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head,\\nand stand a look-out there, with the same precision as if it had\\nbeen day. And yet, though herds of whales were seen by night, not\\none whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them. You\\nmay think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old\\nOriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the\\nmoon, companions in one sky. But when, after spending his uniform\\ninterval there for several successive nights without uttering a single\\nsound; when, after all this silence, his unearthly voice was heard\\nannouncing that silvery, moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner started\\nto his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and\\nhailed the mortal crew. “There she blows!” Had the trump of\\njudgment blown, they could not have quivered more; yet still they\\nfelt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was a most unwonted\\nhour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously exciting, that\\nalmost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering.\\nWalking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab\\ncommanded the t’gallant sails and royals to be set, and every\\nstunsail spread. The best man in the ship must take the helm. Then,\\nwith every mast-head manned, the piled-up craft rolled down\\nbefore the wind. The strange, upheaving, lifting tendency of the\\ntaffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails, made the\\nbuoyant, hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet; while still\\nshe rushed along, as if two antagonistic influences were struggling\\nin her—one to mount direct to heaven, the other to drive yawingly\\nto some horizontal goal. And had you watched Ahab’s face that\\nnight, you would have thought that in him also two different things\\nwere warring. While his one live leg made lively echoes along the\\ndeck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap. On life\\nand death this old man walked. But though the ship so swiftly sped,\\nand though from every eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet\\nthe silvery jet was no more seen that night. Every sailor swore he\\nsaw it once, but not a second time.\\nThis midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when,\\nsome days after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced:\\nagain it was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it,\\nonce more it disappeared as if it had never been. And so it served\\nus night after night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it.\\nMysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case\\nmight be; disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or\\nthree; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be\\nadvancing still further and further in our van, this solitary jet\\nseemed for ever alluring us on.\\nNor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in\\naccordance with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many\\nthings invested the Pequod, were there wanting some of the\\nseamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried; at\\nhowever remote times, or in however far apart latitudes and\\nlongitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by one self-same whale;\\nand that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there reigned, too, a sense\\nof peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as if it were treacherously\\nbeckoning us on and on, in order that the monster might turn\\nround upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage\\nseas.\\nThese temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a\\nwondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in\\nwhich, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a\\ndevilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through\\nseas so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to\\nour vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-\\nlike prow.\\nBut, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began\\nhowling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled\\nseas that are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to\\nthe blast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like\\nshowers of silver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then\\nall this desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights\\nmore dismal than before.\\nClose to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and\\nthither before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-\\nravens. And every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these\\nbirds were seen; and spite of our hootings, for a long time\\nobstinately clung to the hemp, as though they deemed our ship\\nsome drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing appointed to desolation,\\nand therefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves. And\\nheaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black sea, as if its\\nvast tides were a conscience; and the great mundane soul were in\\nanguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.\\nCape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as\\ncalled of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before\\nhad attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented\\nsea, where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these\\nfish, seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any\\nhaven in store, or beat that black air without any horizon. But calm,\\nsnow-white, and unvarying; still directing its fountain of feathers to\\nthe sky; still beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at\\ntimes be descried.\\nDuring all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming\\nfor the time the almost continual command of the drenched and\\ndangerous deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more\\nseldom than ever addressed his mates. In tempestuous times like\\nthese, after everything above and aloft has been secured, nothing\\nmore can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale. Then\\nCaptain and crew become practical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg\\ninserted into its accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly\\ngrasping a shroud, Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing\\ndead to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would\\nall but congeal his very eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew\\ndriven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that\\nburstingly broke over its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in\\nthe waist; and the better to guard against the leaping waves, each\\nman had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail,\\nin which he swung as in a loosened belt. Few or no words were\\nspoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by painted sailors in wax,\\nday after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of\\nthe demoniac waves. By night the same muteness of humanity\\nbefore the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence the men\\nswung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast.\\nEven when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not\\nseek that repose in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the\\nold man’s aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to\\nmark how the barometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting\\nstraight in his floor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of\\nthe storm from which he had some time before emerged, still slowly\\ndripping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him\\nlay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have\\npreviously been spoken of. His lantern swung from his tightly\\nclenched hand. Though the body was erect, the head was thrown\\nback so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of\\nthe tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling.*\\n*The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going\\nto the compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform\\nhimself of the course of the ship.\\nTerrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in\\nthis gale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.\\nCHAPTER 52. The Albatross.\\nSouth-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good\\ncruising ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the\\nGoney (Albatross) by name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty\\nperch at the fore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so\\nremarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries—a whaler at sea, and\\nlong absent from home.\\nAs if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the\\nskeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral\\nappearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while\\nall her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees\\nfurred over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild\\nsight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-\\nheads. They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and\\nbepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of\\ncruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast, they swayed and\\nswung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship slowly\\nglided close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to\\neach other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads\\nof one ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking\\nfishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to\\nour own look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being heard\\nfrom below.\\n“Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?”\\nBut as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was\\nin the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from\\nhis hand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain\\nstrove to make himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still\\nincreasing the distance between. While in various silent ways the\\nseamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this\\nominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale’s\\nname to another ship, Ahab for a moment paused; it almost\\nseemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the\\nstranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But taking\\nadvantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet,\\nand knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a\\nNantucketer and shortly bound home, he loudly hailed—“Ahoy\\nthere! This is the Pequod, bound round the world! Tell them to\\naddress all future letters to the Pacific ocean! and this time three\\nyears, if I am not at home, tell them to address them to ——”\\nAt that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly,\\nthen, in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small\\nharmless fish, that for some days before had been placidly\\nswimming by our side, darted away with what seemed shuddering\\nfins, and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger’s flanks.\\nThough in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often\\nbefore have noticed a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man,\\nthe veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings.\\n“Swim away from me, do ye?” murmured Ahab, gazing over into\\nthe water. There seemed but little in the words, but the tone\\nconveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man\\nhad ever before evinced. But turning to the steersman, who thus far\\nhad been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway, he\\ncried out in his old lion voice,—“Up helm! Keep her off round the\\nworld!”\\nRound the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud\\nfeelings; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only\\nthrough numberless perils to the very point whence we started,\\nwhere those that we left behind secure, were all the time before us.\\nWere this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we\\ncould for ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet\\nand strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then\\nthere were promise in the voyage. But in pursuit of those far\\nmysteries we dream of, or in tormented chase of that demon\\nphantom that, some time or other, swims before all human hearts;\\nwhile chasing such over this round globe, they either lead us on in\\nbarren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.\\nCHAPTER 53. The Gam.\\nThe ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the\\nwhaler we had spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms.\\nBut even had this not been the case, he would not after all,\\nperhaps, have boarded her—judging by his subsequent conduct on\\nsimilar occasions—if so it had been that, by the process of hailing,\\nhe had obtained a negative answer to the question he put. For, as it\\neventually turned out, he cared not to consort, even for five\\nminutes, with any stranger captain, except he could contribute some\\nof that information he so absorbingly sought. But all this might\\nremain inadequately estimated, were not something said here of the\\npeculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other in\\nforeign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.\\nIf two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or\\nthe equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually\\nencountering each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for\\nthe life of them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping\\nfor a moment to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down\\nfor a while and resting in concert: then, how much more natural\\nthat upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the\\nsea, two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the\\nearth—off lone Fanning’s Island, or the far away King’s Mills; how\\nmuch more natural, I say, that under such circumstances these ships\\nshould not only interchange hails, but come into still closer, more\\nfriendly and sociable contact. And especially would this seem to be\\na matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and\\nwhose captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally\\nknown to each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear\\ndomestic things to talk about.\\nFor the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has\\nletters on board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some\\npapers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred\\nand thumb-worn files. And in return for that courtesy, the outward-\\nbound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the\\ncruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the\\nutmost importance to her. And in degree, all this will hold true\\nconcerning whaling vessels crossing each other’s track on the\\ncruising-ground itself, even though they are equally long absent\\nfrom home. For one of them may have received a transfer of letters\\nfrom some third, and now far remote vessel; and some of those\\nletters may be for the people of the ship she now meets. Besides,\\nthey would exchange the whaling news, and have an agreeable chat.\\nFor not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors, but\\nlikewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common\\npursuit and mutually shared privations and perils.\\nNor would difference of country make any very essential\\ndifference; that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is\\nthe case with Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the\\nsmall number of English whalers, such meetings do not very often\\noccur, and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of\\nshyness between them; for your Englishman is rather reserved, and\\nyour Yankee, he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but\\nhimself. Besides, the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of\\nmetropolitan superiority over the American whalers; regarding the\\nlong, lean Nantucketer, with his nondescript provincialisms, as a sort\\nof sea-peasant. But where this superiority in the English whalemen\\ndoes really consist, it would be hard to say, seeing that the Yankees\\nin one day, collectively, kill more whales than all the English,\\ncollectively, in ten years. But this is a harmless little foible in the\\nEnglish whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much\\nto heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles\\nhimself.\\nSo, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the\\nwhalers have most reason to be sociable—and they are so.\\nWhereas, some merchant ships crossing each other’s wake in the\\nmid-Atlantic, will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single\\nword of recognition, mutually cutting each other on the high seas,\\nlike a brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time indulging,\\nperhaps, in finical criticism upon each other’s rig. As for Men-of-War,\\nwhen they chance to meet at sea, they first go through such a\\nstring of silly bowings and scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that\\nthere does not seem to be much right-down hearty good-will and\\nbrotherly love about it at all. As touching Slave-ships meeting, why,\\nthey are in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each other\\nas soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross\\neach other’s cross-bones, the first hail is—“How many skulls?”—the\\nsame way that whalers hail—“How many barrels?” And that question\\nonce answered, pirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal\\nvillains on both sides, and don’t like to see overmuch of each\\nother’s villanous likenesses.\\nBut look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,\\nfree-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets\\nanother whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a “Gam,” a\\nthing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of\\nthe name even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only\\ngrin at it, and repeat gamesome stuff about “spouters” and\\n“blubber-boilers,” and such like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all\\nMerchant-seamen, and also all Pirates and Man-of-War’s men, and\\nSlave-ship sailors, cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-\\nships; this is a question it would be hard to answer. Because, in the\\ncase of pirates, say, I should like to know whether that profession of\\ntheirs has any peculiar glory about it. It sometimes ends in\\nuncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows. And besides,\\nwhen a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper\\nfoundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I conclude, that in\\nboasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman, in that\\nassertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.\\nBut what is a Gam? You might wear out your index-finger running\\nup and down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word.\\nDr. Johnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster’s ark\\ndoes not hold it. Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now\\nfor many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand\\ntrue born Yankees. Certainly, it needs a definition, and should be\\nincorporated into the Lexicon. With that view, let me learnedly\\ndefine it.\\nGAM. NOUN—A social meeting of two (or more) Whaleships,\\ngenerally on a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they\\nexchange visits by boats’ crews: the two captains remaining, for the\\ntime, on board of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other.\\nThere is another little item about Gamming which must not be\\nforgotten here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of\\ndetail; so has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave\\nship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits\\nin the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat\\nthere, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner’s tiller\\ndecorated with gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no\\nseat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High\\ntimes indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on\\ncastors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller,\\nthe whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy; and therefore\\nas in gamming a complete boat’s crew must leave the ship, and\\nhence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number, that\\nsubordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain,\\nhaving no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a\\npine tree. And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes\\nof the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two\\nships, this standing captain is all alive to the importance of\\nsustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is this any very\\neasy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar\\nhitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after-oar\\nreciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus completely\\nwedged before and behind, and can only expand himself sideways\\nby settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent pitch\\nof the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of\\nfoundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make\\na spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then,\\nagain, it would never do in plain sight of the world’s riveted eyes, it\\nwould never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen\\nsteadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything\\nwith his hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-\\ncommand, he generally carries his hands in his trowsers’ pockets;\\nbut perhaps being generally very large, heavy hands, he carries\\nthem there for ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred instances,\\nwell authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known for\\nan uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say—to\\nseize hold of the nearest oarsman’s hair, and hold on there like grim\\ndeath.\\nCHAPTER 54. The Town-Ho’s\\nStory.\\n(As told at the Golden Inn.)\\nThe Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about\\nthere, is much like some noted four corners of a great highway,\\nwhere you meet more travellers than in any other part.\\nIt was not very long after speaking the Goney that another\\nhomeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She\\nwas manned almost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam that\\nensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick. To some the general\\ninterest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a\\ncircumstance of the Town-Ho’s story, which seemed obscurely to\\ninvolve with the whale a certain wondrous, inverted visitation of one\\nof those so called judgments of God which at times are said to\\novertake some men. This latter circumstance, with its own particular\\naccompaniments, forming what may be called the secret part of the\\ntragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears of Captain\\nAhab or his mates. For that secret part of the story was unknown to\\nthe captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of\\nthree confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it\\nseems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of\\nsecrecy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and\\nrevealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he\\ncould not well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an\\ninfluence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who\\ncame to the full knowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to\\ncall it so, were they governed in this matter, that they kept the\\nsecret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the\\nPequod’s main-mast. Interweaving in its proper place this darker\\nthread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of\\nthis strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record.\\n*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-\\nhead, still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos\\nterrapin.\\nFor my humor’s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once\\nnarrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one\\nsaint’s eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden\\nInn. Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian,\\nwere on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding\\nquestions they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the\\ntime.\\n“Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am\\nabout rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of\\nNantucket, was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days’ sail\\neastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was\\nsomewhere to the northward of the Line. One morning upon\\nhandling the pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed that\\nshe made more water in her hold than common. They supposed a\\nsword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But the captain, having\\nsome unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him\\nin those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to quit them, and\\nthe leak not being then considered at all dangerous, though,\\nindeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low down\\nas was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her\\ncruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy\\nintervals; but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only\\nwas the leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much\\nso, that now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood\\naway for the nearest harbor among the islands, there to have his\\nhull hove out and repaired.\\n“Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest\\nchance favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder\\nby the way, because his pumps were of the best, and being\\nperiodically relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could\\neasily keep the ship free; never mind if the leak should double on\\nher. In truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by\\nvery prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived\\nin perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least\\nfatality, had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the\\nmate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt,\\na Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.\\n“‘Lakeman!—Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is\\nBuffalo?’ said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.\\n“On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but—I crave your\\ncourtesy—may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,\\ngentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as\\nlarge and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far\\nManilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had\\nyet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions\\npopularly connected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing\\naggregate, those grand fresh-water seas of ours,—Erie, and Ontario,\\nand Huron, and Superior, and Michigan,—possess an ocean-like\\nexpansiveness, with many of the ocean’s noblest traits; with many of\\nits rimmed varieties of races and of climes. They contain round\\narchipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in\\nlarge part, are shored by two great contrasting nations, as the\\nAtlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous\\nterritorial colonies from the East, dotted all round their banks; here\\nand there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like\\ncraggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet\\nthunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches\\nto wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their\\npeltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and\\nunentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of\\nkings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric\\nbeasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes\\nto Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and\\nCleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the full-\\nrigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer,\\nand the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting\\nblasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what\\nshipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have\\ndrowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus,\\ngentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and\\nwild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And\\nfor Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down on\\nthe lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in\\nafter life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your\\ncontemplative Pacific; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social\\nquarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-\\nhorn handled Bowie-knives. Yet was this Nantucketer a man with\\nsome good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a mariner, who though\\na sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible firmness, only\\ntempered by that common decency of human recognition which is\\nthe meanest slave’s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been\\nretained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved so thus\\nfar; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt—but,\\ngentlemen, you shall hear.\\n“It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing\\nher prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho’s leak seemed\\nagain increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the\\npumps every day. You must know that in a settled and civilized\\nocean like our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of\\npumping their whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night,\\nshould the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that\\nrespect, the probability would be that he and his shipmates would\\nnever again remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding\\nto the bottom. Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to\\nthe westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep\\nclanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of\\nconsiderable length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible\\ncoast, or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only\\nwhen a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those\\nwaters, some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel\\na little anxious.\\n“Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak\\nwas found gaining once more, there was in truth some small\\nconcern manifested by several of her company; especially by Radney\\nthe mate. He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted,\\nsheeted home anew, and every way expanded to the breeze. Now\\nthis Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and as little\\ninclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own\\nperson as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or on sea that\\nyou can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he\\nbetrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the\\nseamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part\\nowner in her. So when they were working that evening at the\\npumps, there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going\\non among them, as they stood with their feet continually\\noverflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any mountain\\nspring, gentlemen—that bubbling from the pumps ran across the\\ndeck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-\\nholes.\\n“Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this\\nconventional world of ours—watery or otherwise; that when a\\nperson placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them\\nto be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood,\\nstraightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike\\nand bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and\\npulverize that subaltern’s tower, and make a little heap of dust of it.\\nBe this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt\\nwas a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and a flowing\\ngolden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy’s\\nsnorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him,\\ngentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been\\nborn son to Charlemagne’s father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly as\\na mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love\\nSteelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.\\n“Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump\\nwith the rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed,\\nwent on with his gay banterings.\\n“‘Aye, aye, my merry lads, it’s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,\\none of ye, and let’s have a taste. By the Lord, it’s worth bottling! I\\ntell ye what, men, old Rad’s investment must go for it! he had best\\ncut away his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that\\nsword-fish only began the job; he’s come back again with a gang of\\nship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole\\nposse of ’em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the\\nbottom; making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now,\\nI’d tell him to jump overboard and scatter ’em. They’re playing the\\ndevil with his estate, I can tell him. But he’s a simple old soul,—Rad,\\nand a beauty too. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested\\nin looking-glasses. I wonder if he’d give a poor devil like me the\\nmodel of his nose.’\\n“‘Damn your eyes! what’s that pump stopping for?’ roared Radney,\\npretending not to have heard the sailors’ talk. ‘Thunder away at it!’\\n“‘Aye, aye, sir,’ said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. ‘Lively, boys, lively,\\nnow!’ And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines; the\\nmen tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of\\nthe lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life’s\\nutmost energies.\\n“Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman\\nwent forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his\\nface fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat\\nfrom his brow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that\\npossessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally\\nexasperated state, I know not; but so it happened. Intolerably\\nstriding along the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom\\nand sweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and remove some\\noffensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.\\n“Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of\\nhousehold work which in all times but raging gales is regularly\\nattended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the\\ncase of ships actually foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is\\nthe inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in\\nseamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first\\nwashing their faces. But in all vessels this broom business is the\\nprescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard. Besides, it\\nwas the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into\\ngangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic\\nseaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of\\none of the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any\\ntrivial business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being\\nthe case with his comrades. I mention all these particulars so that\\nyou may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two\\nmen.\\n“But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was\\nalmost as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though\\nRadney had spat in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a\\nwhale-ship will understand this; and all this and doubtless much\\nmore, the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his\\ncommand. But as he sat still for a moment, and as he steadfastly\\nlooked into the mate’s malignant eye and perceived the stacks of\\npowder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently burning\\nalong towards them; as he instinctively saw all this, that strange\\nforbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness\\nin any already ireful being—a repugnance most felt, when felt at all,\\nby really valiant men even when aggrieved—this nameless phantom\\nfeeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.\\n“Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\\nexhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that\\nsweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.\\nAnd then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three\\nlads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the\\npumps, had done little or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied\\nwith an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner\\nunconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing\\nupon the still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper’s club\\nhammer which he had snatched from a cask near by.\\n“Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the\\npumps, for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating\\nSteelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow\\nstill smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he\\nremained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed\\nRadney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously\\ncommanding him to do his bidding.\\n“Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\\nfollowed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately\\nrepeated his intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his\\nforbearance had not the slightest effect, by an awful and\\nunspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the\\nfoolish and infatuated man; but it was to no purpose. And in this\\nway the two went once slowly round the windlass; when, resolved at\\nlast no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had now forborne\\nas much as comported with his humor, the Lakeman paused on the\\nhatches and thus spoke to the officer:\\n“‘Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look\\nto yourself.’ But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him,\\nwhere the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer\\nwithin an inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of\\ninsufferable maledictions. Retreating not the thousandth part of an\\ninch; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his\\nglance, Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly\\ndrawing it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed\\nhis cheek he (Steelkilt) would murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool\\nhad been branded for the slaughter by the gods. Immediately the\\nhammer touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the\\nmate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like\\na whale.\\n“Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the\\nbackstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were\\nstanding their mastheads. They were both Canallers.\\n“‘Canallers!’ cried Don Pedro. ‘We have seen many whale-ships in\\nour harbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and\\nwhat are they?’\\n“‘Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie\\nCanal. You must have heard of it.’\\n“‘Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and\\nhereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous North.’\\n“‘Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha’s very fine; and\\nere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such\\ninformation may throw side-light upon my story.’\\n“For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire\\nbreadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities\\nand most thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited\\nswamps, and affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by\\nbilliard-room and bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great\\nforests; on Roman arches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade;\\nby happy hearts or broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery\\nof those noble Mohawk counties; and especially, by rows of snow-\\nwhite chapels, whose spires stand almost like milestones, flows one\\ncontinual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life. There’s\\nyour true Ashantee, gentlemen; there howl your pagans; where you\\never find them, next door to you; under the long-flung shadow, and\\nthe snug patronising lee of churches. For by some curious fatality, as\\nit is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever\\nencamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen, most\\nabound in holiest vicinities.\\n“‘Is that a friar passing?’ said Don Pedro, looking downwards into\\nthe crowded plazza, with humorous concern.\\n“‘Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella’s Inquisition wanes in\\nLima,’ laughed Don Sebastian. ‘Proceed, Senor.’\\n“‘A moment! Pardon!’ cried another of the company. ‘In the name\\nof all us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we\\nhave by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting\\npresent Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do\\nnot bow and look surprised; you know the proverb all along this\\ncoast—“Corrupt as Lima.” It but bears out your saying, too; churches\\nmore plentiful than billiard-tables, and for ever open—and “Corrupt\\nas Lima.” So, too, Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the\\nblessed evangelist, St. Mark!—St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup!\\nThanks: here I refill; now, you pour out again.’\\n“Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller\\nwould make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely\\nwicked is he. Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-\\nturfed, flowery Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-\\ncheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck.\\nBut ashore, all this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which\\nthe Canaller so proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat\\nbetoken his grand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the\\nvillages through which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger\\nare not unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I\\nhave received good turns from one of these Canallers; I thank him\\nheartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the\\nprime redeeming qualities of your man of violence, that at times he\\nhas as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder\\na wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal\\nlife is, is emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery\\ncontains so many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any\\nrace of mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our\\nwhaling captains. Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this\\nmatter, that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men\\nborn along its line, the probationary life of the Grand Canal\\nfurnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian\\ncorn-field, and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric\\nseas.\\n“‘I see! I see!’ impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his\\nchicha upon his silvery ruffles. ‘No need to travel! The world’s one\\nLima. I had thought, now, that at your temperate North the\\ngenerations were cold and holy as the hills.—But the story.’\\n“I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay.\\nHardly had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior\\nmates and the four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck.\\nBut sliding down the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers\\nrushed into the uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it\\ntowards the forecastle. Others of the sailors joined with them in this\\nattempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm’s\\nway, the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike,\\ncalling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and\\nsmoke him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up\\nto the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the heart\\nof it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment.\\nBut Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they\\nsucceeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing\\nabout three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these\\nsea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.\\n“‘Come out of that, ye pirates!’ roared the captain, now menacing\\nthem with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward.\\n‘Come out of that, ye cut-throats!’\\n“Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down\\nthere, defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to\\nunderstand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt’s) death would be the signal\\nfor a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart\\nlest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but\\nstill commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.\\n“‘Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?’ demanded their\\nringleader.\\n“‘Turn to! turn to!—I make no promise;—to your duty! Do you\\nwant to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!’\\nand he once more raised a pistol.\\n“‘Sink the ship?’ cried Steelkilt. ‘Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us\\nturns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What\\nsay ye, men?’ turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their\\nresponse.\\n“The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping\\nhis eye on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:\\n—‘It’s not our fault; we didn’t want it; I told him to take his hammer\\naway; it was boy’s business; he might have known me before this; I\\ntold him not to prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger\\nhere against his cursed jaw; ain’t those mincing knives down in the\\nforecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties.\\nCaptain, by God, look to yourself; say the word; don’t be a fool;\\nforget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we’re\\nyour men; but we won’t be flogged.’\\n“‘Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!’\\n“‘Look ye, now,’ cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards\\nhim, ‘there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have\\nshipped for the cruise, d’ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can\\nclaim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don’t\\nwant a row; it’s not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are\\nready to work, but we won’t be flogged.’\\n“‘Turn to!’ roared the Captain.\\n“Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:—‘I tell you\\nwhat it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a\\nshabby rascal, we won’t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us;\\nbut till you say the word about not flogging us, we don’t do a\\nhand’s turn.’\\n“‘Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I’ll keep ye there\\ntill ye’re sick of it. Down ye go.’\\n“‘Shall we?’ cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were\\nagainst it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded\\nhim down into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears\\ninto a cave.\\n“As the Lakeman’s bare head was just level with the planks, the\\nCaptain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing\\nover the slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it,\\nand loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock\\nbelonging to the companionway. Then opening the slide a little, the\\nCaptain whispered something down the crack, closed it, and turned\\nthe key upon them—ten in number—leaving on deck some twenty\\nor more, who thus far had remained neutral.\\n“All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward\\nand aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at\\nwhich last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after\\nbreaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness\\npassed in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling\\nhard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through\\nthe dreary night dismally resounded through the ship.\\n“At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,\\nsummoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused.\\nWater was then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of\\nbiscuit were tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them\\nand pocketing it, the Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice\\nevery day for three days this was repeated; but on the fourth\\nmorning a confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as\\nthe customary summons was delivered; and suddenly four men\\nburst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to. The\\nfetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to\\nsome fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to\\nsurrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated\\nhis demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint\\nto stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged. On the\\nfifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air\\nfrom the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them. Only\\nthree were left.\\n“‘Better turn to, now?’ said the Captain with a heartless jeer.\\n“‘Shut us up again, will ye!’ cried Steelkilt.\\n“‘Oh certainly,’ said the Captain, and the key clicked.\\n“It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of\\nseven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that\\nhad last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a\\nplace as black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt\\nproposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with\\nhim, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the\\ngarrison; and armed with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic,\\nheavy implements with a handle at each end) run amuck from the\\nbowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation\\npossible, seize the ship. For himself, he would do this, he said,\\nwhether they joined him or not. That was the last night he should\\nspend in that den. But the scheme met with no opposition on the\\npart of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for\\nany other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender. And\\nwhat was more, they each insisted upon being the first man on\\ndeck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to this their\\nleader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself;\\nparticularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the\\nother, in the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the\\nladder would but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen,\\nthe foul play of these miscreants must come out.\\n“Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own\\nseparate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same\\npiece of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order\\nto be the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender;\\nand thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct\\nmight merit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination still\\nto lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle\\nchemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together;\\nand when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to\\neach other in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords,\\nand gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at\\nmidnight.\\n“Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood,\\nhe and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the\\nforecastle. In a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound\\nhand and foot, the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the\\nair by his perfidious allies, who at once claimed the honor of\\nsecuring a man who had been fully ripe for murder. But all these\\nwere collared, and dragged along the deck like dead cattle; and,\\nside by side, were seized up into the mizzen rigging, like three\\nquarters of meat, and there they hung till morning. ‘Damn ye,’ cried\\nthe Captain, pacing to and fro before them, ‘the vultures would not\\ntouch ye, ye villains!’\\n“At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who\\nhad rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he\\ntold the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round—\\nthought, upon the whole, he would do so—he ought to—justice\\ndemanded it; but for the present, considering their timely surrender,\\nhe would let them go with a reprimand, which he accordingly\\nadministered in the vernacular.\\n“‘But as for you, ye carrion rogues,’ turning to the three men in\\nthe rigging—‘for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;’ and,\\nseizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the\\ntwo traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads\\nsideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.\\n“‘My wrist is sprained with ye!’ he cried, at last; ‘but there is still\\nrope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn’t give up.\\nTake that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for\\nhimself.’\\n“For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion\\nof his cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said\\nin a sort of hiss, ‘What I say is this—and mind it well—if you flog\\nme, I murder you!’\\n“‘Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me’—and the Captain drew\\noff with the rope to strike.\\n“‘Best not,’ hissed the Lakeman.\\n“‘But I must,’—and the rope was once more drawn back for the\\nstroke.\\n“Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the\\nCaptain; who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced\\nthe deck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing\\ndown his rope, said, ‘I won’t do it—let him go—cut him down: d’ye\\nhear?’\\n“But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a\\npale man, with a bandaged head, arrested them—Radney the chief\\nmate. Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that\\nmorning, hearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and\\nthus far had watched the whole scene. Such was the state of his\\nmouth, that he could hardly speak; but mumbling something about\\nhis being willing and able to do what the captain dared not\\nattempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.\\n“‘You are a coward!’ hissed the Lakeman.\\n“‘So I am, but take that.’ The mate was in the very act of striking,\\nwhen another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then\\npausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt’s threat,\\nwhatever that might have been. The three men were then cut down,\\nall hands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody\\nseamen, the iron pumps clanged as before.\\n“Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a\\nclamor was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors\\nrunning up, besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort\\nwith the crew. Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back,\\nso at their own instance they were put down in the ship’s run for\\nsalvation. Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the\\ncontrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt’s instigation, they had\\nresolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to\\nthe last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body. But\\nin order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed\\nto another thing—namely, not to sing out for whales, in case any\\nshould be discovered. For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her\\nother perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her\\ncaptain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on\\nthe day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the\\nmate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with\\nhis bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.\\n“But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this\\nsort of passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at\\nleast till all was over) concerning his own proper and private\\nrevenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his\\nheart. He was in Radney the chief mate’s watch; and as if the\\ninfatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his\\ndoom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express\\ncounsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at\\nnight. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt\\nsystematically built the plan of his revenge.\\n“During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on\\nthe bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the\\ngunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the\\nship’s side. In this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed.\\nThere was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship,\\nand down between this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time,\\nand found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two\\no’clock, in the morning of the third day from that in which he had\\nbeen betrayed. At his leisure, he employed the interval in braiding\\nsomething very carefully in his watches below.\\n“‘What are you making there?’ said a shipmate.\\n“‘What do you think? what does it look like?’\\n“‘Like a lanyard for your bag; but it’s an odd one, seems to me.’\\n“‘Yes, rather oddish,’ said the Lakeman, holding it at arm’s length\\nbefore him; ‘but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven’t enough\\ntwine,—have you any?’\\n“But there was none in the forecastle.\\n“‘Then I must get some from old Rad;’ and he rose to go aft.\\n“‘You don’t mean to go a begging to him!’ said a sailor.\\n“‘Why not? Do you think he won’t do me a turn, when it’s to help\\nhimself in the end, shipmate?’ and going to the mate, he looked at\\nhim quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It\\nwas given him—neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the\\nnext night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket\\nof the Lakeman’s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his\\nhammock for a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent\\nhelm—nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always\\nready dug to the seaman’s hand—that fatal hour was then to come;\\nand in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already\\nstark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.\\n“But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the\\nbloody deed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and\\nwithout being the avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself\\nseemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the\\ndamning thing he would have done.\\n“It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the\\nsecond day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid\\nTeneriffe man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted\\nout, ‘There she rolls! there she rolls!’ Jesu, what a whale! It was\\nMoby Dick.\\n“‘Moby Dick!’ cried Don Sebastian; ‘St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do\\nwhales have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?’\\n“‘A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster,\\nDon;—but that would be too long a story.’\\n“‘How? how?’ cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.\\n“‘Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me\\nget more into the air, Sirs.’\\n“‘The chicha! the chicha!’ cried Don Pedro; ‘our vigorous friend\\nlooks faint;—fill up his empty glass!’\\n“No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.—Now,\\ngentlemen, so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty\\nyards of the ship—forgetful of the compact among the crew—in the\\nexcitement of the moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and\\ninvoluntarily lifted his voice for the monster, though for some little\\ntime past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-\\nheads. All was now a phrensy. ‘The White Whale—the White Whale!’\\nwas the cry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred\\nby fearful rumours, were all anxious to capture so famous and\\nprecious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with\\ncurses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a\\nhorizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in\\nthe blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the\\nwhole career of these events, as if verily mapped out before the\\nworld itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of the\\nmate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him, while\\nRadney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or slacken\\nthe line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats\\nwere lowered, the mate’s got the start; and none howled more\\nfiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After\\na stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney\\nsprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a\\nboat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale’s\\ntopmost back. Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up,\\nthrough a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of\\na sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling\\nover, spilled out the standing mate. That instant, as he fell on the\\nwhale’s slippery back, the boat righted, and was dashed aside by\\nthe swell, while Radney was tossed over into the sea, on the other\\nflank of the whale. He struck out through the spray, and, for an\\ninstant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly seeking to remove\\nhimself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed round in a\\nsudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and\\nrearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.\\n“Meantime, at the first tap of the boat’s bottom, the Lakeman had\\nslackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly\\nlooking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific,\\ndownward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line.\\nHe cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick\\nrose again, with some tatters of Radney’s red woollen shirt, caught\\nin the teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase\\nagain; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.\\n“In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary\\nplace—where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the\\nLakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately\\ndeserted among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a\\nlarge double war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some\\nother harbor.\\n“The ship’s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain\\ncalled upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of\\nheaving down the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting\\nvigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites\\nnecessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the\\nhard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again\\nfor sea, they were in such a weakened condition that the captain\\ndurst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel. After taking\\ncounsel with his officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as\\npossible; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked\\nhis muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders not to\\napproach the ship at their peril, took one man with him, and setting\\nthe sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for\\nTahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his\\ncrew.\\n“On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which\\nseemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away\\nfrom it; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice\\nof Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water.\\nThe captain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the\\nyoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him\\nthat if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him\\nin bubbles and foam.\\n“‘What do you want of me?’ cried the captain.\\n“‘Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?’ demanded\\nSteelkilt; ‘no lies.’\\n“‘I am bound to Tahiti for more men.’\\n“‘Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.’ With\\nthat he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the\\ngunwale, stood face to face with the captain.\\n“‘Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after\\nme. As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on\\nyonder island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings\\nstrike me!’\\n“‘A pretty scholar,’ laughed the Lakeman. ‘Adios, Senor!’ and\\nleaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.\\n“Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the\\nroots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due\\ntime arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck\\nbefriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were\\nprovidentially in want of precisely that number of men which the\\nsailor headed. They embarked; and so for ever got the start of their\\nformer captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal\\nretribution.\\n“Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat\\narrived, and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more\\ncivilized Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea.\\nChartering a small native schooner, he returned with them to his\\nvessel; and finding all right there, again resumed his cruisings.\\n“Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the\\nisland of Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea\\nwhich refuses to give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful\\nwhite whale that destroyed him. * * * *\\n“‘Are you through?’ said Don Sebastian, quietly.\\n“‘I am, Don.’\\n“‘Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own\\nconvictions, this your story is in substance really true? It is so\\npassing wonderful! Did you get it from an unquestionable source?\\nBear with me if I seem to press.’\\n“‘Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don\\nSebastian’s suit,’ cried the company, with exceeding interest.\\n“‘Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn,\\ngentlemen?’\\n“‘Nay,’ said Don Sebastian; ‘but I know a worthy priest near by,\\nwho will quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well\\nadvised? this may grow too serious.’\\n“‘Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?’\\n“‘Though there are no Auto-da-Fés in Lima now,’ said one of the\\ncompany to another; ‘I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the\\narchiepiscopacy. Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see\\nno need of this.’\\n“‘Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also\\nbeg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized\\nEvangelists you can.’\\n* * * * * *\\n“‘This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,’ said Don\\nSebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.\\n“‘Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the\\nlight, and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.\\n“‘So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have told ye,\\ngentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be\\ntrue; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I\\nhave seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.’”\\nCHAPTER 55. Of the\\nMonstrous Pictures of Whales.\\nI shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,\\nsomething like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to\\nthe eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale\\nis moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped\\nupon there. It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to\\nthose curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the\\npresent day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is\\ntime to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures\\nof the whale all wrong.\\nIt may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions\\nwill be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian\\nsculptures. For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times\\nwhen on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues,\\nand on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn\\nin scales of chain-armor like Saladin’s, and a helmeted head like St.\\nGeorge’s; ever since then has something of the same sort of license\\nprevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in\\nmany scientific presentations of him.\\nNow, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways\\npurporting to be the whale’s, is to be found in the famous cavern-\\npagoda of Elephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the\\nalmost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades\\nand pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured\\nages before any of them actually came into being. No wonder then,\\nthat in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been\\nthere shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a\\nseparate department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu\\nin the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar. But\\nthough this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give\\nthe tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong. It\\nlooks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad\\npalms of the true whale’s majestic flukes.\\nBut go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian\\npainter’s portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the\\nantediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido’s picture of Perseus rescuing\\nAndromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get\\nthe model of such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in\\npainting the same scene in his own “Perseus Descending,” make out\\none whit better. The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster\\nundulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has\\na sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into\\nwhich the billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors’ Gate\\nleading from the Thames by water into the Tower. Then, there are\\nthe Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah’s whale, as\\ndepicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers.\\nWhat shall be said of these? As for the book-binder’s whale winding\\nlike a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor—as\\nstamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books\\nboth old and new—that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous\\ncreature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.\\nThough universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this\\nbook-binder’s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so\\nintended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by\\nan old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during\\nthe Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\\ncomparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be\\na species of the Leviathan.\\nIn the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books\\nyou will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where\\nall manner of spouts, jets d’eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and\\nBaden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the\\ntitle-page of the original edition of the “Advancement of Learning”\\nyou will find some curious whales.\\nBut quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at\\nthose pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific\\ndelineations, by those who know. In old Harris’s collection of\\nvoyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch\\nbook of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled “A Whaling Voyage to\\nSpitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of\\nFriesland, master.” In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts\\nof logs, are represented lying among ice-isles, with white bears\\nrunning over their living backs. In another plate, the prodigious\\nblunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.\\nThen again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain\\nColnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled “A Voyage round\\nCape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the\\nSpermaceti Whale Fisheries.” In this book is an outline purporting to\\nbe a “Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale\\nfrom one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted\\non deck.” I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken\\nfor the benefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let\\nme say that it has an eye which applied, according to the\\naccompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the\\neye of that whale a bow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant\\ncaptain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye!\\nNor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History\\nfor the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same\\nheinousness of mistake. Look at that popular work “Goldsmith’s\\nAnimated Nature.” In the abridged London edition of 1807, there are\\nplates of an alleged “whale” and a “narwhale.” I do not wish to seem\\ninelegant, but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated\\nsow; and, as for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze\\none, that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be\\npalmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys.\\nThen, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacépède, a\\ngreat naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book,\\nwherein are several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan.\\nAll these are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or\\nGreenland whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a\\nlong experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have\\nits counterpart in nature.\\nBut the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business\\nwas reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the\\nfamous Baron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in\\nwhich he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before\\nshowing that picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for\\nyour summary retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier’s\\nSperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he\\nnever had the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have),\\nbut whence he derived that picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it\\nas his scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of\\nhis authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing. And what\\nsort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer\\ncups and saucers inform us.\\nAs for the sign-painters’ whales seen in the streets hanging over\\nthe shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are\\ngenerally Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very\\nsavage; breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats\\nfull of mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and\\nblue paint.\\nBut these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so\\nvery surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings\\nhave been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as\\ncorrect as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would\\ncorrectly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride\\nof hull and spars. Though elephants have stood for their full-\\nlengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for\\nhis portrait. The living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is\\nonly to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast\\nbulk of him is out of sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and\\nout of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man\\nto hoist him bodily into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty\\nswells and undulations. And, not to speak of the highly presumable\\ndifference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full-\\ngrown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of those\\nyoung sucking whales hoisted to a ship’s deck, such is then the\\noutlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise\\nexpression the devil himself could not catch.\\nBut it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the\\nstranded whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true\\nform. Not at all. For it is one of the more curious things about this\\nLeviathan, that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general\\nshape. Though Jeremy Bentham’s skeleton, which hangs for\\ncandelabra in the library of one of his executors, correctly conveys\\nthe idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all\\nJeremy’s other leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this\\nkind could be inferred from any leviathan’s articulated bones. In fact,\\nas the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the\\nsame relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect\\ndoes to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity\\nis strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will be\\nincidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin,\\nthe bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the\\nhuman hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four regular bone-\\nfingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all these are\\npermanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human fingers in\\nan artificial covering. “However recklessly the whale may sometimes\\nserve us,” said humorous Stubb one day, “he can never be truly said\\nto handle us without mittens.”\\nFor all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must\\nneeds conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the\\nworld which must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait\\nmay hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with\\nany very considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly\\nway of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like. And\\nthe only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his\\nliving contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you\\nrun no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him.\\nWherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in\\nyour curiosity touching this Leviathan.\\nCHAPTER 56. Of the Less\\nErroneous Pictures of Whales,\\nand the True Pictures of\\nWhaling Scenes.\\nIn connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly\\ntempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of\\nthem which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and\\nmodern, especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But\\nI pass that matter by.\\nI know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;\\nColnett’s, Huggins’s, Frederick Cuvier’s, and Beale’s. In the previous\\nchapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins’s is far\\nbetter than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale’s is the best. All Beale’s\\ndrawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in the\\npicture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second\\nchapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no\\ndoubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is\\nadmirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the\\nSperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in\\ncontour; but they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault\\nthough.\\nOf the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but\\nthey are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable\\nimpression. He has but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a\\nsad deficiency, because it is by such pictures only, when at all well\\ndone, that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living\\nwhale as seen by his living hunters.\\nBut, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details\\nnot the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to\\nbe anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed,\\nand taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they\\nrepresent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first\\nengraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might,\\njust risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and\\nbearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven\\nplanks. The prow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just\\nbalancing upon the monster’s spine; and standing in that prow, for\\nthat one single incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman,\\nhalf shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in\\nthe act of leaping, as if from a precipice. The action of the whole\\nthing is wonderfully good and true. The half-emptied line-tub floats\\non the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons\\nobliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered\\nabout the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the\\nblack stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene.\\nSerious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this\\nwhale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw so\\ngood a one.\\nIn the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing\\nalongside the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that\\nrolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide\\nfrom the Patagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot;\\nso that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would\\nthink there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels\\nbelow. Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other\\nsea candies and maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes\\ncarries on his pestilent back. And all the while the thick-lipped\\nleviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous\\nwhite curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock in the\\nswells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean\\nsteamer. Thus, the foreground is all raging commotion; but behind,\\nin admirable artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed,\\nthe drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert\\nmass of a dead whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture\\nlazily hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.\\nWho Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it\\nhe was either practically conversant with his subject, or else\\nmarvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French\\nare the lads for painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings\\nof Europe, and where will you find such a gallery of living and\\nbreathing commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at\\nVersailles; where the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the\\nconsecutive great battles of France; where every sword seems a\\nflash of the Northern Lights, and the successive armed kings and\\nEmperors dash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly\\nunworthy of a place in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of\\nGarnery.\\nThe natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness\\nof things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and\\nengravings they have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of\\nEngland’s experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of\\nthat of the Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both\\nnations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying\\nthe real spirit of the whale hunt. For the most part, the English and\\nAmerican whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting\\nthe mechanical outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the\\nwhale; which, so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is\\nabout tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid. Even\\nScoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman, after giving us a stiff\\nfull length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate\\nminiatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of\\nclassical engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels;\\nand with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to\\nthe inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of\\nmagnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement to the\\nexcellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so important a\\nmatter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every\\ncrystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the\\nPeace.\\nIn addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two\\nother French engravings worthy of note, by some one who\\nsubscribes himself “H. Durand.” One of them, though not precisely\\nadapted to our present purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on\\nother accounts. It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the\\nPacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily\\ntaking water on board; the loosened sails of the ship, and the long\\nleaves of the palms in the background, both drooping together in\\nthe breezeless air. The effect is very fine, when considered with\\nreference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their\\nfew aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving is quite a\\ndifferent affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very\\nheart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the\\nvessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a\\nquay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is\\nabout giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and\\nlances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in\\nits hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands\\nhalf-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the\\nsmoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the\\nsmoke over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud,\\nrising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the\\nactivity of the excited seamen.\\nCHAPTER 57. Of Whales in\\nPaint; in Teeth; in Wood; in\\nSheet-Iron; in Stone; in\\nMountains; in Stars.\\nOn Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may\\nhave seen a crippled beggar (or kedger, as the sailors say) holding a\\npainted board before him, representing the tragic scene in which he\\nlost his leg. There are three whales and three boats; and one of the\\nboats (presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original\\nintegrity) is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any\\ntime these ten years, they tell me, has that man held up that\\npicture, and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world. But the\\ntime of his justification has now come. His three whales are as good\\nwhales as were ever published in Wapping, at any rate; and his\\nstump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the\\nwestern clearings. But, though for ever mounted on that stump,\\nnever a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with\\ndowncast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation.\\nThroughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford,\\nand Sag Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and\\nwhaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm\\nWhale-teeth, or ladies’ busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone,\\nand other like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the\\nnumerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of\\nthe rough material, in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them\\nhave little boxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially\\nintended for the skrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil\\nwith their jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool\\nof the sailor, they will turn you out anything you please, in the way\\nof a mariner’s fancy.\\nLong exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a\\nman to that condition in which God placed him, i.e. what is called\\nsavagery. Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an\\nIroquois. I myself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the King\\nof the Cannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.\\nNow, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his\\ndomestic hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient\\nHawaiian war-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and\\nelaboration of carving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance\\nas a Latin lexicon. For, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark’s\\ntooth, that miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been\\nachieved; and it has cost steady years of steady application.\\nAs with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With\\nthe same marvellous patience, and with the same single shark’s\\ntooth, of his one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone\\nsculpture, not quite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its\\nmaziness of design, as the Greek savage, Achilles’s shield; and full of\\nbarbaric spirit and suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old\\nDutch savage, Albert Durer.\\nWooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark\\nslabs of the noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in\\nthe forecastles of American whalers. Some of them are done with\\nmuch accuracy.\\nAt some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass\\nwhales hung by the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When\\nthe porter is sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. But\\nthese knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays. On\\nthe spires of some old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron\\nwhales placed there for weather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and\\nbesides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with “Hands\\noff!” you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their\\nmerit.\\nIn bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high\\nbroken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon\\nthe plain, you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of\\nthe Leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks\\nagainst them in a surf of green surges.\\nThen, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is\\ncontinually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from\\nsome lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the\\nprofiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges. But you must\\nbe a thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but\\nif you wish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and\\ntake the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-\\npoint, else so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that\\nyour precise, previous stand-point would require a laborious re-\\ndiscovery; like the Soloma Islands, which still remain incognita,\\nthough once high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera\\nchronicled them.\\nNor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace\\nout great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them;\\nas when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw\\narmies locked in battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I\\nchased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of\\nthe bright points that first defined him to me. And beneath the\\neffulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined\\nthe chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of\\nHydrus and the Flying Fish.\\nWith a frigate’s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons\\nfor spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost\\nskies, to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless\\ntents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight!\\nCHAPTER 58. Brit.\\nSteering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast\\nmeadows of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the\\nRight Whale largely feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated\\nround us, so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields\\nof ripe and golden wheat.\\nOn the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who,\\nsecure from the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with\\nopen jaws sluggishly swam through the brit, which, adhering to the\\nfringing fibres of that wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was\\nin that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip.\\nAs morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly\\nadvance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads;\\neven so these monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting\\nsound; and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the\\nyellow sea.*\\n*That part of the sea known among whalemen as the “Brazil\\nBanks” does not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do,\\nbecause of there being shallows and soundings there, but because\\nof this remarkable meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast\\ndrifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes, where the Right\\nWhale is often chased.\\nBut it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit\\nwhich at all reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads,\\nespecially when they paused and were stationary for a while, their\\nvast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than\\nanything else. And as in the great hunting countries of India, the\\nstranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent\\nelephants without knowing them to be such, taking them for bare,\\nblackened elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him, who for\\nthe first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea. And\\neven when recognised at last, their immense magnitude renders it\\nvery hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can\\npossibly be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort of life that lives\\nin a dog or a horse.\\nIndeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of\\nthe deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For\\nthough some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of\\nthe land are of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad\\ngeneral view of the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to\\nspecialties, where, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that\\nin disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog? The\\naccursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear\\ncomparative analogy to him.\\nBut though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the\\nseas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial\\nand repelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra\\nincognita, so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds\\nto discover his one superficial western one; though, by vast odds,\\nthe most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and\\nindiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those\\nwho have gone upon the waters; though but a moment’s\\nconsideration will teach, that however baby man may brag of his\\nscience and skill, and however much, in a flattering future, that\\nscience and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever, to the\\ncrack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize the\\nstateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual\\nrepetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense of the\\nfull awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.\\nThe first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with\\nPortuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving\\nso much as a widow. That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean\\ndestroyed the wrecked ships of last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah’s\\nflood is not yet subsided; two thirds of the fair world it yet covers.\\nWherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is\\nnot a miracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the\\nHebrews, when under the feet of Korah and his company the live\\nground opened and swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern\\nsun ever sets, but in precisely the same manner the live sea\\nswallows up ships and crews.\\nBut not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it,\\nbut it is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian\\nhost who murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which\\nitself hath spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle\\noverlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales\\nagainst the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split\\nwrecks of ships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting\\nand snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the\\nmasterless ocean overruns the globe.\\nConsider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded\\ncreatures glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and\\ntreacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider\\nalso the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most\\nremorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species\\nof sharks. Consider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea;\\nall whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war\\nsince the world began.\\nConsider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most\\ndocile earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you\\nnot find a strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this\\nappalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man\\nthere lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed\\nby all the horrors of the half known life. God keep thee! Push not\\noff from that isle, thou canst never return!\\nCHAPTER 59. Squid.\\nSlowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held\\non her way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air\\nimpelling her keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall\\ntapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild\\npalms on a plain. And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the\\nlonely, alluring jet would be seen.\\nBut one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost\\npreternatural spread over the sea, however unattended with any\\nstagnant calm; when the long burnished sun-glade on the waters\\nseemed a golden finger laid across them, enjoining some secrecy;\\nwhen the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on;\\nin this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was\\nseen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.\\nIn the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher\\nand higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed\\nbefore our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus\\nglistening for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once\\nmore arose, and silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is\\nthis Moby Dick? thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down,\\nbut on re-appearing once more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled\\nevery man from his nod, the negro yelled out—“There! there again!\\nthere she breaches! right ahead! The White Whale, the White\\nWhale!”\\nUpon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-\\ntime the bees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun,\\nAhab stood on the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind\\nin readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman, cast his eager\\nglance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched\\nmotionless arm of Daggoo.\\nWhether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet\\nhad gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to\\nconnect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the\\nparticular whale he pursued; however this was, or whether his\\neagerness betrayed him; whichever way it might have been, no\\nsooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass, than with a quick\\nintensity he instantly gave orders for lowering.\\nThe four boats were soon on the water; Ahab’s in advance, and all\\nswiftly pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while,\\nwith oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the\\nsame spot where it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost\\nforgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now\\ngazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas\\nhave hitherto revealed to mankind. A vast pulpy mass, furlongs in\\nlength and breadth, of a glancing cream-colour, lay floating on the\\nwater, innumerable long arms radiating from its centre, and curling\\nand twisting like a nest of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any\\nhapless object within reach. No perceptible face or front did it have;\\nno conceivable token of either sensation or instinct; but undulated\\nthere on the billows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition\\nof life.\\nAs with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck\\nstill gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild\\nvoice exclaimed—“Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought\\nhim, than to have seen thee, thou white ghost!”\\n“What was it, Sir?” said Flask.\\n“The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever\\nbeheld, and returned to their ports to tell of it.”\\nBut Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the\\nvessel; the rest as silently following.\\nWhatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have\\nconnected with the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse\\nof it being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest\\nit with portentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one and\\nall of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean,\\nyet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning\\nits true nature and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish\\nto the sperm whale his only food. For though other species of\\nwhales find their food above water, and may be seen by man in the\\nact of feeding, the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in\\nunknown zones below the surface; and only by inference is it that\\nany one can tell of what, precisely, that food consists. At times,\\nwhen closely pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the\\ndetached arms of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding\\ntwenty and thirty feet in length. They fancy that the monster to\\nwhich these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of\\nthe ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other species, is\\nsupplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.\\nThere seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of\\nBishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The\\nmanner in which the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and\\nsinking, with some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two\\ncorrespond. But much abatement is necessary with respect to the\\nincredible bulk he assigns it.\\nBy some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the\\nmysterious creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class\\nof cuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would\\nseem to belong, but only as the Anak of the tribe.\\nCHAPTER 60. The Line.\\nWith reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as\\nwell as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere\\npresented, I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible\\nwhale-line.\\nThe line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp,\\nslightly vapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of\\nordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp\\nmore pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself\\nmore convenient to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only\\nwould the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the\\nclose coiling to which it must be subjected; but as most seamen are\\nbeginning to learn, tar in general by no means adds to the rope’s\\ndurability or strength, however much it may give it compactness\\nand gloss.\\nOf late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost\\nentirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though\\nnot so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic;\\nand I will add (since there is an æsthetics in all things), is much\\nmore handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a\\ndusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired\\nCircassian to behold.\\nThe whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first\\nsight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment\\nits one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred\\nand twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly\\nequal to three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line\\nmeasures something over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern\\nof the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-\\npipe of a still though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped\\nmass of densely bedded “sheaves,” or layers of concentric\\nspiralizations, without any hollow but the “heart,” or minute vertical\\ntube formed at the axis of the cheese. As the least tangle or kink in\\nthe coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody’s arm,\\nleg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the\\nline in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire\\nmorning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then\\nreeving it downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the\\nact of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.\\nIn the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same\\nline being continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some\\nadvantage in this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit\\nmore readily into the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas,\\nthe American tub, nearly three feet in diameter and of\\nproportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose\\nplanks are but one half-inch in thickness; for the bottom of the\\nwhale-boat is like critical ice, which will bear up a considerable\\ndistributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated one. When\\nthe painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line-tub, the\\nboat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding-\\ncake to present to the whales.\\nBoth ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in\\nan eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side\\nof the tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from\\neverything. This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two\\naccounts. First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an\\nadditional line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale\\nshould sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line\\noriginally attached to the harpoon. In these instances, the whale of\\ncourse is shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to\\nthe other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its\\nconsort. Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common\\nsafety’s sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached\\nto the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end\\nalmost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would\\nnot stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged\\ndown after him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no\\ntown-crier would ever find her again.\\nBefore lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line\\nis taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there,\\nis again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting\\ncrosswise upon the loom or handle of every man’s oar, so that it\\njogs against his wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men,\\nas they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded\\nchocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a\\nwooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from\\nslipping out. From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the\\nbows, and is then passed inside the boat again; and some ten or\\ntwenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the\\nbows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and\\nis then attached to the short-warp—the rope which is immediately\\nconnected with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the\\nshort-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.\\nThus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,\\ntwisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the\\noarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid\\neye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the\\ndeadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son\\nof mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen\\nintricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him\\nthat at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all\\nthese horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he\\ncannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the\\nvery marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet\\nhabit—strange thing! what cannot habit accomplish?—Gayer sallies,\\nmore merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never\\nheard over your mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch\\nwhite cedar of the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman’s\\nnooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais before King Edward, the\\nsix men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death, with a\\nhalter around every neck, as you may say.\\nPerhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for\\nthose repeated whaling disasters—some few of which are casually\\nchronicled—of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by\\nthe line, and lost. For, when the line is darting out, to be seated\\nthen in the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold\\nwhizzings of a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam,\\nand shaft, and wheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit\\nmotionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking\\nlike a cradle, and you are pitched one way and the other, without\\nthe slightest warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy\\nand simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being\\nmade a Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun\\nhimself could never pierce you out.\\nAgain: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and\\nprophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;\\nfor, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm;\\nand contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the\\nfatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose\\nof the line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being\\nbrought into actual play—this is a thing which carries more of true\\nterror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say\\nmore? All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with\\nhalters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift,\\nsudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-\\npresent perils of life. And if you be a philosopher, though seated in\\nthe whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror,\\nthan though seated before your evening fire with a poker, and not a\\nharpoon, by your side.\\nCHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a\\nWhale.\\nIf to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents,\\nto Queequeg it was quite a different object.\\n“When you see him ’quid,” said the savage, honing his harpoon in\\nthe bow of his hoisted boat, “then you quick see him ’parm whale.”\\nThe next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing\\nspecial to engage them, the Pequod’s crew could hardly resist the\\nspell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the\\nIndian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what\\nwhalemen call a lively ground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of\\nporpoises, dolphins, flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of\\nmore stirring waters, than those off the Rio de la Plata, or the in-\\nshore ground off Peru.\\nIt was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my\\nshoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I\\nidly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could\\nwithstand it; in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last\\nmy soul went out of my body; though my body still continued to\\nsway as a pendulum will, long after the power which first moved it\\nis withdrawn.\\nEre forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the\\nseamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy.\\nSo that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for\\nevery swing that we made there was a nod from below from the\\nslumbering helmsman. The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests;\\nand across the wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the\\nsun over all.\\nSuddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like\\nvices my hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious\\nagency preserved me; with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close\\nunder our lee, not forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay\\nrolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad,\\nglossy back, of an Ethiopian hue, glistening in the sun’s rays like a\\nmirror. But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea, and ever and\\nanon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet, the whale looked like a\\nportly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon. But that pipe,\\npoor whale, was thy last. As if struck by some enchanter’s wand, the\\nsleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into\\nwakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the\\nvessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted forth\\nthe accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted\\nthe sparkling brine into the air.\\n“Clear away the boats! Luff!” cried Ahab. And obeying his own\\norder, he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle\\nthe spokes.\\nThe sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the\\nwhale; and ere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam\\naway to the leeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making\\nso few ripples as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as\\nyet be alarmed, Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used,\\nand no man must speak but in whispers. So seated like Ontario\\nIndians on the gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently paddled\\nalong; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set.\\nPresently, as we thus glided in chase, the monster perpendicularly\\nflitted his tail forty feet into the air, and then sank out of sight like a\\ntower swallowed up.\\n“There go flukes!” was the cry, an announcement immediately\\nfollowed by Stubb’s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for\\nnow a respite was granted. After the full interval of his sounding\\nhad elapsed, the whale rose again, and being now in advance of the\\nsmoker’s boat, and much nearer to it than to any of the others,\\nStubb counted upon the honor of the capture. It was obvious, now,\\nthat the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers. All\\nsilence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use. Paddles were\\ndropped, and oars came loudly into play. And still puffing at his\\npipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault.\\nYes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his\\njeopardy, he was going “head out”; that part obliquely projecting\\nfrom the mad yeast which he brewed.*\\n*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance\\nthe entire interior of the sperm whale’s enormous head consists.\\nThough apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant\\npart about him. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and\\ninvariably does so when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is\\nthe breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and such the\\ntapering cut-water formation of the lower part, that by obliquely\\nelevating his head, he thereby may be said to transform himself\\nfrom a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York\\npilot-boat.\\n“Start her, start her, my men! Don’t hurry yourselves; take plenty\\nof time—but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that’s all,” cried\\nStubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. “Start her, now; give\\n’em the long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy—\\nstart her, all; but keep cool, keep cool—cucumbers is the word—\\neasy, easy—only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and\\nraise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves, boys—that’s\\nall. Start her!”\\n“Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!” screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising\\nsome old war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained\\nboat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous\\nleading stroke which the eager Indian gave.\\nBut his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. “Kee-\\nhee! Kee-hee!” yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on\\nhis seat, like a pacing tiger in his cage.\\n“Ka-la! Koo-loo!” howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a\\nmouthful of Grenadier’s steak. And thus with oars and yells the\\nkeels cut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van,\\nstill encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the\\nsmoke from his mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they\\nstrained, till the welcome cry was heard—“Stand up, Tashtego!—give\\nit to him!” The harpoon was hurled. “Stern all!” The oarsmen backed\\nwater; the same moment something went hot and hissing along\\nevery one of their wrists. It was the magical line. An instant before,\\nStubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the\\nloggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a\\nhempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady\\nfumes from his pipe. As the line passed round and round the\\nloggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it blisteringly\\npassed through and through both of Stubb’s hands, from which the\\nhand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these\\ntimes, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy’s\\nsharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time\\nstriving to wrest it out of your clutch.\\n“Wet the line! wet the line!” cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him\\nseated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into\\nit.* More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.\\nThe boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.\\nStubb and Tashtego here changed places—stem for stern—a\\nstaggering business truly in that rocking commotion.\\n*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be\\nstated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the\\nrunning line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or\\nbailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most\\nconvenient.\\nFrom the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper\\npart of the boat, and from its now being more tight than a\\nharpstring, you would have thought the craft had two keels—one\\ncleaving the water, the other the air—as the boat churned on\\nthrough both opposing elements at once. A continual cascade\\nplayed at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at\\nthe slightest motion from within, even but of a little finger, the\\nvibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the\\nsea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main clinging to\\nhis seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall form of\\nTashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order to\\nbring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics\\nseemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale\\nsomewhat slackened his flight.\\n“Haul in—haul in!” cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round\\ntowards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him,\\nwhile yet the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his\\nflank, Stubb, firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart\\nafter dart into the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat\\nalternately sterning out of the way of the whale’s horrible wallow,\\nand then ranging up for another fling.\\nThe red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks\\ndown a hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood,\\nwhich bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The\\nslanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back\\nits reflection into every face, so that they all glowed to each other\\nlike red men. And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was\\nagonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff\\nafter puff from the mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart,\\nhauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb\\nstraightened it again and again, by a few rapid blows against the\\ngunwale, then again and again sent it into the whale.\\n“Pull up—pull up!” he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning\\nwhale relaxed in his wrath. “Pull up!—close to!” and the boat ranged\\nalong the fish’s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly\\nchurned his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there,\\ncarefully churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after\\nsome gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which\\nhe was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold\\nwatch he sought was the innermost life of the fish. And now it is\\nstruck; for, starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing\\ncalled his “flurry,” the monster horribly wallowed in his blood,\\noverwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that\\nthe imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly\\nto struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the\\nday.\\nAnd now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out\\ninto view; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and\\ncontracting \\nhis \\nspout-hole, \\nwith \\nsharp, \\ncracking, \\nagonized\\nrespirations. At last, gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had\\nbeen the purple lees of red wine, shot into the frighted air; and\\nfalling back again, ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the\\nsea. His heart had burst!\\n“He’s dead, Mr. Stubb,” said Daggoo.\\n“Yes; both pipes smoked out!” and withdrawing his own from his\\nmouth, Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a\\nmoment, stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.\\nCHAPTER 62. The Dart.\\nA word concerning an incident in the last chapter.\\nAccording to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat\\npushes off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as\\ntemporary steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling\\nthe foremost oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it\\nneeds a strong, nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for\\noften, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be\\nflung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet. But however\\nprolonged and exhausting the chase, the harpooneer is expected to\\npull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed, he is expected to\\nset an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not only by\\nincredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations;\\nand what it is to keep shouting at the top of one’s compass, while\\nall the other muscles are strained and half started—what that is\\nnone know but those who have tried it. For one, I cannot bawl very\\nheartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time. In this\\nstraining, bawling state, then, with his back to the fish, all at once\\nthe exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry—“Stand up, and\\ngive it to him!” He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round\\non his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with\\nwhat little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into\\nthe whale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a\\nbody, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful;\\nno wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and\\ndisrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood-\\nvessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are\\nabsent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship\\nowners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer\\nthat makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body\\nhow can you expect to find it there when most wanted!\\nAgain, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,\\nthat is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and\\nharpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent\\njeopardy of themselves and every one else. It is then they change\\nplaces; and the headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes\\nhis proper station in the bows of the boat.\\nNow, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both\\nfoolish and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows\\nfrom first to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance,\\nand no rowing whatever should be expected of him, except under\\ncircumstances obvious to any fisherman. I know that this would\\nsometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase; but long\\nexperience in various whalemen of more than one nation has\\nconvinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery, it\\nhas not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the\\nbefore described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused\\nthem.\\nTo insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of\\nthis world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from\\nout of toil.\\nCHAPTER 63. The Crotch.\\nOut of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So,\\nin productive subjects, grow the chapters.\\nThe crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent\\nmention. It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in\\nlength, which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale\\nnear the bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden\\nextremity of the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly\\nprojects from the prow. Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to\\nits hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a\\nbackwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall. It is customary to\\nhave two harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the\\nfirst and second irons.\\nBut these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both\\nconnected with the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if\\npossible, one instantly after the other into the same whale; so that\\nif, in the coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still\\nretain a hold. It is a doubling of the chances. But it very often\\nhappens that owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive\\nrunning of the whale upon receiving the first iron, it becomes\\nimpossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like in his\\nmovements, to pitch the second iron into him. Nevertheless, as the\\nsecond iron is already connected with the line, and the line is\\nrunning, hence that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly\\ntossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else the most\\nterrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the water, it\\naccordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line (mentioned\\nin a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances,\\nprudently practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended\\nwith the saddest and most fatal casualties.\\nFurthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown\\noverboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,\\nskittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the\\nlines, or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all\\ndirections. Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the\\nwhale is fairly captured and a corpse.\\nConsider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all\\nengaging one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when\\nowing to these qualities in him, as well as to the thousand\\nconcurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten\\nloose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him. For,\\nof course, each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on\\nto the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without\\nrecovery. All these particulars are faithfully narrated here, as they will\\nnot fail to elucidate several most important, however intricate\\npassages, in scenes hereafter to be painted.\\nCHAPTER 64. Stubb’s Supper.\\nStubb’s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was\\na calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the\\nslow business of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we\\neighteen men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty\\nthumbs and fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert,\\nsluggish corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all,\\nexcept at long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the\\nenormousness of the mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of\\nHang-Ho, or whatever they call it, in China, four or five laborers on\\nthe foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile\\nan hour; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if\\nladen with pig-lead in bulk.\\nDarkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod’s\\nmain-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab\\ndropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly\\neyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders\\nfor securing it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a\\nseaman, went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward\\nagain until morning.\\nThough, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had\\nevinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the creature\\nwas dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair,\\nseemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body reminded\\nhim that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand\\nother whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot\\nadvance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have\\nthought from the sound on the Pequod’s decks, that all hands were\\npreparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being\\ndragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes.\\nBut by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to\\nbe moored. Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the\\nbows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel’s and\\nseen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars\\nand rigging aloft, the two—ship and whale, seemed yoked together\\nlike colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the other remains\\nstanding.*\\n*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most\\nreliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored\\nalongside, is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density\\nthat part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-\\nfins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the\\nsurface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in\\norder to put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously\\novercome: a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its\\nouter end, and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured\\nto the ship. By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise\\non the other side of the mass, so that now having girdled the\\nwhale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and being slipped\\nalong the body, is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the\\ntail, at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes.\\nIf moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be\\nknown on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest,\\nbetrayed an unusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an\\nunwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck, his official\\nsuperior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management\\nof affairs. One small, helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was\\nsoon made strangely manifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was\\nsomewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to\\nhis palate.\\n“A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and\\ncut me one from his small!”\\nHere be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a\\ngeneral thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the\\nenemy defray the current expenses of the war (at least before\\nrealizing the proceeds of the voyage), yet now and then you find\\nsome of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that\\nparticular part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb; comprising\\nthe tapering extremity of the body.\\nAbout midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by\\ntwo lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti\\nsupper at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard.\\nNor was Stubb the only banqueter on whale’s flesh that night.\\nMingling their mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on\\nthousands of sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly\\nfeasted on its fatness. The few sleepers below in their bunks were\\noften startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull,\\nwithin a few inches of the sleepers’ hearts. Peering over the side\\nyou could just see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in\\nthe sullen, black waters, and turning over on their backs as they\\nscooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a\\nhuman head. This particular feat of the shark seems all but\\nmiraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable surface, they\\ncontrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part\\nof the universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave on\\nthe whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter\\nin countersinking for a screw.\\nThough amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight,\\nsharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship’s decks, like\\nhungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved, ready\\nto bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them; and though,\\nwhile the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally\\ncarving each other’s live meat with carving-knives all gilded and\\ntasselled, the sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are\\nquarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat; and\\nthough, were you to turn the whole affair upside down, it would still\\nbe pretty much the same thing, that is to say, a shocking sharkish\\nbusiness enough for all parties; and though sharks also are the\\ninvariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic,\\nsystematically trotting alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to\\nbe carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently buried; and\\nthough one or two other like instances might be set down, touching\\nthe set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do most socially\\ncongregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable\\ntime or occasion when you will find them in such countless\\nnumbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead\\nsperm whale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have\\nnever seen that sight, then suspend your decision about the\\npropriety of devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the\\ndevil.\\nBut, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that\\nwas going on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the\\nsmacking of his own epicurean lips.\\n“Cook, cook!—where’s that old Fleece?” he cried at length,\\nwidening his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for\\nhis supper; and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if\\nstabbing with his lance; “cook, you cook!—sail this way, cook!”\\nThe old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously\\nroused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came\\nshambling along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was\\nsomething the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep\\nwell scoured like his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him,\\ncame shuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs,\\nwhich, after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron\\nhoops; this old Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the\\nword of command, came to a dead stop on the opposite side of\\nStubb’s sideboard; when, with both hands folded before him, and\\nresting on his two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back still\\nfurther over, at the same time sideways inclining his head, so as to\\nbring his best ear into play.\\n“Cook,” said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his\\nmouth, “don’t you think this steak is rather overdone? You’ve been\\nbeating this steak too much, cook; it’s too tender. Don’t I always say\\nthat to be good, a whale-steak must be tough? There are those\\nsharks now over the side, don’t you see they prefer it tough and\\nrare? What a shindy they are kicking up! Cook, go and talk to ’em;\\ntell ’em they are welcome to help themselves civilly, and in\\nmoderation, but they must keep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my\\nown voice. Away, cook, and deliver my message. Here, take this\\nlantern,” snatching one from his sideboard; “now then, go and\\npreach to ’em!”\\nSullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the\\ndeck to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light\\nlow over the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with\\nthe other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far\\nover the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks,\\nwhile Stubb, softly crawling behind, overheard all that was said.\\n“Fellow-critters: I’se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat\\ndam noise dare. You hear? Stop dat dam smackin’ ob de lip! Massa\\nStubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but\\nby Gor! you must stop dat dam racket!”\\n“Cook,” here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a\\nsudden slap on the shoulder,—“Cook! why, damn your eyes, you\\nmustn’t swear that way when you’re preaching. That’s no way to\\nconvert sinners, cook!”\\n“Who dat? Den preach to him yourself,” sullenly turning to go.\\n“No, cook; go on, go on.”\\n“Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:”—\\n“Right!” exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, “coax ’em to it; try that,”\\nand Fleece continued.\\n“Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to\\nyou, fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness—’top dat dam slappin’ ob\\nde tail! How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam\\nslappin’ and bitin’ dare?”\\n“Cook,” cried Stubb, collaring him, “I won’t have that swearing.\\nTalk to ’em gentlemanly.”\\nOnce more the sermon proceeded.\\n“Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don’t blame ye so much for;\\ndat is natur, and can’t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur,\\ndat is de pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in\\nyou, why den you be angel; for all angel is not’ing more dan de\\nshark well goberned. Now, look here, bred’ren, just try wonst to be\\ncibil, a helping yourselbs from dat whale. Don’t be tearin’ de\\nblubber out your neighbour’s mout, I say. Is not one shark dood\\nright as toder to dat whale? And, by Gor, none on you has de right\\nto dat whale; dat whale belong to some one else. I know some o’\\nyou has berry brig mout, brigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts\\nsometimes has de small bellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is\\nnot to swaller wid, but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob\\nsharks, dat can’t get into de scrouge to help demselves.”\\n“Well done, old Fleece!” cried Stubb, “that’s Christianity; go on.”\\n“No use goin’ on; de dam willains will keep a scougin’ and\\nslappin’ each oder, Massa Stubb; dey don’t hear one word; no use\\na-preachin’ to such dam g’uttons as you call ’em, till dare bellies is\\nfull, and dare bellies is bottomless; and when dey do get ’em full,\\ndey wont hear you den; for den dey sink in de sea, go fast to sleep\\non de coral, and can’t hear not’ing at all, no more, for eber and\\neber.”\\n“Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the\\nbenediction, Fleece, and I’ll away to my supper.”\\nUpon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised\\nhis shrill voice, and cried—\\n“Cussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can;\\nfill your dam’ bellies ’till dey bust—and den die.”\\n“Now, cook,” said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan;\\n“stand just where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay\\nparticular attention.”\\n“All dention,” said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in\\nthe desired position.\\n“Well,” said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; “I shall now\\ngo back to the subject of this steak. In the first place, how old are\\nyou, cook?”\\n“What dat do wid de ’teak,” said the old black, testily.\\n“Silence! How old are you, cook?”\\n“’Bout ninety, dey say,” he gloomily muttered.\\n“And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years,\\ncook, and don’t know yet how to cook a whale-steak?” rapidly\\nbolting another mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a\\ncontinuation of the question. “Where were you born, cook?”\\n“’Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin’ ober de Roanoke.”\\n“Born in a ferry-boat! That’s queer, too. But I want to know what\\ncountry you were born in, cook!”\\n“Didn’t I say de Roanoke country?” he cried sharply.\\n“No, you didn’t, cook; but I’ll tell you what I’m coming to, cook.\\nYou must go home and be born over again; you don’t know how to\\ncook a whale-steak yet.”\\n“Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,” he growled, angrily, turning\\nround to depart.\\n“Come back, cook;—here, hand me those tongs;—now take that\\nbit of steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it\\nshould be? Take it, I say”—holding the tongs towards him—“take it,\\nand taste it.”\\nFaintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old\\nnegro muttered, “Best cooked ’teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.”\\n“Cook,” said Stubb, squaring himself once more; “do you belong\\nto the church?”\\n“Passed one once in Cape-Down,” said the old man sullenly.\\n“And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-\\nTown, where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his\\nhearers as his beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you\\ncome here, and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?”\\nsaid Stubb. “Where do you expect to go to, cook?”\\n“Go to bed berry soon,” he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.\\n“Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It’s an awful\\nquestion. Now what’s your answer?”\\n“When dis old brack man dies,” said the negro slowly, changing\\nhis whole air and demeanor, “he hisself won’t go nowhere; but some\\nbressed angel will come and fetch him.”\\n“Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah? And\\nfetch him where?”\\n“Up dere,” said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head,\\nand keeping it there very solemnly.\\n“So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook,\\nwhen you are dead? But don’t you know the higher you climb, the\\ncolder it gets? Main-top, eh?”\\n“Didn’t say dat t’all,” said Fleece, again in the sulks.\\n“You said up there, didn’t you? and now look yourself, and see\\nwhere your tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into\\nheaven by crawling through the lubber’s hole, cook; but, no, no,\\ncook, you don’t get there, except you go the regular way, round by\\nthe rigging. It’s a ticklish business, but must be done, or else it’s no\\ngo. But none of us are in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and\\nhear my orders. Do ye hear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap\\nt’other a’top of your heart, when I’m giving my orders, cook. What!\\nthat your heart, there?—that’s your gizzard! Aloft! aloft!—that’s it—\\nnow you have it. Hold it there now, and pay attention.”\\n“All ’dention,” said the old black, with both hands placed as\\ndesired, vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in\\nfront at one and the same time.\\n“Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very\\nbad, that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,\\ndon’t you? Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak\\nfor my private table here, the capstan, I’ll tell you what to do so as\\nnot to spoil it by overdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show\\na live coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d’ye hear? And\\nnow to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure you\\nstand by to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for\\nthe ends of the flukes, have them soused, cook. There, now ye may\\ngo.”\\nBut Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.\\n“Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-\\nwatch. D’ye hear? away you sail, then.—Halloa! stop! make a bow\\nbefore you go.—Avast heaving again! Whale-balls for breakfast—\\ndon’t forget.”\\n“Wish, by gor! whale eat him, ’stead of him eat whale. I’m bressed\\nif he ain’t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,” muttered the old\\nman, limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his\\nhammock.\\nCHAPTER 65. The Whale as a\\nDish.\\nThat mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his\\nlamp, and, like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this\\nseems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the\\nhistory and philosophy of it.\\nIt is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right\\nWhale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded\\nlarge prices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth’s time, a certain cook of\\nthe court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable\\nsauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember,\\nare a species of whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered\\nfine eating. The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard\\nballs, and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-\\nballs or veal balls. The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of\\nthem. They had a great porpoise grant from the crown.\\nThe fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by\\nall hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of\\nhim; but when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one\\nhundred feet long, it takes away your appetite. Only the most\\nunprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked\\nwhales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We all know how\\nthey live upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old train\\noil. Zogranda, one of their most famous doctors, recommends strips\\nof blubber for infants, as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing.\\nAnd this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who long ago were\\naccidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel—that these men\\nactually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales\\nwhich had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among the\\nDutch whalemen these scraps are called “fritters”; which, indeed,\\nthey greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling\\nsomething like old Amsterdam housewives’ dough-nuts or oly-\\ncooks, when fresh. They have such an eatable look that the most\\nself-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.\\nBut what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his\\nexceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be\\ndelicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as\\nthe buffalo’s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid\\npyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that\\nis; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the\\nthird month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for\\nbutter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it\\ninto some other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try\\nwatches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip\\ntheir ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there\\nawhile. Many a good supper have I thus made.\\nIn the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a\\nfine dish. The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the\\ntwo plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two\\nlarge puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a\\nmost delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves’ head,\\nwhich is quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows\\nthat some young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining\\nupon calves’ brains, by and by get to have a little brains of their\\nown, so as to be able to tell a calf’s head from their own heads;\\nwhich, indeed, requires uncommon discrimination. And that is the\\nreason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf’s head\\nbefore him, is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see. The\\nhead looks a sort of reproachfully at him, with an “Et tu Brute!”\\nexpression.\\nIt is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively\\nunctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with\\nabhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the\\nconsideration before mentioned: i.e. that a man should eat a newly\\nmurdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light. But no\\ndoubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a\\nmurderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial\\nby oxen, he certainly would have been; and he certainly deserved it\\nif any murderer does. Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night\\nand see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of\\ndead quadrupeds. Does not that sight take a tooth out of the\\ncannibal’s jaw? Cannibals? who is not a cannibal? I tell you it will be\\nmore tolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in\\nhis cellar against a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that\\nprovident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee, civilized\\nand enlightened gourmand, who nailest geese to the ground and\\nfeastest on their bloated livers in thy paté-de-foie-gras.\\nBut Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that\\nis adding insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my\\ncivilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what\\nis that handle made of?—what but the bones of the brother of the\\nvery ox you are eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after\\ndevouring that fat goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with\\nwhat quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of\\nCruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars? It is only within the\\nlast month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize\\nnothing but steel pens.\\nCHAPTER 66. The Shark\\nMassacre.\\nWhen in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after\\nlong and weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a\\ngeneral thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business\\nof cutting him in. For that business is an exceedingly laborious one;\\nis not very soon completed; and requires all hands to set about it.\\nTherefore, the common usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm\\na’lee; and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight,\\nwith the reservation that, until that time, anchor-watches shall be\\nkept; that is, two and two for an hour, each couple, the crew in\\nrotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well.\\nBut sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan\\nwill not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks\\ngather round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours,\\nsay, on a stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by\\nmorning. In most other parts of the ocean, however, where these\\nfish do not so largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at\\ntimes considerably diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with\\nsharp whaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some\\ninstances, only seems to tickle them into still greater activity. But it\\nwas not thus in the present case with the Pequod’s sharks; though,\\nto be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked\\nover her side that night, would have almost thought the whole\\nround sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in\\nit.\\nNevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his\\nsupper was concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a\\nforecastle seaman came on deck, no small excitement was created\\namong the sharks; for immediately suspending the cutting stages\\nover the side, and lowering three lanterns, so that they cast long\\ngleams of light over the turbid sea, these two mariners, darting their\\nlong whaling-spades, kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks,*\\nby striking the keen steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only\\nvital part. But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling\\nhosts, the marksmen could not always hit their mark; and this\\nbrought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe.\\nThey viciously snapped, not only at each other’s disembowelments,\\nbut like flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till those\\nentrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth,\\nto be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was this all. It\\nwas unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these\\ncreatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in\\ntheir very joints and bones, after what might be called the individual\\nlife had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his\\nskin, one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg’s hand off,\\nwhen he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.\\n*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best\\nsteel; is about the bigness of a man’s spread hand; and in general\\nshape, corresponds to the garden implement after which it is\\nnamed; only its sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end\\nconsiderably narrower than the lower. This weapon is always kept as\\nsharp as possible; and when being used is occasionally honed, just\\nlike a razor. In its socket, a stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long,\\nis inserted for a handle.\\n“Queequeg no care what god made him shark,” said the savage,\\nagonizingly lifting his hand up and down; “wedder Fejee god or\\nNantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam\\nIngin.”\\nCHAPTER 67. Cutting In.\\nIt was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio\\nprofessors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod\\nwas turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You\\nwould have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to\\nthe sea gods.\\nIn the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other\\nponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted\\ngreen, and which no single man can possibly lift—this vast bunch of\\ngrapes was swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the\\nlower mast-head, the strongest point anywhere above a ship’s deck.\\nThe end of the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies,\\nwas then conducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block of\\nthe tackles was swung over the whale; to this block the great\\nblubber hook, weighing some one hundred pounds, was attached.\\nAnd now suspended in stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb,\\nthe mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting a hole in\\nthe body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the\\ntwo side-fins. This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the\\nhole, the hook is inserted, and the main body of the crew striking\\nup a wild chorus, now commence heaving in one dense crowd at\\nthe windlass. When instantly, the entire ship careens over on her\\nside; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads of an old house in\\nfrosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her frighted mast-\\nheads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the whale, while\\nevery gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave\\nfrom the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a\\ngreat swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale,\\nand the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the\\ndisengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as the\\nblubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange,\\nso is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is\\nsometimes stripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept\\nup by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over\\nin the water, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off\\nalong the line called the “scarf,” simultaneously cut by the spades of\\nStarbuck and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled\\noff, and indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted\\nhigher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the\\nmen at the windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two\\nthe prodigious blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down\\nfrom the sky, and every one present must take good heed to dodge\\nit when it swings, else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong\\noverboard.\\nOne of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long,\\nkeen weapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he\\ndexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the\\nswaying mass. Into this hole, the end of the second alternating\\ngreat tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber,\\nin order to prepare for what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished\\nswordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a\\nscientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate,\\nlunging slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while the\\nshort lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a blanket-\\npiece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering. The heavers\\nforward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is peeling\\nand hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly\\nslackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main\\nhatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the\\nblubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands\\nkeep coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live\\nmass of plaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two\\ntackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale and\\nwindlass heaving, the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen\\ncoiling, the mates scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands\\nswearing occasionally, by way of assuaging the general friction.\\nCHAPTER 68. The Blanket.\\nI have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the\\nskin of the whale. I have had controversies about it with\\nexperienced whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My\\noriginal opinion remains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.\\nThe question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already\\nyou know what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the\\nconsistence of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic\\nand compact, and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen\\ninches in thickness.\\nNow, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any\\ncreature’s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet\\nin point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption;\\nbecause you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the\\nwhale’s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping\\nlayer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the\\nskin? True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may\\nscrape off with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance,\\nsomewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is\\nalmost as flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried,\\nwhen it not only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard\\nand brittle. I have several such dried bits, which I use for marks in\\nmy whale-books. It is transparent, as I said before; and being laid\\nupon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself with\\nfancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant\\nto read about whales through their own spectacles, as you may say.\\nBut what I am driving at here is this. That same infinitely thin,\\nisinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the entire body of the\\nwhale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature, as\\nthe skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say,\\nthat the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more\\ntender than the skin of a new-born child. But no more of this.\\nAssuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this\\nskin, as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk\\nof one hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in\\nquantity, or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only\\nthree fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea\\nmay hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a\\nmere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as\\nthat. Reckoning ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net\\nweight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale’s skin.\\nIn life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least\\namong the many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over\\nobliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in\\nthick array, something like those in the finest Italian line engravings.\\nBut these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass\\nsubstance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if\\nthey were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some\\ninstances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a\\nveritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations.\\nThese are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers\\non the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word\\nto use in the present connexion. By my retentive memory of the\\nhieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much\\nstruck with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled\\non the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper\\nMississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale\\nremains undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds\\nme of another thing. Besides all the other phenomena which the\\nexterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the\\nback, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the\\nregular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches,\\naltogether of an irregular, random aspect. I should say that those\\nNew England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to\\nbear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating\\nicebergs—I should say, that those rocks must not a little resemble\\nthe Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me that such\\nscratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with\\nother whales; for I have most remarked them in the large, full-grown\\nbulls of the species.\\nA word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber\\nof the whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in\\nlong pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is\\nvery happy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his\\nblubber as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian\\nponcho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason\\nof this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to\\nkeep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and\\ntides. What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those\\nshuddering, icy seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy\\nsurtout? True, other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those\\nHyperborean waters; but these, be it observed, are your cold-\\nblooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies are refrigerators; creatures,\\nthat warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in\\nwinter would bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the whale\\nhas lungs and warm blood. Freeze his blood, and he dies. How\\nwonderful is it then—except after explanation—that this great\\nmonster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to\\nman; how wonderful that he should be found at home, immersed to\\nhis lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall\\noverboard, \\nthey \\nare \\nsometimes \\nfound, \\nmonths \\nafterwards,\\nperpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is\\nfound glued in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has\\nbeen proved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is\\nwarmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer.\\nIt does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong\\nindividual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare\\nvirtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself\\nafter the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou,\\ntoo, live in this world without being of it. Be cool at the equator;\\nkeep thy blood fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter’s,\\nand like the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature\\nof thine own.\\nBut how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of\\nerections, how few are domed like St. Peter’s! of creatures, how few\\nvast as the whale!\\nCHAPTER 69. The Funeral.\\n“Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!”\\nThe vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body\\nof the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though\\nchanged in hue, it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still\\ncolossal. Slowly it floats more and more away, the water round it\\ntorn and splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed\\nwith rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so\\nmany insulting poniards in the whale. The vast white headless\\nphantom floats further and further from the ship, and every rod that\\nit so floats, what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of\\nfowls, augment the murderous din. For hours and hours from the\\nalmost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen. Beneath the\\nunclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the pleasant\\nsea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of death floats\\non and on, till lost in infinite perspectives.\\nThere’s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-\\nvultures all in pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in\\nblack or speckled. In life but few of them would have helped the\\nwhale, I ween, if peradventure he had needed it; but upon the\\nbanquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce. Oh, horrible\\nvultureism of earth! from which not the mightiest whale is free.\\nNor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost\\nsurvives and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-\\nwar or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance\\nobscuring the swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white\\nmass floating in the sun, and the white spray heaving high against\\nit; straightway the whale’s unharming corpse, with trembling fingers\\nis set down in the log—shoals, rocks, and breakers hereabouts:\\nbeware! And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place;\\nleaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because their\\nleader originally leaped there when a stick was held. There’s your\\nlaw of precedents; there’s your utility of traditions; there’s the story\\nof your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the\\nearth, and now not even hovering in the air! There’s orthodoxy!\\nThus, while in life the great whale’s body may have been a real\\nterror to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic\\nto a world.\\nAre you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts\\nthan the Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson\\nwho believe in them.\\nCHAPTER 70. The Sphynx.\\nIt should not have been omitted that previous to completely\\nstripping the body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the\\nbeheading of the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon\\nwhich experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves: and\\nnot without reason.\\nConsider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a\\nneck; on the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there,\\nin that very place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that\\nthe surgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet\\nintervening between him and his subject, and that subject almost\\nhidden in a discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and\\nbursting sea. Bear in mind, too, that under these untoward\\ncircumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh; and in that\\nsubterraneous manner, without so much as getting one single peep\\ninto the ever-contracting gash thus made, he must skilfully steer\\nclear of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine\\nat a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull. Do you not\\nmarvel, then, at Stubb’s boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to\\nbehead a sperm whale?\\nWhen first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by\\na cable till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small\\nwhale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with\\na full grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale’s head\\nembraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to\\nsuspend such a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a\\nwhaler, this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch\\nbarn in jewellers’ scales.\\nThe Pequod’s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the\\nhead was hoisted against the ship’s side—about half way out of the\\nsea, so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native\\nelement. And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it,\\nby reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-\\nhead, and every yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over\\nthe waves; there, that blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod’s\\nwaist like the giant Holofernes’s from the girdle of Judith.\\nWhen this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the\\nseamen went below to their dinner. Silence reigned over the before\\ntumultuous but now deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a\\nuniversal yellow lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless\\nmeasureless leaves upon the sea.\\nA short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab\\nalone from his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he\\npaused to gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-\\nchains he took Stubb’s long spade—still remaining there after the\\nwhale’s decapitation—and striking it into the lower part of the half-\\nsuspended mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm,\\nand so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.\\nIt was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst\\nof so intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx’s in the desert. “Speak,\\nthou vast and venerable head,” muttered Ahab, “which, though\\nungarnished with a beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with\\nmosses; speak, mighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in\\nthee. Of all divers, thou hast dived the deepest. That head upon\\nwhich the upper sun now gleams, has moved amid this world’s\\nfoundations. Where unrecorded names and navies rust, and untold\\nhopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold this frigate\\nearth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there, in\\nthat awful water-land, there was thy most familiar home. Thou hast\\nbeen where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many a sailor’s\\nside, where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them\\ndown. Thou saw’st the locked lovers when leaping from their\\nflaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave;\\ntrue to each other, when heaven seemed false to them. Thou saw’st\\nthe murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck;\\nfor hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw; and\\nhis murderers still sailed on unharmed—while swift lightnings\\nshivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous\\nhusband to outstretched, longing arms. O head! thou hast seen\\nenough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and\\nnot one syllable is thine!”\\n“Sail ho!” cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.\\n“Aye? Well, now, that’s cheering,” cried Ahab, suddenly erecting\\nhimself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow.\\n“That lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better\\nman.—Where away?”\\n“Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her\\nbreeze to us!\\n“Better and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come along\\nthat way, and to my breezelessness bring his breeze! O Nature, and\\nO soul of man! how far beyond all utterance are your linked\\nanalogies! not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its\\ncunning duplicate in mind.”\\nCHAPTER 71. The Jeroboam’s\\nStory.\\nHand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came\\nfaster than the ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.\\nBy and by, through the glass the stranger’s boats and manned\\nmast-heads proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to\\nwindward, and shooting by, apparently making a passage to some\\nother ground, the Pequod could not hope to reach her. So the\\nsignal was set to see what response would be made.\\nHere be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships\\nof the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which\\nsignals being collected in a book with the names of the respective\\nvessels attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the\\nwhale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the\\nocean, even at considerable distances and with no small facility.\\nThe Pequod’s signal was at last responded to by the stranger’s\\nsetting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of\\nNantucket. Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under\\nthe Pequod’s lee, and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the\\nside-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck’s order to accommodate\\nthe visiting captain, the stranger in question waved his hand from\\nhis boat’s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely\\nunnecessary. It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant\\nepidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of\\ninfecting the Pequod’s company. For, though himself and boat’s crew\\nremained untainted, and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off,\\nand an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between; yet\\nconscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he\\nperemptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod.\\nBut this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving\\nan interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the\\nJeroboam’s boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep\\nparallel to the Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by\\nthis time it blew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though,\\nindeed, at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the\\nboat would be pushed some way ahead; but would be soon skilfully\\nbrought to her proper bearings again. Subject to this, and other the\\nlike interruptions now and then, a conversation was sustained\\nbetween the two parties; but at intervals not without still another\\ninterruption of a very different sort.\\nPulling an oar in the Jeroboam’s boat, was a man of a singular\\nappearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual\\nnotabilities make up all totalities. He was a small, short, youngish\\nman, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant\\nyellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut\\ntinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled\\nup on his wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.\\nSo soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had\\nexclaimed—“That’s he! that’s he!—the long-togged scaramouch the\\nTown-Ho’s company told us of!” Stubb here alluded to a strange\\nstory told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew,\\nsome time previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho.\\nAccording to this account and what was subsequently learned, it\\nseemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful\\nascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam. His story was\\nthis:\\nHe had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of\\nNeskyeuna Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their\\ncracked, secret meetings having several times descended from\\nheaven by the way of a trap-door, announcing the speedy opening\\nof the seventh vial, which he carried in his vest-pocket; but, which,\\ninstead of containing gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with\\nlaudanum. A strange, apostolic whim having seized him, he had left\\nNeskyeuna for Nantucket, where, with that cunning peculiar to\\ncraziness, he assumed a steady, common-sense exterior, and offered\\nhimself as a green-hand candidate for the Jeroboam’s whaling\\nvoyage. They engaged him; but straightway upon the ship’s getting\\nout of sight of land, his insanity broke out in a freshet. He\\nannounced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded the\\ncaptain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he\\nset himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar-\\ngeneral of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which he\\ndeclared these things;—the dark, daring play of his sleepless,\\nexcited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium,\\nunited to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the\\nignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they\\nwere afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much\\npractical use in the ship, especially as he refused to work except\\nwhen he pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid\\nof him; but apprised that that individual’s intention was to land him\\nin the first convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his\\nseals and vials—devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional\\nperdition, in case this intention was carried out. So strongly did he\\nwork upon his disciples among the crew, that at last in a body they\\nwent to the captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship,\\nnot a man of them would remain. He was therefore forced to\\nrelinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any way\\nmaltreated, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass that\\nGabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of\\nall this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain\\nand mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a\\nhigher hand than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it,\\nwas at his sole command; nor should it be stayed but according to\\nhis good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and\\nsome of them fawned before him; in obedience to his instructions,\\nsometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god. Such\\nthings may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true.\\nNor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the\\nmeasureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless\\npower of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to\\nreturn to the Pequod.\\n“I fear not thy epidemic, man,” said Ahab from the bulwarks, to\\nCaptain Mayhew, who stood in the boat’s stern; “come on board.”\\nBut now Gabriel started to his feet.\\n“Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the\\nhorrible plague!”\\n“Gabriel! Gabriel!” cried Captain Mayhew; “thou must either—” But\\nthat instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its\\nseethings drowned all speech.\\n“Hast thou seen the White Whale?” demanded Ahab, when the\\nboat drifted back.\\n“Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the\\nhorrible tail!”\\n“I tell thee again, Gabriel, that—” But again the boat tore ahead\\nas if dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while\\na succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those\\noccasional caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it.\\nMeantime, the hoisted sperm whale’s head jogged about very\\nviolently, and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more\\napprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant.\\nWhen this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story\\nconcerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions\\nfrom Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea\\nthat seemed leagued with him.\\nIt seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon\\nspeaking a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the\\nexistence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily\\nsucking in this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain\\nagainst attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be\\nseen; in his gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be\\nno less a being than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers\\nreceiving the Bible. But when, some year or two afterwards, Moby\\nDick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate,\\nburned with ardour to encounter him; and the captain himself being\\nnot unwilling to let him have the opportunity, despite all the\\narchangel’s denunciations and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in\\npersuading five men to man his boat. With them he pushed off;\\nand, after much weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful\\nonsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast. Meantime,\\nGabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one\\narm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of speedy\\ndoom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while Macey,\\nthe mate, was standing up in his boat’s bow, and with all the\\nreckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon\\nthe whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo!\\na broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning\\nmotion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the\\noarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was\\nsmitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell\\ninto the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the\\nboat was harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman’s head; but the mate\\nfor ever sank.\\nIt is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the\\nSperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.\\nSometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;\\noftener the boat’s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which\\nthe headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the\\nbody. But strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances\\nthan one, when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of\\nviolence is discernible; the man being stark dead.\\nThe whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly\\ndescried from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek—“The vial! the\\nvial!” Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further\\nhunting of the whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with\\nadded influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he\\nhad specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general\\nprophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to\\nhit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a\\nnameless terror to the ship.\\nMayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions\\nto him, that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring\\nwhether he intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should\\noffer. To which Ahab answered—“Aye.” Straightway, then, Gabriel\\nonce more started to his feet, glaring upon the old man, and\\nvehemently exclaimed, with downward pointed finger—“Think, think\\nof the blasphemer—dead, and down there!—beware of the\\nblasphemer’s end!”\\nAhab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, “Captain, I have\\njust bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy\\nofficers, if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.”\\nEvery whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various\\nships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be\\naddressed, depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in\\nthe four oceans. Thus, most letters never reach their mark; and\\nmany are only received after attaining an age of two or three years\\nor more.\\nSoon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely\\ntumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in\\nconsequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a\\nletter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.\\n“Can’st not read it?” cried Ahab. “Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it’s but\\na dim scrawl;—what’s this?” As he was studying it out, Starbuck took\\na long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end,\\nto insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat,\\nwithout its coming any closer to the ship.\\nMeantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, “Mr. Har—yes, Mr.\\nHarry—(a woman’s pinny hand,—the man’s wife, I’ll wager)—Aye—\\nMr. Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;—why it’s Macey, and he’s dead!”\\n“Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,” sighed Mayhew; “but\\nlet me have it.”\\n“Nay, keep it thyself,” cried Gabriel to Ahab; “thou art soon going\\nthat way.”\\n“Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew, stand by\\nnow to receive it”; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck’s\\nhands, he caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over\\ntowards the boat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly\\ndesisted from rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the ship’s\\nstern; so that, as if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with\\nGabriel’s eager hand. He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-\\nknife, and impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the\\nship. It fell at Ahab’s feet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades\\nto give way with their oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat\\nrapidly shot away from the Pequod.\\nAs, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the\\njacket of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to\\nthis wild affair.\\nCHAPTER 72. The Monkey-\\nRope.\\nIn the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,\\nthere is much running backwards and forwards among the crew.\\nNow hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted\\nthere. There is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same\\ntime everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same\\nwith him who endeavors the description of the scene. We must now\\nretrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking\\nground in the whale’s back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the\\noriginal hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But how did so\\nclumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that\\nhole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose\\nduty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster’s back for\\nthe special purpose referred to. But in very many cases,\\ncircumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the\\nwhale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded.\\nThe whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting\\nthe immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet\\nbelow the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about,\\nhalf on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves\\nlike a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question,\\nQueequeg figured in the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in\\nwhich to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage;\\nand no one had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be\\nseen.\\nBeing the savage’s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the\\nbow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my\\ncheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble\\nscramble upon the dead whale’s back. You have seen Italian organ-\\nboys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord. Just so, from the ship’s\\nsteep side, did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is\\ntechnically called in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong\\nstrip of canvas belted round his waist.\\nIt was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before\\nwe proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast\\nat both ends; fast to Queequeg’s broad canvas belt, and fast to my\\nnarrow leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the\\ntime, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no\\nmore, then both usage and honor demanded, that instead of\\ncutting the cord, it should drag me down in his wake. So, then, an\\nelongated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my own\\ninseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get rid of the\\ndangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.\\nSo strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation\\nthen, that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly\\nto perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint\\nstock company of two; that my free will had received a mortal\\nwound; and that another’s mistake or misfortune might plunge\\ninnocent me into unmerited disaster and death. Therefore, I saw\\nthat here was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for its even-\\nhanded equity never could have so gross an injustice. And yet still\\nfurther pondering—while I jerked him now and then from between\\nthe whale and ship, which would threaten to jam him—still further\\npondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise\\nsituation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one\\nway or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other\\nmortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by\\nmistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say\\nthat, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the\\nmultitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg’s\\nmonkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I\\ncame very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that,\\ndo what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*\\n*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the\\nPequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together.\\nThis improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no\\nless a man than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer\\nthe strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance\\nof his monkey-rope holder.\\nI have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from\\nbetween the whale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall,\\nfrom the incessant rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the\\nonly jamming jeopardy he was exposed to. Unappalled by the\\nmassacre made upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly\\nand more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to\\nflow from the carcass—the rabid creatures swarmed round it like\\nbees in a beehive.\\nAnd right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often\\npushed them aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether\\nincredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale,\\nthe otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a\\nman.\\nNevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a\\nravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to\\nthem. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and\\nthen jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of\\nwhat seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still\\nanother protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages,\\nTashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple\\nof keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks\\nas they could reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very\\ndisinterested and benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg’s best\\nhappiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from\\nthe circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half\\nhidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of\\ntheirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail. But poor\\nQueequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that great\\niron hook—poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and\\ngave up his life into the hands of his gods.\\nWell, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew\\nin and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what\\nmatters it, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all\\nof us men in this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp\\nin, is Life; those sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and\\nwhat between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril,\\npoor lad.\\nBut courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For\\nnow, as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at\\nlast climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily\\ntrembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a\\nbenevolent, consolatory glance hands him—what? Some hot\\nCognac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger\\nand water!\\n“Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming\\nnear. “Yes, this must be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup.\\nThen standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked\\ntowards the astonished steward slowly saying, “Ginger? ginger? and\\nwill you have the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies\\nthe virtue of ginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use,\\nDough-boy, to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!—what\\nthe devil is ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer matches?—tinder?\\n—gunpowder?—what the devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this\\ncup to our poor Queequeg here.”\\n“There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about\\nthis business,” he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who\\nhad just come from forward. “Will you look at that kannakin, sir:\\nsmell of it, if you please.” Then watching the mate’s countenance, he\\nadded, “The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that\\ncalomel and jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is\\nthe steward an apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the\\nsort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned\\nman?”\\n“I trust not,” said Starbuck, “it is poor stuff enough.”\\n“Aye, aye, steward,” cried Stubb, “we’ll teach you to drug a\\nharpooneer; none of your apothecary’s medicine here; you want to\\npoison us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and\\nwant to murder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?”\\n“It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy, “it was Aunt Charity that\\nbrought the ginger on board; and bade me never give the\\nharpooneers any spirits, but only this ginger-jub—so she called it.”\\n“Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye\\nto the lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr.\\nStarbuck. It is the captain’s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a\\nwhale.”\\n“Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don’t hit him again, but—”\\n“Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or\\nsomething of that sort; and this fellow’s a weazel. What were you\\nabout saying, sir?”\\n“Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”\\nWhen Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand,\\nand a sort of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong\\nspirits, and was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity’s\\ngift, and that was freely given to the waves.\\nCHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask\\nkill a Right Whale; and Then\\nHave a Talk over Him.\\nIt must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm\\nWhale’s prodigious head hanging to the Pequod’s side. But we must\\nlet it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to\\nattend to it. For the present other matters press, and the best we\\ncan do now for the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.\\nNow, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had\\ngradually drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of\\nyellow brit, gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a\\nspecies of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this\\nparticular time lurking anywhere near. And though all hands\\ncommonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures; and\\nthough the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all,\\nand though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts\\nwithout lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been\\nbrought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the\\nannouncement was made that a Right Whale should be captured\\nthat day, if opportunity offered.\\nNor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and\\ntwo boats, Stubb’s and Flask’s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling\\nfurther and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the\\nmen at the mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a\\ngreat heap of tumultuous white water, and soon after news came\\nfrom aloft that one or both the boats must be fast. An interval\\npassed and the boats were in plain sight, in the act of being\\ndragged right towards the ship by the towing whale. So close did\\nthe monster come to the hull, that at first it seemed as if he meant\\nit malice; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom, within three\\nrods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from view, as if diving\\nunder the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the ship to the boats,\\nwhich, for one instant, seemed on the point of being brought with a\\ndeadly dash against the vessel’s side. But having plenty of line yet in\\nthe tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they paid out\\nabundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their might\\nso as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle was\\nintensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened line in\\none direction, and still plied their oars in another, the contending\\nstrain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few feet\\nadvance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did gain\\nit; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along\\nthe keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly\\nrose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so\\nflinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken glass\\non the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once\\nmore the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his\\nspeed, and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the\\nship towing the two boats after him, so that they performed a\\ncomplete circuit.\\nMeantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close\\nflanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for\\nlance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while\\nthe multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm\\nWhale’s body, rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily\\ndrinking at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new\\nbursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock.\\nAt last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he\\nturned upon his back a corpse.\\nWhile the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to\\nhis flukes, and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for\\ntowing, some conversation ensued between them.\\n“I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,”\\nsaid Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to\\ndo with so ignoble a leviathan.\\n“Wants with it?” said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat’s\\nbow, “did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm\\nWhale’s head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a\\nRight Whale’s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that\\nship can never afterwards capsize?”\\n“Why not?\\n“I don’t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah\\nsaying so, and he seems to know all about ships’ charms. But I\\nsometimes think he’ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don’t half\\nlike that chap, Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a\\nsort of carved into a snake’s head, Stubb?”\\n“Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a\\ndark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by;\\nlook down there, Flask”—pointing into the sea with a peculiar\\nmotion of both hands—“Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be\\nthe devil in disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about\\nhis having been stowed away on board ship? He’s the devil, I say.\\nThe reason why you don’t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out\\nof sight; he carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him!\\nnow that I think of it, he’s always wanting oakum to stuff into the\\ntoes of his boots.”\\n“He sleeps in his boots, don’t he? He hasn’t got any hammock;\\nbut I’ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.”\\n“No doubt, and it’s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do\\nye see, in the eye of the rigging.”\\n“What’s the old man have so much to do with him for?”\\n“Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.”\\n“Bargain?—about what?”\\n“Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale,\\nand the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to\\nswap away his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort,\\nand then he’ll surrender Moby Dick.”\\n“Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”\\n“I don’t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked\\none, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the\\nold flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and\\ngentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well,\\nhe was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil,\\nswitching his hoofs, up and says, ‘I want John.’ ‘What for?’ says the\\nold governor. ‘What business is that of yours,’ says the devil, getting\\nmad,—‘I want to use him.’ ‘Take him,’ says the governor—and by the\\nLord, Flask, if the devil didn’t give John the Asiatic cholera before he\\ngot through with him, I’ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look\\nsharp—ain’t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let’s get\\nthe whale alongside.”\\n“I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said\\nFlask, when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their\\nburden towards the ship, “but I can’t remember where.”\\n“Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded\\nsoldadoes? Did ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?”\\n“No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me,\\nStubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now,\\nwas the same you say is now on board the Pequod?”\\n“Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn’t the devil\\nlive for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever\\nsee any parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil\\nhas a latch-key to get into the admiral’s cabin, don’t you suppose\\nhe can crawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?”\\n“How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?”\\n“Do you see that mainmast there?” pointing to the ship; “well,\\nthat’s the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod’s hold,\\nand string along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see;\\nwell, that wouldn’t begin to be Fedallah’s age. Nor all the coopers in\\ncreation couldn’t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.”\\n“But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that\\nyou meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance.\\nNow, if he’s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is\\ngoing to live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard—\\ntell me that?\\n“Give him a good ducking, anyhow.”\\n“But he’d crawl back.”\\n“Duck him again; and keep ducking him.”\\n“Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though—\\nyes, and drown you—what then?”\\n“I should like to see him try it; I’d give him such a pair of black\\neyes that he wouldn’t dare to show his face in the admiral’s cabin\\nagain for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he\\nlives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much.\\nDamn the devil, Flask; so you suppose I’m afraid of the devil? Who’s\\nafraid of him, except the old governor who daresn’t catch him and\\nput him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about\\nkidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the\\npeople the devil kidnapped, he’d roast for him? There’s a governor!”\\n“Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?”\\n“Do I suppose it? You’ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going\\nnow to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very\\nsuspicious going on, I’ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and\\nsay—Look here, Beelzebub, you don’t do it; and if he makes any\\nfuss, by the Lord I’ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it\\nto the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his\\ntail will come short off at the stump—do you see; and then, I rather\\nguess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he’ll\\nsneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his\\nlegs.”\\n“And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?”\\n“Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;—what\\nelse?”\\n“Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along,\\nStubb?”\\n“Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.”\\nThe boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard\\nside, where fluke chains and other necessaries were already\\nprepared for securing him.\\n“Didn’t I tell you so?” said Flask; “yes, you’ll soon see this right\\nwhale’s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti’s.”\\nIn good time, Flask’s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod\\nsteeply leaned over towards the sperm whale’s head, now, by the\\ncounterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though\\nsorely strained, you may well believe. So, when on one side you\\nhoist in Locke’s head, you go over that way; but now, on the other\\nside, hoist in Kant’s and you come back again; but in very poor\\nplight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye\\nfoolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard, and then you will\\nfloat light and right.\\nIn disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought\\nalongside the ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly\\ntake place as in the case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter\\ninstance, the head is cut off whole, but in the former the lips and\\ntongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck, with all the\\nwell known black bone attached to what is called the crown-piece.\\nBut nothing like this, in the present case, had been done. The\\ncarcases of both whales had dropped astern; and the head-laden\\nship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening\\npanniers.\\nMeantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale’s head, and\\never and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in\\nhis own hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee\\noccupied his shadow; while, if the Parsee’s shadow was there at all it\\nseemed only to blend with, and lengthen Ahab’s. As the crew toiled\\non, Laplandish speculations were bandied among them, concerning\\nall these passing things.\\nCHAPTER 74. The Sperm\\nWhale’s Head—Contrasted\\nView.\\nHere, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let\\nus join them, and lay together our own.\\nOf the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the\\nRight Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only\\nwhales regularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present\\nthe two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale. As the\\nexternal difference between them is mainly observable in their\\nheads; and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the\\nPequod’s side; and as we may freely go from one to the other, by\\nmerely stepping across the deck:—where, I should like to know, will\\nyou obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here?\\nIn the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\\nthese heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is\\na certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the\\nRight Whale’s sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm\\nWhale’s head. As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense\\nsuperiority to him, in point of pervading dignity. In the present\\ninstance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt\\ncolour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and\\nlarge experience. In short, he is what the fishermen technically call a\\n“grey-headed whale.”\\nLet us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely,\\nthe two most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on\\nthe side of the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale’s\\njaw, if you narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which\\nyou would fancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is\\nit to the magnitude of the head.\\nNow, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is\\nplain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no\\nmore than he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the\\nwhale’s eyes corresponds to that of a man’s ears; and you may\\nfancy, for yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways\\nsurvey objects through your ears. You would find that you could\\nonly command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the\\nstraight side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it. If your\\nbitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted\\nin broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more than if\\nhe were stealing upon you from behind. In a word, you would have\\ntwo backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side\\nfronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man—what, indeed,\\nbut his eyes?\\nMoreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the\\neyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so\\nas to produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar\\nposition of the whale’s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many\\ncubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a great\\nmountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must\\nwholly separate the impressions which each independent organ\\nimparts. The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this\\nside, and another distinct picture on that side; while all between\\nmust be profound darkness and nothingness to him. Man may, in\\neffect, be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two\\njoined sashes for his window. But with the whale, these two sashes\\nare separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly\\nimpairing the view. This peculiarity of the whale’s eyes is a thing\\nalways to be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered\\nby the reader in some subsequent scenes.\\nA curious and most puzzling question might be started\\nconcerning this visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must\\nbe content with a hint. So long as a man’s eyes are open in the\\nlight, the act of seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help\\nmechanically seeing whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless,\\nany one’s experience will teach him, that though he can take in an\\nundiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite\\nimpossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two\\nthings—however large or however small—at one and the same\\ninstant of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each\\nother. But if you now come to separate these two objects, and\\nsurround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to\\nsee one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear\\non it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary\\nconsciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes,\\nin themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much\\nmore comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can\\nat the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct\\nprospects, one on one side of him, and the other in an exactly\\nopposite direction? If he can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him,\\nas if a man were able simultaneously to go through the\\ndemonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid. Nor, strictly\\ninvestigated, is there any incongruity in this comparison.\\nIt may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that\\nthe extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some\\nwhales when beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability\\nto queer frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this\\nindirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which\\ntheir divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must\\ninvolve them.\\nBut the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an\\nentire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads\\nfor hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external\\nleaf whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill,\\nso wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With\\nrespect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed\\nbetween the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former\\nhas an external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly\\ncovered over with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible\\nfrom without.\\nIs it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the\\nworld through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear\\nwhich is smaller than a hare’s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens\\nof Herschel’s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches\\nof cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper\\nof hearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try to “enlarge” your\\nmind? Subtilize it.\\nLet us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at\\nhand, cant over the sperm whale’s head, that it may lie bottom up;\\nthen, ascending by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the\\nmouth; and were it not that the body is now completely separated\\nfrom it, with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky\\nMammoth Cave of his stomach. But let us hold on here by this\\ntooth, and look about us where we are. What a really beautiful and\\nchaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered\\nwith a glistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.\\nBut come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which\\nseems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the\\nhinge at one end, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get\\nit overhead, and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific\\nportcullis; and such, alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the\\nfishery, upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force. But far\\nmore terrible is it to behold, when fathoms down in the sea, you\\nsee some sulky whale, floating there suspended, with his prodigious\\njaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging straight down at right-angles\\nwith his body, for all the world like a ship’s jib-boom. This whale is\\nnot dead; he is only dispirited; out of sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac;\\nand so supine, that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed, leaving him\\nthere in that ungainly sort of plight, a reproach to all his tribe, who\\nmust, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon him.\\nIn most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a\\npractised artist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose\\nof extracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard\\nwhite whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of\\ncurious articles, including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to\\nriding-whips.\\nWith a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were\\nan anchor; and when the proper time comes—some few days after\\nthe other work—Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all\\naccomplished dentists, are set to drawing teeth. With a keen\\ncutting-spade, Queequeg lances the gums; then the jaw is lashed\\ndown to ringbolts, and a tackle being rigged from aloft, they drag\\nout these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of\\nwild wood lands. There are generally forty-two teeth in all; in old\\nwhales, much worn down, but undecayed; nor filled after our\\nartificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs, and piled\\naway like joists for building houses.\\nCHAPTER 75. The Right\\nWhale’s Head—Contrasted\\nView.\\nCrossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right\\nWhale’s head.\\nAs in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’s head may be\\ncompared to a Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so\\nbroadly rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale’s head bears\\na rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two\\nhundred years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of\\na shoemaker’s last. And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of\\nthe nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably\\nbe lodged, she and all her progeny.\\nBut as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume\\ndifferent aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its\\nsummit and look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take\\nthe whole head for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the\\napertures in its sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye\\nupon this strange, crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the\\nmass—this green, barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the\\n“crown,” and the Southern fishers the “bonnet” of the Right Whale;\\nfixing your eyes solely on this, you would take the head for the\\ntrunk of some huge oak, with a bird’s nest in its crotch. At any rate,\\nwhen you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet,\\nsuch an idea will be almost sure to occur to you; unless, indeed,\\nyour fancy has been fixed by the technical term “crown” also\\nbestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in\\nthinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the\\nsea, whose green crown has been put together for him in this\\nmarvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky\\nlooking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower lip!\\nwhat a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter’s\\nmeasurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and\\npout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.\\nA great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-\\nlipped. The fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother\\nduring an important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast,\\nwhen earthquakes caused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a\\nslippery threshold, we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word\\nwere I at Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian\\nwigwam. Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is\\nabout twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there\\nwere a regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy\\nsides, present us with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped\\nslats of whalebone, say three hundred on a side, which depending\\nfrom the upper part of the head or crown bone, form those\\nVenetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned. The\\nedges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which\\nthe Right Whale strains the water, and in whose intricacies he\\nretains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes through the seas\\nof brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of bone, as they stand\\nin their natural order, there are certain curious marks, curves,\\nhollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the\\ncreature’s age, as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the\\ncertainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the\\nsavor of analogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we must\\ngrant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will\\nseem reasonable.\\nIn old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious\\nfancies concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them\\nthe wondrous “whiskers” inside of the whale’s mouth;* another,\\n“hogs’ bristles”; a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following\\nelegant language: “There are about two hundred and fifty fins\\ngrowing on each side of his upper chop, which arch over his tongue\\non each side of his mouth.”\\n*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker,\\nor rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on\\nthe upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these\\ntufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn\\ncountenance.\\nAs every one knows, these same “hogs’ bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,”\\n“blinds,” or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks\\nand other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand\\nhas long been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne’s time that the\\nbone was in its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And\\nas those ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of\\nthe whale, as you may say; even so, in a shower, with the like\\nthoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for\\nprotection; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone.\\nBut now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,\\nstanding in the Right Whale’s mouth, look around you afresh.\\nSeeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about,\\nwould you not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ,\\nand gazing upon its thousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we\\nhave a rug of the softest Turkey—the tongue, which is glued, as it\\nwere, to the floor of the mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to\\ntear in pieces in hoisting it on deck. This particular tongue now\\nbefore us; at a passing glance I should say it was a six-barreler; that\\nis, it will yield you about that amount of oil.\\nEre this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started\\nwith—that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost\\nentirely different heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale’s there\\nis no great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender\\nmandible of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale’s. Nor in the Sperm\\nWhale are there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and\\nscarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two\\nexternal spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.\\nLook your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they\\nyet lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the\\nother will not be very long in following.\\nCan you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale’s there? It is\\nthe same he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the\\nforehead seem now faded away. I think his broad brow to be full of\\na prairie-like placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death.\\nBut mark the other head’s expression. See that amazing lower lip,\\npressed by accident against the vessel’s side, so as firmly to\\nembrace the jaw. Does not this whole head seem to speak of an\\nenormous practical resolution in facing death? This Right Whale I\\ntake to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might\\nhave taken up Spinoza in his latter years.\\nCHAPTER 76. The Battering-\\nRam.\\nEre quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale’s head, I would have\\nyou, as a sensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front\\naspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you\\ninvestigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some\\nunexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram\\npower may be lodged there. Here is a vital point; for you must\\neither satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever\\nremain an infidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less\\ntrue events, perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.\\nYou observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm\\nWhale, the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical\\nplane to the water; you observe that the lower part of that front\\nslopes considerably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for\\nthe long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you\\nobserve that the mouth is entirely under the head, much in the\\nsame way, indeed, as though your own mouth were entirely under\\nyour chin. Moreover you observe that the whale has no external\\nnose; and that what nose he has—his spout hole—is on the top of\\nhis head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his\\nhead, nearly one third of his entire length from the front. Wherefore,\\nyou must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale’s\\nhead is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender\\nprominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to\\nconsider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part of\\nthe front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and not\\ntill you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the\\nfull cranial development. So that this whole enormous boneless\\nmass is as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its\\ncontents partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to\\nbe apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably\\ninvests all that apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have\\ndescribed to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale, as\\nthe rind wraps an orange. Just so with the head; but with this\\ndifference: about the head this envelope, though not so thick, is of\\na boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not handled\\nit. The severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by the\\nstrongest human arm, impotently rebounds from it. It is as though\\nthe forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses’ hoofs. I\\ndo not think that any sensation lurks in it.\\nBethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded\\nIndiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the\\ndocks, what do the sailors do? They do not suspend between them,\\nat the point of coming contact, any merely hard substance, like iron\\nor wood. No, they hold there a large, round wad of tow and cork,\\nenveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide. That bravely and\\nuninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken\\nhandspikes and iron crow-bars. By itself this sufficiently illustrates\\nthe obvious fact I drive at. But supplementary to this, it has\\nhypothetically occurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess what is\\ncalled a swimming bladder in them, capable, at will, of distension or\\ncontraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know, has no such\\nprovision in him; considering, too, the otherwise inexplicable\\nmanner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the\\nsurface, and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water;\\nconsidering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope; considering\\nthe unique interior of his head; it has hypothetically occurred to me,\\nI say, that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs there may\\npossibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion\\nwith the outer air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension\\nand contraction. If this be so, fancy the irresistibleness of that might,\\nto which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements\\ncontributes.\\nNow, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable,\\nuninjurable wall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims\\nbehind it all a mass of tremendous life, only to be adequately\\nestimated as piled wood is—by the cord; and all obedient to one\\nvolition, as the smallest insect. So that when I shall hereafter detail\\nto you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere\\nlurking in this expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his\\nmore inconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced\\nall ignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though\\nthe Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien,\\nand mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one\\nhair of your eye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are but a\\nprovincial and sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing for\\nsalamander giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the\\nprovincials then? What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread\\ngoddess’s veil at Lais?\\nCHAPTER 77. The Great\\nHeidelburgh Tun.\\nNow comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright,\\nyou must know something of the curious internal structure of the\\nthing operated upon.\\nRegarding the Sperm Whale’s head as a solid oblong, you may, on\\nan inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the\\nlower is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the\\nupper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward\\nend forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale.\\nAt the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper\\nquoin, and then you have two almost equal parts, which before\\nwere naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous\\nsubstance.\\n*Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical\\nmathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is\\na solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed\\nby the steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering\\nof both sides.\\nThe lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense\\nhoneycomb of oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten\\nthousand infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its\\nwhole extent. The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded\\nas the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that\\nfamous great tierce is mystically carved in front, so the whale’s vast\\nplaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the\\nemblematical adornment of his wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of\\nHeidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the\\nwines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale contains by far\\nthe most precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the highly-prized\\nspermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous state. Nor\\nis this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the\\ncreature. Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure\\nto the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending forth\\nbeautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate ice is just\\nforming in water. A large whale’s case generally yields about five\\nhundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable circumstances,\\nconsiderable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles away, or is otherwise\\nirrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can.\\nI know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun\\nwas coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not\\npossibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane,\\nlike the lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the\\nSperm Whale’s case.\\nIt will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm\\nWhale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and\\nsince—as has been elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one\\nthird of the whole length of the creature, then setting that length\\ndown at eighty feet for a good sized whale, you have more than\\ntwenty-six feet for the depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise\\nhoisted up and down against a ship’s side.\\nAs in decapitating the whale, the operator’s instrument is brought\\nclose to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the\\nspermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful,\\nlest a careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and\\nwastingly let out its invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of\\nthe head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water, and\\nretained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose\\nhempen combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of\\nropes in that quarter.\\nThus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous\\nand—in this particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby the\\nSperm Whale’s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.\\nCHAPTER 78. Cistern and\\nBuckets.\\nNimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his\\nerect posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-\\narm, to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He\\nhas carried with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only\\ntwo parts, travelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this\\nblock, so that it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end\\nof the rope, till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then,\\nhand-over-hand, down the other part, the Indian drops through the\\nair, till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head. There—still\\nhigh elevated above the rest of the company, to whom he\\nvivaciously cries—he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good\\npeople to prayers from the top of a tower. A short-handled sharp\\nspade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for the proper\\nplace to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business he proceeds\\nvery heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house, sounding\\nthe walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time this\\ncautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a\\nwell-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the\\nother end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or\\nthree alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of\\nthe Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long\\npole. Inserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides\\nthe bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the\\nword to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all\\nbubbling like a dairy-maid’s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from\\nits height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand,\\nand quickly emptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it\\nagain goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield\\nno more. Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder\\nand harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun, until some twenty\\nfeet of the pole have gone down.\\nNow, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in\\nthis way; several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when\\nall at once a queer accident happened. Whether it was that\\nTashtego, that wild Indian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go\\nfor a moment his one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles\\nsuspending the head; or whether the place where he stood was so\\ntreacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil One himself would have it\\nto fall out so, without stating his particular reasons; how it was\\nexactly, there is no telling now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or\\nninetieth bucket came suckingly up—my God! poor Tashtego—like\\nthe twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well, dropped head-\\nforemost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with a\\nhorrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!\\n“Man overboard!” cried Daggoo, who amid the general\\nconsternation first came to his senses. “Swing the bucket this way!”\\nand putting one foot into it, so as the better to secure his slippery\\nhand-hold on the whip itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the\\ntop of the head, almost before Tashtego could have reached its\\ninterior bottom. Meantime, there was a terrible tumult. Looking over\\nthe side, they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving\\njust below the surface of the sea, as if that moment seized with\\nsome momentous idea; whereas it was only the poor Indian\\nunconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to\\nwhich he had sunk.\\nAt this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was\\nclearing the whip—which had somehow got foul of the great\\ncutting tackles—a sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the\\nunspeakable horror of all, one of the two enormous hooks\\nsuspending the head tore out, and with a vast vibration the\\nenormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship reeled and\\nshook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook, upon\\nwhich the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be\\non the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the\\nviolent motions of the head.\\n“Come down, come down!” yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but\\nwith one hand holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head\\nshould drop, he would still remain suspended; the negro having\\ncleared the foul line, rammed down the bucket into the now\\ncollapsed well, meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it,\\nand so be hoisted out.\\n“In heaven’s name, man,” cried Stubb, “are you ramming home a\\ncartridge there?—Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-\\nbound bucket on top of his head? Avast, will ye!”\\n“Stand clear of the tackle!” cried a voice like the bursting of a\\nrocket.\\nAlmost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous\\nmass dropped into the sea, like Niagara’s Table-Rock into the\\nwhirlpool; the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down\\nher glittering copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging—\\nnow over the sailors’ heads, and now over the water—Daggoo,\\nthrough a thick mist of spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the\\npendulous tackles, while poor, buried-alive Tashtego was sinking\\nutterly down to the bottom of the sea! But hardly had the blinding\\nvapor cleared away, when a naked figure with a boarding-sword in\\nhis hand, was for one swift moment seen hovering over the\\nbulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my brave\\nQueequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to\\nthe side, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed\\nmoment, and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be\\nseen. Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a\\nlittle off from the ship.\\n“Ha! ha!” cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging\\nperch overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an\\narm thrust upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as\\nan arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave.\\n“Both! both!—it is both!”—cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout;\\nand soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one\\nhand, and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian.\\nDrawn into the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck;\\nbut Tashtego was long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look\\nvery brisk.\\nNow, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving\\nafter the slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword\\nhad made side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole\\nthere; then dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards\\nand upwards, and so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred,\\nthat upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well\\nknowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion\\ngreat trouble;—he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous\\nheave and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that\\nwith the next trial, he came forth in the good old way—head\\nforemost. As for the great head itself, that was doing as well as\\ncould be expected.\\nAnd thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of\\nQueequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was\\nsuccessfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward\\nand apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no\\nmeans to be forgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same\\ncourse with fencing and boxing, riding and rowing.\\nI know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header’s will be sure\\nto seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may\\nhave either seen or heard of some one’s falling into a cistern ashore;\\nan accident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason\\ntoo than the Indian’s, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the\\ncurb of the Sperm Whale’s well.\\nBut, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We\\nthought the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the\\nlightest and most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink\\nin an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself. We have\\nthee there. Not at all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in,\\nthe case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving\\nlittle but the dense tendinous wall of the well—a double welded,\\nhammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than the\\nsea water, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost. But the\\ntendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present\\ninstance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head\\nremaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and\\ndeliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance for\\nperforming his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say. Yes, it\\nwas a running delivery, so it was.\\nNow, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very\\nprecious perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of\\nfragrant spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret\\ninner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one\\nsweeter end can readily be recalled—the delicious death of an Ohio\\nhoney-hunter, who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree,\\nfound such exceeding store of it, that leaning too far over, it sucked\\nhim in, so that he died embalmed. How many, think ye, have\\nlikewise fallen into Plato’s honey head, and sweetly perished there?\\nCHAPTER 79. The Prairie.\\nTo scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of\\nthis Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or\\nPhrenologist has as yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem\\nalmost as hopeful as for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on\\nthe Rock of Gibraltar, or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and\\nmanipulated the Dome of the Pantheon. Still, in that famous work of\\nhis, Lavater not only treats of the various faces of men, but also\\nattentively studies the faces of horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and\\ndwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible\\ntherein. Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out\\nsome hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other\\nbeings than man. Therefore, though I am but ill qualified for a\\npioneer, in the application of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I\\nwill do my endeavor. I try all things; I achieve what I can.\\nPhysiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous\\ncreature. He has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central\\nand most conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most\\nmodifies and finally controls their combined expression; hence it\\nwould seem that its entire absence, as an external appendage, must\\nvery largely affect the countenance of the whale. For as in landscape\\ngardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is\\ndeemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene; so no\\nface can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-\\nwork belfry of the nose. Dash the nose from Phidias’s marble Jove,\\nand what a sorry remainder! Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty\\na magnitude, all his proportions are so stately, that the same\\ndeficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no\\nblemish at all. Nay, it is an added grandeur. A nose to the whale\\nwould have been impertinent. As on your physiognomical voyage\\nyou sail round his vast head in your jolly-boat, your noble\\nconceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a\\nnose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which so often will insist\\nupon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on\\nhis throne.\\nIn some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical\\nview to be had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his\\nhead. This aspect is sublime.\\nIn thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with\\nthe morning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the\\nbull has a touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up\\nmountain defiles, the elephant’s brow is majestic. Human or animal,\\nthe mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German\\nemperors to their decrees. It signifies—“God: done this day by my\\nhand.” But in most creatures, nay in man himself, very often the\\nbrow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line.\\nFew are the foreheads which like Shakespeare’s or Melancthon’s rise\\nso high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves seem clear,\\neternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the\\nforehead’s wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts\\ndescending there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow\\nprints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and\\nmighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely\\namplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the Deity\\nand the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other\\nobject in living nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one\\ndistinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face;\\nhe has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a\\nforehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of\\nboats, and ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow\\ndiminish; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer\\nupon you so. In profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-\\ncrescentic depression in the forehead’s middle, which, in man, is\\nLavater’s mark of genius.\\nBut how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever\\nwritten a book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in\\nhis doing nothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in\\nhis pyramidical silence. And this reminds me that had the great\\nSperm Whale been known to the young Orient World, he would\\nhave been deified by their child-magian thoughts. They deified the\\ncrocodile of the Nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the\\nSperm Whale has no tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small,\\nas to be incapable of protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured,\\npoetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right, the merry May-\\nday gods of old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now\\negotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to\\nJove’s high seat, the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.\\nChampollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But\\nthere is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man’s and\\nevery being’s face. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is\\nbut a passing fable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty\\nlanguages, could not read the simplest peasant’s face in its\\nprofounder and more subtle meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael\\nhope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale’s brow? I but\\nput that brow before you. Read it if you can.\\nCHAPTER 80. The Nut.\\nIf the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the\\nphrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is\\nimpossible to square.\\nIn the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty\\nfeet in length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull\\nis as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on\\na level base. But in life—as we have elsewhere seen—this inclined\\nplane is angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous\\nsuperincumbent mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the\\nskull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass; while under the\\nlong floor of this crater—in another cavity seldom exceeding ten\\ninches in length and as many in depth—reposes the mere handful\\nof this monster’s brain. The brain is at least twenty feet from his\\napparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its vast outworks,\\nlike the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of\\nQuebec. So like a choice casket is it secreted in him, that I have\\nknown some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm\\nWhale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one\\nformed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in strange\\nfolds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it seems\\nmore in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that\\nmystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.\\nIt is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in\\nthe creature’s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his true\\nbrain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The whale,\\nlike all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the common\\nworld.\\nIf you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear\\nview of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its\\nresemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and\\nfrom the same point of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull\\n(scaled down to the human magnitude) among a plate of men’s\\nskulls, and you would involuntarily confound it with them; and\\nremarking the depressions on one part of its summit, in\\nphrenological phrase you would say—This man had no self-esteem,\\nand no veneration. And by those negations, considered along with\\nthe affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power, you can best\\nform to yourself the truest, though not the most exhilarating\\nconception of what the most exalted potency is.\\nBut if from the comparative dimensions of the whale’s proper\\nbrain, you deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I\\nhave another idea for you. If you attentively regard almost any\\nquadruped’s spine, you will be struck with the resemblance of its\\nvertebræ to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing\\nrudimental resemblance to the skull proper. It is a German conceit,\\nthat the vertebræ are absolutely undeveloped skulls. But the curious\\nexternal resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the first men\\nto perceive. A foreign friend once pointed it out to me, in the\\nskeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebræ of which he\\nwas inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow of his\\ncanoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an\\nimportant thing in not pushing their investigations from the\\ncerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a\\nman’s character will be found betokened in his backbone. I would\\nrather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist\\nof a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my\\nspine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half\\nout to the world.\\nApply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His\\ncranial cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that\\nvertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches\\nacross, being eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the\\nbase downwards. As it passes through the remaining vertebræ the\\ncanal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of large\\ncapacity. Now, of course, this canal is filled with much the same\\nstrangely fibrous substance—the spinal cord—as the brain; and\\ndirectly communicates with the brain. And what is still more, for\\nmany feet after emerging from the brain’s cavity, the spinal cord\\nremains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain.\\nUnder all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey\\nand map out the whale’s spine phrenologically? For, viewed in this\\nlight, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is\\nmore than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude\\nof his spinal cord.\\nBut leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I\\nwould merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference\\nto the Sperm Whale’s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not,\\nrises over one of the larger vertebræ, and is, therefore, in some sort,\\nthe outer convex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I\\nshould call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness\\nin the Sperm Whale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you\\nwill yet have reason to know.\\nCHAPTER 81. The Pequod\\nMeets The Virgin.\\nThe predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau,\\nDerick De Deer, master, of Bremen.\\nAt one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch\\nand Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very\\nwide intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet\\nwith their flag in the Pacific.\\nFor some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her\\nrespects. While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to,\\nand dropping a boat, her captain was impelled towards us,\\nimpatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern.\\n“What has he in his hand there?” cried Starbuck, pointing to\\nsomething wavingly held by the German. “Impossible!—a lamp-\\nfeeder!”\\n“Not that,” said Stubb, “no, no, it’s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he’s\\ncoming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don’t you see that\\nbig tin can there alongside of him?—that’s his boiling water. Oh!\\nhe’s all right, is the Yarman.”\\n“Go along with you,” cried Flask, “it’s a lamp-feeder and an oil-\\ncan. He’s out of oil, and has come a-begging.”\\nHowever curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil\\non the whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly\\ncontradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet\\nsometimes such a thing really happens; and in the present case\\nCaptain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as\\nFlask did declare.\\nAs he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at\\nall heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the\\nGerman soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale;\\nimmediately turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil\\ncan, with some remarks touching his having to turn into his\\nhammock at night in profound darkness—his last drop of Bremen\\noil being gone, and not a single flying-fish yet captured to supply\\nthe deficiency; concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what\\nin the Fishery is technically called a clean one (that is, an empty\\none), well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.\\nHis necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained\\nhis ship’s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from\\nthe mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was\\nDerick, that without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder\\naboard, he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan\\nlamp-feeders.\\nNow, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three\\nGerman boats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of\\nthe Pequod’s keels. There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware\\nof their danger, they were going all abreast with great speed\\nstraight before the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many\\nspans of horses in harness. They left a great, wide wake, as though\\ncontinually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea.\\nFull in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a\\nhuge, humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as\\nwell as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him,\\nseemed afflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether\\nthis whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable;\\nfor it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all\\nsocial. Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their\\nback water must have retarded him, because the white-bone or\\nswell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed\\nwhen two hostile currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and\\nlaborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending\\nitself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions\\nin him, which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity,\\ncausing the waters behind him to upbubble.\\n“Who’s got some paregoric?” said Stubb, “he has the stomach-\\nache, I’m afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache!\\nAdverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It’s the first\\nfoul wind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale\\nyaw so before? it must be, he’s lost his tiller.”\\nAs an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with\\na deck load of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows\\non her way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and\\nthen partly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause\\nof his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin.\\nWhether he had lost that fin in battle, or had been born without it,\\nit were hard to say.\\n“Only wait a bit, old chap, and I’ll give ye a sling for that\\nwounded arm,” cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near\\nhim.\\n“Mind he don’t sling thee with it,” cried Starbuck. “Give way, or\\nthe German will have him.”\\nWith one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this\\none fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the\\nmost valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other\\nwhales were going with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to\\ndefy pursuit for the time. At this juncture the Pequod’s keels had\\nshot by the three German boats last lowered; but from the great\\nstart he had had, Derick’s boat still led the chase, though every\\nmoment neared by his foreign rivals. The only thing they feared,\\nwas, that from being already so nigh to his mark, he would be\\nenabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and\\npass him. As for Derick, he seemed quite confident that this would\\nbe the case, and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his\\nlamp-feeder at the other boats.\\n“The ungracious and ungrateful dog!” cried Starbuck; “he mocks\\nand dares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five\\nminutes ago!”—then in his old intense whisper—“Give way,\\ngreyhounds! Dog to it!”\\n“I tell ye what it is, men”—cried Stubb to his crew—“it’s against\\nmy religion to get mad; but I’d like to eat that villainous Yarman—\\nPull—won’t ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye love\\nbrandy? A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why\\ndon’t some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Who’s that been dropping\\nan anchor overboard—we don’t budge an inch—we’re becalmed.\\nHalloo, here’s grass growing in the boat’s bottom—and by the Lord,\\nthe mast there’s budding. This won’t do, boys. Look at that Yarman!\\nThe short and long of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?”\\n“Oh! see the suds he makes!” cried Flask, dancing up and down\\n—“What a hump—Oh, do pile on the beef—lays like a log! Oh! my\\nlads, do spring—slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my\\nlads—baked clams and muffins—oh, do, do, spring,—he’s a hundred\\nbarreller—don’t lose him now—don’t oh, don’t!—see that Yarman—\\nOh, won’t ye pull for your duff, my lads—such a sog! such a sogger!\\nDon’t ye love sperm? There goes three thousand dollars, men!—a\\nbank!—a whole bank! The bank of England!—Oh, do, do, do!—\\nWhat’s that Yarman about now?”\\nAt this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder\\nat the advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the\\ndouble view of retarding his rivals’ way, and at the same time\\neconomically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the\\nbackward toss.\\n“The unmannerly Dutch dogger!” cried Stubb. “Pull now, men, like\\nfifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What\\nd’ye say, Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-\\ntwenty pieces for the honor of old Gayhead? What d’ye say?”\\n“I say, pull like god-dam,”—cried the Indian.\\nFiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the\\nPequod’s three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so\\ndisposed, momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous\\nattitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three\\nmates stood up proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman\\nwith an exhilarating cry of, “There she slides, now! Hurrah for the\\nwhite-ash breeze! Down with the Yarman! Sail over him!”\\nBut so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all\\ntheir gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not\\na righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught\\nthe blade of his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was\\nstriving to free his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick’s\\nboat was nigh to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a\\nmighty rage;—that was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask.\\nWith a shout, they took a mortal start forwards, and slantingly\\nranged up on the German’s quarter. An instant more, and all four\\nboats were diagonically in the whale’s immediate wake, while\\nstretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming swell that he\\nmade.\\nIt was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale\\nwas now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a\\ncontinual tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an\\nagony of fright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his\\nfaltering flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he\\nspasmodically sank in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his\\none beating fin. So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making\\naffrighted broken circles in the air, vainly striving to escape the\\npiratical hawks. But the bird has a voice, and with plaintive cries will\\nmake known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the\\nsea, was chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice, save\\nthat choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made the\\nsight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk,\\nportcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the\\nstoutest man who so pitied.\\nSeeing now that but a very few moments more would give the\\nPequod’s boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his\\ngame, Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a\\nmost unusually long dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.\\nBut no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all\\nthree tigers—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively sprang to\\ntheir feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed\\ntheir barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer,\\ntheir three Nantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapors of\\nfoam and white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale’s\\nheadlong rush, bumped the German’s aside with such force, that\\nboth Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed\\nover by the three flying keels.\\n“Don’t be afraid, my butter-boxes,” cried Stubb, casting a passing\\nglance upon them as he shot by; “ye’ll be picked up presently—all\\nright—I saw some sharks astern—St. Bernard’s dogs, you know—\\nrelieve distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every\\nkeel a sunbeam! Hurrah!—Here we go like three tin kettles at the\\ntail of a mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an\\nelephant in a tilbury on a plain—makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys,\\nwhen you fasten to him that way; and there’s danger of being\\npitched out too, when you strike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a\\nfellow feels when he’s going to Davy Jones—all a rush down an\\nendless inclined plane! Hurrah! this whale carries the everlasting\\nmail!”\\nBut the monster’s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he\\ntumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew\\nround the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves\\nin them; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid\\nsounding would soon exhaust the lines, that using all their\\ndexterous might, they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope\\nto hold on; till at last—owing to the perpendicular strain from the\\nlead-lined chocks of the boats, whence the three ropes went\\nstraight down into the blue—the gunwales of the bows were almost\\neven with the water, while the three sterns tilted high in the air. And\\nthe whale soon ceasing to sound, for some time they remained in\\nthat attitude, fearful of expending more line, though the position\\nwas a little ticklish. But though boats have been taken down and\\nlost in this way, yet it is this “holding on,” as it is called; this hooking\\nup by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that\\noften torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the\\nsharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it\\nis to be doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but\\nreasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays\\nunder water, the more he is exhausted. Because, owing to the\\nenormous surface of him—in a full grown sperm whale something\\nless than 2000 square feet—the pressure of the water is immense.\\nWe all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves\\nstand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then,\\nthe burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two\\nhundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight of fifty\\natmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of\\ntwenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men\\non board.\\nAs the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing\\ndown into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of\\nany sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its\\ndepths; what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that\\nsilence and placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing\\nand wrenching in agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope\\nwere visible at the bows. Seems it credible that by three such thin\\nthreads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an\\neight day clock. Suspended? and to what? To three bits of board. Is\\nthis the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said—“Canst\\nthou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears?\\nThe sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the spear, the\\ndart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow\\ncannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at\\nthe shaking of a spear!” This the creature? this he? Oh! that\\nunfulfilments should follow the prophets. For with the strength of a\\nthousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the\\nmountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod’s fish-spears!\\nIn that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three\\nboats sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough\\nand broad enough to shade half Xerxes’ army. Who can tell how\\nappalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge\\nphantoms flitting over his head!\\n“Stand by, men; he stirs,” cried Starbuck, as the three lines\\nsuddenly vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to\\nthem, as by magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale,\\nso that every oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment,\\nrelieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows, the\\nboats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small icefield will, when\\na dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea.\\n“Haul in! Haul in!” cried Starbuck again; “he’s rising.”\\nThe lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand’s\\nbreadth could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung\\nback all dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water\\nwithin two ship’s lengths of the hunters.\\nHis motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land\\nanimals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their\\nveins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least\\ninstantly shut off in certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of\\nwhose peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of\\nthe blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as\\na harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial\\nsystem; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure\\nof water at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said\\nto pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of\\nblood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains,\\nthat he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable\\nperiod; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the\\nwell-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the\\nboats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying\\nflukes, and the lances were darted into him, they were followed by\\nsteady jets from the new made wound, which kept continually\\nplaying, while the natural spout-hole in his head was only at\\nintervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture into the air.\\nFrom this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of him\\nhad thus far been struck. His life, as they significantly call it, was\\nuntouched.\\nAs the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper\\npart of his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was\\nplainly revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had\\nbeen, were beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-\\nholes of the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which\\nthe whale’s eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs,\\nhorribly pitiable to see. But pity there was none. For all his old age,\\nand his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be\\nmurdered, in order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings\\nof men, and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach\\nunconditional inoffensiveness by all to all. Still rolling in his blood, at\\nlast he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or\\nprotuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.\\n“A nice spot,” cried Flask; “just let me prick him there once.”\\n“Avast!” cried Starbuck, “there’s no need of that!”\\nBut humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an\\nulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more\\nthan sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with\\nswift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their\\nglorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask’s boat\\nand marring the bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so\\nspent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from\\nthe wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped\\nwith his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a\\nwaning world; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a log,\\nand died. It was most piteous, that last expiring spout. As when by\\nunseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty\\nfountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the spray-\\ncolumn lowers and lowers to the ground—so the last long dying\\nspout of the whale.\\nSoon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the\\nbody showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.\\nImmediately, by Starbuck’s orders, lines were secured to it at\\ndifferent points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken\\nwhale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords. By\\nvery heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was\\ntransferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the\\nstiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld,\\nthe body would at once sink to the bottom.\\nIt so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the\\nspade, the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found\\nimbedded in his flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before\\ndescribed. But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in\\nthe dead bodies of captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed\\naround them, and no prominence of any kind to denote their place;\\ntherefore, there must needs have been some other unknown reason\\nin the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to. But\\nstill more curious was the fact of a lance-head of stone being found\\nin him, not far from the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it.\\nWho had darted that stone lance? And when? It might have been\\ndarted by some Nor’ West Indian long before America was\\ndiscovered.\\nWhat other marvels might have been rummaged out of this\\nmonstrous cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to\\nfurther discoveries, by the ship’s being unprecedentedly dragged\\nover sideways to the sea, owing to the body’s immensely increasing\\ntendency to sink. However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of\\naffairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed,\\nthat when at length the ship would have been capsized, if still\\npersisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the command\\nwas given to break clear from it, such was the immovable strain\\nupon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables were\\nfastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime\\neverything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of\\nthe deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The\\nship groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her\\nbulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural\\ndislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear\\nupon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the\\ntimberheads; and so low had the whale now settled that the\\nsubmerged ends could not be at all approached, while every\\nmoment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking\\nbulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going over.\\n“Hold on, hold on, won’t ye?” cried Stubb to the body, “don’t be\\nin such a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do\\nsomething or go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your\\nhandspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife,\\nand cut the big chains.”\\n“Knife? Aye, aye,” cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter’s\\nheavy hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began\\nslashing at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks,\\nwere given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a\\nterrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the\\ncarcase sank.\\nNow, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\\nWhale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\\naccounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\\nbuoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\\nsurface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\\nbroken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\\nbones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason\\nassert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity\\nin the fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant\\nmatter in him. But it is not so. For young whales, in the highest\\nhealth, and swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in\\nthe warm flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about\\nthem; even these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.\\nBe it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this\\naccident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down,\\ntwenty Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt\\nimputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the\\nRight Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more\\nthan a ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free.\\nBut there are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or\\nseveral days, the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in\\nlife. But the reason of this is obvious. Gases are generated in him;\\nhe swells to a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal\\nballoon. A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then. In\\nthe Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand,\\nwhen a Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to\\nhim, with plenty of rope; so that when the body has gone down,\\nthey know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again.\\nIt was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard\\nfrom the Pequod’s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was\\nagain lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of\\na Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales,\\nbecause of its incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-\\nBack’s spout is so similar to the Sperm Whale’s, that by unskilful\\nfishermen it is often mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all\\nhis host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The\\nVirgin crowding all sail, made after her four young keels, and thus\\nthey all disappeared far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.\\nOh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.\\nCHAPTER 82. The Honor and\\nGlory of Whaling.\\nThere are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the\\ntrue method.\\nThe more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my\\nresearches up to the very spring-head of it so much the more am I\\nimpressed with its great honorableness and antiquity; and especially\\nwhen I find so many great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all\\nsorts, who one way or other have shed distinction upon it, I am\\ntransported with the reflection that I myself belong, though but\\nsubordinately, to so emblazoned a fraternity.\\nThe gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and\\nto the eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale\\nattacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.\\nThose were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore\\narms to succor the distressed, and not to fill men’s lamp-feeders.\\nEvery one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the\\nlovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the\\nsea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off,\\nPerseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned\\nthe monster, and delivered and married the maid. It was an\\nadmirable artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of\\nthe present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very\\nfirst dart. And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient\\nJoppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples,\\nthere stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the\\ncity’s legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical\\nbones of the monster that Perseus slew. When the Romans took\\nJoppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph. What\\nseems most singular and suggestively important in this story, is this:\\nit was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.\\nAkin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda—indeed, by\\nsome supposed to be indirectly derived from it—is that famous\\nstory of St. George and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to\\nhave been a whale; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons\\nare strangely jumbled together, and often stand for each other.\\n“Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a dragon of the sea,” saith\\nEzekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of\\nthe Bible use that word itself. Besides, it would much subtract from\\nthe glory of the exploit had St. George but encountered a crawling\\nreptile of the land, instead of doing battle with the great monster of\\nthe deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only a Perseus, a St.\\nGeorge, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly up to a\\nwhale.\\nLet not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though\\nthe creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely\\nrepresented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted\\non land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great\\nignorance of those times, when the true form of the whale was\\nunknown to artists; and considering that as in Perseus’ case, St.\\nGeorge’s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach;\\nand considering that the animal ridden by St. George might have\\nbeen only a large seal, or sea-horse; bearing all this in mind, it will\\nnot appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the\\nancientest draughts of the scene, to hold this so-called dragon no\\nother than the great Leviathan himself. In fact, placed before the\\nstrict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare like that fish, flesh,\\nand fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name; who being planted\\nbefore the ark of Israel, his horse’s head and both the palms of his\\nhands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy part of him\\nremained. Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a\\nwhaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights,\\nwe harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble\\norder of St. George. And therefore, let not the knights of that\\nhonorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had\\nto do with a whale like their great patron), let them never eye a\\nNantucketer with disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and\\ntarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St. George’s\\ndecoration than they.\\nWhether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I\\nlong remained dubious: for though according to the Greek\\nmythologies, that antique Crockett and Kit Carson—that brawny\\ndoer of rejoicing good deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up\\nby a whale; still, whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him, that\\nmight be mooted. It nowhere appears that he ever actually\\nharpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from the inside. Nevertheless, he\\nmay be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman; at any rate the\\nwhale caught him, if he did not the whale. I claim him for one of\\nour clan.\\nBut, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of\\nHercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still\\nmore ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versâ;\\ncertainly they are very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why not\\nthe prophet?\\nNor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise\\nthe whole roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named;\\nfor like royal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our\\nfraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves. That\\nwondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster,\\nwhich gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the\\ngodhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for\\nour Lord;—Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations,\\nhas for ever set apart and sanctified the whale. When Brahma, or\\nthe God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate the world\\nafter one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnoo, to\\npreside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose\\nperusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before\\nbeginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained\\nsomething in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these\\nVedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became\\nincarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost\\ndepths, rescued the sacred volumes. Was not this Vishnoo a\\nwhaleman, then? even as a man who rides a horse is called a\\nhorseman?\\nPerseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there’s a\\nmember-roll for you! What club but the whaleman’s can head off\\nlike that?\\nCHAPTER 83. Jonah\\nHistorically Regarded.\\nReference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the\\nwhale in the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather\\ndistrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there\\nwere some sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from\\nthe orthodox pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of\\nHercules and the whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their\\ndoubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit\\nthe less facts, for all that.\\nOne old Sag-Harbor whaleman’s chief reason for questioning the\\nHebrew story was this:—He had one of those quaint old-fashioned\\nBibles, embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which\\nrepresented Jonah’s whale with two spouts in his head—a\\npeculiarity only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the\\nRight Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the\\nfishermen have this saying, “A penny roll would choke him”; his\\nswallow is so very small. But, to this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative\\nanswer is ready. It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we\\nconsider Jonah as tombed in the whale’s belly, but as temporarily\\nlodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems reasonable\\nenough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale’s mouth\\nwould accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat\\nall the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in\\na hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is\\ntoothless.\\nAnother reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged\\nfor his want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something\\nobscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale’s\\ngastric juices. But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because\\na German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in\\nthe floating body of a dead whale—even as the French soldiers in\\nthe Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and\\ncrawled into them. Besides, it has been divined by other continental\\ncommentators, that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the\\nJoppa ship, he straightway effected his escape to another vessel\\nnear by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I would\\nadd, possibly called “The Whale,” as some craft are nowadays\\nchristened the “Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor have there been\\nwanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale\\nmentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver—an\\ninflated bag of wind—which the endangered prophet swam to, and\\nso was saved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore,\\nseems worsted all round. But he had still another reason for his\\nwant of faith. It was this, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed\\nby the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he was\\nvomited up somewhere within three days’ journey of Nineveh, a city\\non the Tigris, very much more than three days’ journey across from\\nthe nearest point of the Mediterranean coast. How is that?\\nBut was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet\\nwithin that short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried\\nhim round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak\\nof the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and\\nanother passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a\\nsupposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all\\nAfrica in three days, not to speak of the Tigris waters, near the site\\nof Nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to swim in. Besides, this\\nidea of Jonah’s weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day\\nwould wrest the honor of the discovery of that great headland from\\nBartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make modern\\nhistory a liar.\\nBut all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced\\nhis foolish pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him,\\nseeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up\\nfrom the sun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious\\npride, and abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy.\\nFor by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah’s going\\nto Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal\\nmagnification of the general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this\\nday, the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical\\nstory of Jonah. And some three centuries ago, an English traveller in\\nold Harris’s Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honor of\\nJonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without\\nany oil.\\nCHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.\\nTo make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are\\nanointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform\\nan analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom.\\nNor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it\\nmay possibly be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil\\nand water are hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object\\nin view is to make the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed\\nstrongly in anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the\\nGerman ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than customary pains\\nin that occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it hung over\\nthe side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently\\nseeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft’s bald keel. He\\nseemed to be working in obedience to some particular\\npresentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event.\\nTowards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed\\ndown to them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a\\ndisordered flight, as of Cleopatra’s barges from Actium.\\nNevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb’s was foremost. By\\ngreat exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but\\nthe stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his\\nhorizontal flight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings\\nupon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It\\nbecame imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose\\nhim. But to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam\\nso fast and furious. What then remained?\\nOf all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand\\nand countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often\\nforced, none exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called\\npitchpoling. Small sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts\\nnothing like it. It is only indispensable with an inveterate running\\nwhale; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which\\nthe long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking\\nboat, under extreme headway. Steel and wood included, the entire\\nspear is some ten or twelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter\\nthan that of the harpoon, and also of a lighter material—pine. It is\\nfurnished with a small rope called a warp, of considerable length, by\\nwhich it can be hauled back to the hand after darting.\\nBut before going further, it is important to mention here, that\\nthough the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the\\nlance, yet it is seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently\\nsuccessful, on account of the greater weight and inferior length of\\nthe harpoon as compared with the lance, which in effect become\\nserious drawbacks. As a general thing, therefore, you must first get\\nfast to a whale, before any pitchpoling comes into play.\\nLook now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate\\ncoolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially\\nqualified to excel in pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in\\nthe tossed bow of the flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing\\nwhale is forty feet ahead. Handling the long lance lightly, glancing\\ntwice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb\\nwhistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to\\nsecure its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then\\nholding the lance full before his waistband’s middle, he levels it at\\nthe whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily depresses the\\nbutt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the weapon\\nstands fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He\\nminds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin.\\nNext moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch\\nthe bright steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life\\nspot of the whale. Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red\\nblood.\\n“That drove the spigot out of him!” cried Stubb. “’Tis July’s\\nimmortal Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it\\nwere old Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old\\nMonongahela! Then, Tashtego, lad, I’d have ye hold a canakin to the\\njet, and we’d drink round it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, we’d brew\\nchoice punch in the spread of his spout-hole there, and from that\\nlive punch-bowl quaff the living stuff.”\\nAgain and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is\\nrepeated, the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in\\nskilful leash. The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is\\nslackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and\\nmutely watches the monster die.\\nCHAPTER 85. The Fountain.\\nThat for six thousand years—and no one knows how many\\nmillions of ages before—the great whales should have been\\nspouting all over the sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens\\nof the deep, as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that\\nfor some centuries back, thousands of hunters should have been\\nclose by the fountain of the whale, watching these sprinklings and\\nspoutings—that all this should be, and yet, that down to this\\nblessed minute (fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o’clock P.M.\\nof this sixteenth day of December, A.D. 1851), it should still remain a\\nproblem, whether these spoutings are, after all, really water, or\\nnothing but vapor—this is surely a noteworthy thing.\\nLet us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items\\ncontingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their\\ngills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is\\ncombined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or\\na cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the\\nsurface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him\\nregular lungs, like a human being’s, the whale can only live by\\ninhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the\\nnecessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot\\nin any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary\\nattitude, the Sperm Whale’s mouth is buried at least eight feet\\nbeneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no\\nconnexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle\\nalone; and this is on the top of his head.\\nIf I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\\nindispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\\ncertain element, which being subsequently brought into contact\\nwith the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not\\nthink I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous\\nscientific words. Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a\\nman could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his\\nnostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say,\\nhe would then live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem,\\nthis is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives, by\\nintervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without\\ndrawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a\\nparticle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between\\nhis ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a\\nremarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which\\nvessels, when he quits the surface, are completely distended with\\noxygenated blood. So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms\\nin the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the\\ncamel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink\\nfor future use in its four supplementary stomachs. The anatomical\\nfact of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition\\nfounded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to\\nme, when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that\\nleviathan in having his spoutings out, as the fishermen phrase it.\\nThis is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the\\nSperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly\\nuniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven\\nminutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths;\\nthen whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy\\nbreaths over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few\\nbreaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always\\ndodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air. And\\nnot till those seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to\\nstay out his full term below. Remark, however, that in different\\nindividuals these rates are different; but in any one they are alike.\\nNow, why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings\\nout, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere descending for\\ngood? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the whale’s\\nrising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not by\\nhook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a\\nthousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then,\\nO hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!\\nIn man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only\\nserving for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business\\nhe has to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he\\nwill. But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or\\nSunday of his time.\\nIt has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-\\nhole; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with\\nwater, then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his\\nsense of smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about\\nhim that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and\\nbeing so clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to\\nhave the power of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout\\n—whether it be water or whether it be vapor—no absolute certainty\\ncan as yet be arrived at on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that\\nthe Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories. But what does he want\\nof them? No roses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.\\nFurthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his\\nspouting canal, and as that long canal—like the grand Erie Canal—is\\nfurnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the\\ndownward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water,\\ntherefore the whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying,\\nthat when he so strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose. But\\nthen again, what has the whale to say? Seldom have I known any\\nprofound being that had anything to say to this world, unless forced\\nto stammer out something by way of getting a living. Oh! happy\\nthat the world is such an excellent listener!\\nNow, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as\\nit is for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\\nhorizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little\\nto one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid\\ndown in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns\\nwhether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether\\nthe spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled\\nbreath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in\\nat the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that\\nthe mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it\\ncannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water\\nthrough the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing\\nwould seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water.\\nBut the Sperm Whale’s food is far beneath the surface, and there he\\ncannot spout even if he would. Besides, if you regard him very\\nclosely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when\\nunmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of\\nhis jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.\\nBut why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak\\nout! You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can\\nyou not tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so\\neasy to settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things\\nthe knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost\\nstand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.\\nThe central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist\\nenveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls\\nfrom it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get\\na close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the\\nwater cascading all around him. And if at such times you should\\nthink that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how\\ndo you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor; or\\nhow do you know that they are not those identical drops\\nsuperficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk\\ninto the summit of the whale’s head? For even when tranquilly\\nswimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated\\nhump sun-dried as a dromedary’s in the desert; even then, the\\nwhale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a\\nblazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with\\nrain.\\nNor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching\\nthe precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be\\npeering into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your\\npitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when\\ncoming into slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet,\\nwhich will often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the\\nacridness of the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming\\ninto still closer contact with the spout, whether with some scientific\\nobject in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from\\nhis cheek and arm. Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is\\ndeemed poisonous; they try to evade it. Another thing; I have heard\\nit said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is fairly spouted\\ninto your eyes, it will blind you. The wisest thing the investigator can\\ndo then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly spout alone.\\nStill, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish.\\nMy hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And\\nbesides other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by\\nconsiderations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of\\nthe Sperm Whale; I account him no common, shallow being,\\ninasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on\\nsoundings, or near shores; all other whales sometimes are. He is\\nboth ponderous and profound. And I am convinced that from the\\nheads of all ponderous profound beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the\\nDevil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain\\nsemi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts. While\\ncomposing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a\\nmirror before me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious\\ninvolved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head.\\nThe invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep thought,\\nafter six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an August\\nnoon; this seems an additional argument for the above supposition.\\nAnd how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster,\\nto behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast,\\nmild head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his\\nincommunicable contemplations, and that vapor—as you will\\nsometimes see it—glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put\\nits seal upon his thoughts. For, d’ye see, rainbows do not visit the\\nclear air; they only irradiate vapor. And so, through all the thick\\nmists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then\\nshoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray. And for this I thank\\nGod; for all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few\\nalong with them, have intuitions. Doubts of all things earthly, and\\nintuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes neither\\nbeliever nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with\\nequal eye.\\nCHAPTER 86. The Tail.\\nOther poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the\\nantelope, and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less\\ncelestial, I celebrate a tail.\\nReckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale’s tail to begin at that\\npoint of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it\\ncomprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty\\nsquare feet. The compact round body of its root expands into two\\nbroad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than\\nan inch in thickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly\\noverlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a\\nwide vacancy between. In no living thing are the lines of beauty\\nmore exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these\\nflukes. At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the tail will\\nconsiderably exceed twenty feet across.\\nThe entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews;\\nbut cut into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:—\\nupper, middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers,\\nare long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and\\nrunning crosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure,\\nas much as anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student\\nof old Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to\\nthe thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those\\nwonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute\\nso much to the great strength of the masonry.\\nBut as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not\\nenough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and\\nwoof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side\\nthe loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with\\nthem, and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the\\nconfluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated\\nto a point. Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to\\ndo it.\\nNor does this—its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the\\ngraceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates\\nthrough a Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive\\ntheir most appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs\\nbeauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything\\nimposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take\\naway the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble\\nin the carved Hercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout\\nEckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he\\nwas overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man, that seemed\\nas a Roman triumphal arch. When Angelo paints even God the\\nFather in human form, mark what robustness is there. And whatever\\nthey may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,\\nhermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most\\nsuccessfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of all\\nbrawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative,\\nfeminine one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is\\nconceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.\\nSuch is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether\\nwielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it\\nbe in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein\\nno fairy’s arm can transcend it.\\nFive great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for\\nprogression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in\\nsweeping; Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\\nFirst: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan’s tail acts in a\\ndifferent manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never\\nwriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the\\nwhale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled\\nforwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is\\nthis which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the\\nmonster when furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer\\nby.\\nSecond: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\\nfights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in\\nhis conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail.\\nIn striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and\\nthe blow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the\\nunobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is\\nthen simply irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it.\\nYour only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways\\nthrough the opposing water, then partly owing to the light\\nbuoyancy of the whale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a\\ncracked rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is\\ngenerally the most serious result. These submerged side blows are\\nso often received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child’s\\nplay. Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.\\nThird: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the\\nwhale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this\\nrespect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of\\nthe elephant’s trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\\nsweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\\nslowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the\\nsurface of the sea; and if he feel but a sailor’s whisker, woe to that\\nsailor, whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary\\ntouch! Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway\\nbethink me of Darmonodes’ elephant that so frequented the flower-\\nmarket, and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels,\\nand then caressed their zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it\\nis that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail;\\nfor I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded in the\\nfight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.\\nFourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security\\nof the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast\\ncorpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if\\nit were a hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad\\npalms of his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the\\nsurface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would\\nalmost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed\\nthe light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity,\\nyou would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.\\nFifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the\\nflukes lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then\\ncompletely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about\\nto plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of\\nhis body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a\\nmoment, till they downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the\\nsublime breach—somewhere else to be described—this peaking of\\nthe whale’s flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all\\nanimated nature. Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail\\nseems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven. So in dreams,\\nhave I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal\\nclaw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in gazing at such scenes, it is\\nall in all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will\\noccur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels. Standing at the\\nmast-head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I\\nonce saw a large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the\\nsun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes. As it\\nseemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration\\nof the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire\\nworshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant,\\nI then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of\\nall beings. For according to King Juba, the military elephants of\\nantiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the\\nprofoundest silence.\\nThe chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and\\nthe elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the\\ntrunk of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those\\ntwo opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to\\nwhich they respectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but\\na terrier to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan’s tail, his trunk is\\nbut the stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant’s\\ntrunk were as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the\\nmeasureless crush and crash of the sperm whale’s ponderous flukes,\\nwhich in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire\\nboats with all their oars and crews into the air, very much as an\\nIndian juggler tosses his balls.*\\n*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the\\nwhale and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that\\nparticular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the\\nwhale that a dog does to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not\\nwanting some points of curious similitude; among these is the\\nspout. It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or\\ndust in his trunk, and then elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.\\nThe more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my\\ninability to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which,\\nthough they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly\\ninexplicable. In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are\\nthese mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared\\nthem akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed,\\nby these methods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are\\nthere wanting other motions of the whale in his general body, full of\\nstrangeness, and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant.\\nDissect him how I may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not,\\nand never will. But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how\\nunderstand his head? much more, how comprehend his face, when\\nface he has none? Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems\\nto say, but my face shall not be seen. But I cannot completely make\\nout his back parts; and hint what he will about his face, I say again\\nhe has no face.\\nCHAPTER 87. The Grand\\nArmada.\\nThe long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-\\neastward from the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly\\npoint of all Asia. In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the\\nlong islands of Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many\\nothers, form a vast mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia\\nwith Australia, and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from\\nthe thickly studded oriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced\\nby several sally-ports for the convenience of ships and whales;\\nconspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca. By\\nthe straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the west,\\nemerge into the China seas.\\nThose narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and\\nstanding midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that\\nbold green promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a\\nlittle correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast\\nwalled empire: and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices,\\nand silks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand\\nislands of that oriental sea are enriched, it seems a significant\\nprovision of nature, that such treasures, by the very formation of the\\nland, should at least bear the appearance, however ineffectual, of\\nbeing guarded from the all-grasping western world. The shores of\\nthe Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering\\nfortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the\\nBaltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these Orientals do not\\ndemand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the\\nendless procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries\\npast, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of\\nSumatra and Java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east.\\nBut while they freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no\\nmeans renounce their claim to more solid tribute.\\nTime out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among\\nthe low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon\\nthe vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at\\nthe point of their spears. Though by the repeated bloody\\nchastisements they have received at the hands of European cruisers,\\nthe audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed;\\nyet, even at the present day, we occasionally hear of English and\\nAmerican vessels, which, in those waters, have been remorselessly\\nboarded and pillaged.\\nWith a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to\\nthese straits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan\\nsea, and thence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be\\nfrequented here and there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by\\nthe Philippine Islands, and gain the far coast of Japan, in time for\\nthe \\ngreat \\nwhaling \\nseason \\nthere. \\nBy \\nthese \\nmeans, \\nthe\\ncircumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm\\nWhale cruising grounds of the world, previous to descending upon\\nthe Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere else foiled in\\nhis pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the\\nsea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he\\nmight most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.\\nBut how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land?\\ndoes his crew drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a\\nlong time, now, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery\\nring, and needs no sustenance but what’s in himself. So Ahab. Mark\\nthis, too, in the whaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien\\nstuff, to be transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering\\nwhale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and\\ntheir wants. She has a whole lake’s contents bottled in her ample\\nhold. She is ballasted with utilities; not altogether with unusable\\npig-lead and kentledge. She carries years’ water in her. Clear old\\nprime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat, the\\nNantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish fluid,\\nbut yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian\\nstreams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China\\nfrom New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the\\nwhale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of\\nsoil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like\\nthemselves. So that did you carry them the news that another flood\\nhad come; they would only answer—“Well, boys, here’s the ark!”\\nNow, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western\\ncoast of Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as\\nmost of the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the\\nfishermen as an excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod\\ngained more and more upon Java Head, the look-outs were\\nrepeatedly hailed, and admonished to keep wide awake. But though\\nthe green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard\\nbow, and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in\\nthe air, yet not a single jet was descried. Almost renouncing all\\nthought of falling in with any game hereabouts, the ship had well\\nnigh entered the straits, when the customary cheering cry was\\nheard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence\\nsaluted us.\\nBut here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with\\nwhich of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm\\nWhales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached\\ncompanies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in\\nextensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it\\nwould almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn\\nsolemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection.\\nTo this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense\\ncaravans, may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best\\ncruising grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and\\nmonths together, without being greeted by a single spout; and then\\nbe suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on\\nthousands.\\nBroad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles,\\nand forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level\\nhorizon, a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and\\nsparkling in the noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-\\njets of the Right Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two\\nbranches, like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single\\nforward-slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled\\nbush of white mist, continually rising and falling away to leeward.\\nSeen from the Pequod’s deck, then, as she would rise on a high\\nhill of the sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into\\nthe air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze,\\nshowed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense\\nmetropolis, descried of a balmy autumnal morning, by some\\nhorseman on a height.\\nAs marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the\\nmountains, accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that\\nperilous passage in their rear, and once more expand in comparative\\nsecurity upon the plain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now\\nseem hurrying forward through the straits; gradually contracting the\\nwings of their semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still\\ncrescentic centre.\\nCrowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers\\nhandling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their\\nyet suspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they,\\nthat chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only\\ndeploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of\\ntheir number. And who could tell whether, in that congregated\\ncaravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like\\nthe worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the\\nSiamese! So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along,\\ndriving these leviathans before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of\\nTashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to something in our\\nwake.\\nCorresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in\\nour rear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and\\nfalling something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so\\ncompletely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without\\nfinally disappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly\\nrevolved in his pivot-hole, crying, “Aloft there, and rig whips and\\nbuckets to wet the sails;—Malays, sir, and after us!”\\nAs if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod\\nshould fairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were\\nnow in hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. But\\nwhen the swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot\\nchase; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in\\nspeeding her on to her own chosen pursuit,—mere riding-whips\\nand rowels to her, that they were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-\\nand-fro paced the deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters\\nhe chased, and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him;\\nsome such fancy as the above seemed his. And when he glanced\\nupon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was\\nthen sailing, and bethought him that through that gate lay the route\\nto his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that same gate he\\nwas now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end; and not\\nonly that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman\\natheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curses;—\\nwhen all these conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab’s brow\\nwas left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after some\\nstormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the\\nfirm thing from its place.\\nBut thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew;\\nand when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern,\\nthe Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the\\nSumatra side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then,\\nthe harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had\\nbeen gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so\\nvictoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake\\nof the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually\\nthe ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was\\npassed to spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by some\\npresumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified\\nof the three keels that were after them,—though as yet a mile in\\ntheir rear,—than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and\\nbattalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of\\nstacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.\\nStripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash,\\nand after several hours’ pulling were almost disposed to renounce\\nthe chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales\\ngave animating token that they were now at last under the influence\\nof that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the\\nfishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied. The\\ncompact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly\\nand steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless\\nrout; and like King Porus’ elephants in the Indian battle with\\nAlexander, they seemed going mad with consternation. In all\\ndirections expanding in vast irregular circles, and aimlessly\\nswimming hither and thither, by their short thick spoutings, they\\nplainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was still more\\nstrangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely\\nparalysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled\\nships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple\\nsheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could\\nnot possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional\\ntimidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though\\nbanding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of\\nthe West have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all\\nhuman beings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a\\ntheatre’s pit, they will, at the slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-\\nskelter for the outlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and\\nremorselessly dashing each other to death. Best, therefore, withhold\\nany amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us, for there\\nis no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone\\nby the madness of men.\\nThough many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent\\nmotion, yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither\\nadvanced nor retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is\\ncustomary in those cases, the boats at once separated, each making\\nfor some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about\\nthree minutes’ time, Queequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish\\ndarted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us\\nlike light, steered straight for the heart of the herd. Though such a\\nmovement on the part of the whale struck under such\\ncircumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost\\nalways more or less anticipated; yet does it present one of the more\\nperilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift monster drags\\nyou deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to\\ncircumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.\\nAs, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer\\npower of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to\\nhim; as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced\\nas we flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our\\nbeset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and\\nstriving to steer through their complicated channels and straits,\\nknowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed.\\nBut not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now\\nsheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance;\\nnow edging away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended\\noverhead, while all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in\\nhand, pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by\\nshort darts, for there was no time to make long ones. Nor were the\\noarsmen quite idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether\\ndispensed with. They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the\\nbusiness. “Out of the way, Commodore!” cried one, to a great\\ndromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface, and for an\\ninstant threatened to swamp us. “Hard down with your tail, there!”\\ncried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed\\ncalmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.\\nAll whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally\\ninvented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares\\nof wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they\\ncross each other’s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length\\nis then attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of\\nthe line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon.\\nIt is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then,\\nmore whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at\\none time. But sperm whales are not every day encountered; while\\nyou may, then, you must kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them\\nall at once, you must wing them, so that they can be afterwards\\nkilled at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these the drugg,\\ncomes into requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them.\\nThe first and second were successfully darted, and we saw the\\nwhales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong\\nresistance of the towing drugg. They were cramped like malefactors\\nwith the chain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of\\ntossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of\\nthe seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and carried it\\naway, dropping the oarsman in the boat’s bottom as the seat slid\\nfrom under him. On both sides the sea came in at the wounded\\nplanks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in, and so\\nstopped the leaks for the time.\\nIt had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons,\\nwere it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale’s way\\ngreatly diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and\\nfurther from the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders\\nseemed waning. So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out,\\nand the towing whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering\\nforce of his parting momentum, we glided between two whales into\\nthe innermost heart of the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent\\nwe had slid into a serene valley lake. Here the storms in the roaring\\nglens between the outermost whales, were heard but not felt. In this\\ncentral expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface,\\ncalled a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the\\nwhale in his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted\\ncalm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion. And still\\nin the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer\\nconcentric circles, and saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in\\neach, swiftly going round and round, like multiplied spans of horses\\nin a ring; and so closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-\\nrider might easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have\\ngone round on their backs. Owing to the density of the crowd of\\nreposing whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed axis\\nof the herd, no possible chance of escape was at present afforded\\nus. We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us\\nin; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up.\\nKeeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by\\nsmall tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed\\nhost.\\nNow, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the\\nrevolving outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the\\nvarious pods in any one of those circles, the entire area at this\\njuncture, embraced by the whole multitude, must have contained at\\nleast two or three square miles. At any rate—though indeed such a\\ntest at such a time might be deceptive—spoutings might be\\ndiscovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from\\nthe rim of the horizon. I mention this circumstance, because, as if\\nthe cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost\\nfold; and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented\\nthem from learning the precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly,\\nbeing so young, unsophisticated, and every way innocent and\\ninexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller whales—\\nnow and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the\\nlake—evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still\\nbecharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like\\nhousehold dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our\\ngunwales, and touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell\\nhad suddenly domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads;\\nStarbuck scratched their backs with his lance; but fearful of the\\nconsequences, for the time refrained from darting it.\\nBut far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another\\nand still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For,\\nsuspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing\\nmothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth\\nseemed shortly to become mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was\\nto a considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human\\ninfants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the\\nbreast, as if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet\\ndrawing mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some\\nunearthly reminiscence;—even so did the young of these whales\\nseem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit\\nof Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their sides, the\\nmothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little infants,\\nthat from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might have\\nmeasured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth.\\nHe was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet\\nrecovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in\\nthe maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final\\nspring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar’s bow. The delicate\\nside-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the plaited\\ncrumpled appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived from foreign\\nparts.\\n“Line! line!” cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; “him fast!\\nhim fast!—Who line him! Who struck?—Two whale; one big, one\\nlittle!”\\n“What ails ye, man?” cried Starbuck.\\n“Look-e here,” said Queequeg, pointing down.\\nAs when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out\\nhundreds of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up\\nagain, and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and\\nspiralling towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the\\numbilical cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub\\nseemed still tethered to its dam. Not seldom in the rapid\\nvicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with the maternal end\\nloose, becomes entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is\\nthereby trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed\\ndivulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan\\namours in the deep.*\\n*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but\\nunlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a\\ngestation which may probably be set down at nine months,\\nproducing but one at a time; though in some few known instances\\ngiving birth to an Esau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in\\nsuckling by two teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the\\nanus; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that. When\\nby chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the\\nhunter’s lance, the mother’s pouring milk and blood rivallingly\\ndiscolour the sea for rods. The milk is very sweet and rich; it has\\nbeen tasted by man; it might do well with strawberries. When\\noverflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute more hominum.\\nAnd thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of\\nconsternations and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the\\ncentre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments;\\nyea, serenely revelled in dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the\\ntornadoed Atlantic of my being, do I myself still for ever centrally\\ndisport in mute calm; and while ponderous planets of unwaning\\nwoe revolve round me, deep down and deep inland there I still\\nbathe me in eternal mildness of joy.\\nMeanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden\\nfrantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other\\nboats, still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the\\nhost; or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where\\nabundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded\\nthem. But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then\\nblindly darting to and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at\\nlast met our eyes. It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale\\nmore than commonly powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him,\\nas it were, by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is\\ndone by darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached\\na rope for hauling it back again. A whale wounded (as we\\nafterwards learned) in this part, but not effectually, as it seemed,\\nhad broken away from the boat, carrying along with him half of the\\nharpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was\\nnow dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted\\ndesperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay\\nwherever he went.\\nBut agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling\\nspectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he\\nseemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which\\nat first the intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we\\nperceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery,\\nthis whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he\\ntowed; he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and\\nwhile the free end of the rope attached to that weapon, had\\npermanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round his tail,\\nthe cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh. So that\\ntormented to madness, he was now churning through the water,\\nviolently flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade\\nabout him, wounding and murdering his own comrades.\\nThis terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their\\nstationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake\\nbegan to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted\\nby half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to\\nheave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries\\nvanished; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the\\nmore central circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the\\nlong calm was departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard;\\nand then like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great\\nriver Hudson breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came\\ntumbling upon their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one\\ncommon mountain. Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed\\nplaces; Starbuck taking the stern.\\n“Oars! Oars!” he intensely whispered, seizing the helm—“gripe\\nyour oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by!\\nShove him off, you Queequeg—the whale there!—prick him!—hit\\nhim! Stand up—stand up, and stay so! Spring, men—pull, men;\\nnever mind their backs—scrape them!—scrape away!”\\nThe boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks,\\nleaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by\\ndesperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then\\ngiving way rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for\\nanother outlet. After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last\\nswiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles, but\\nnow crossed by random whales, all violently making for one centre.\\nThis lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of\\nQueequeg’s hat, who, while standing in the bows to prick the\\nfugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head by the air-\\neddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by.\\nRiotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it\\nsoon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for\\nhaving clumped together at last in one dense body, they then\\nrenewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further\\npursuit was useless; but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick\\nup what drugged whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to\\nsecure one which Flask had killed and waifed. The waif is a\\npennoned pole, two or three of which are carried by every boat;\\nand which, when additional game is at hand, are inserted upright\\ninto the floating body of a dead whale, both to mark its place on\\nthe sea, and also as token of prior possession, should the boats of\\nany other ship draw near.\\nThe result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that\\nsagacious saying in the Fishery,—the more whales the less fish. Of\\nall the drugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to\\nescape for the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen,\\nby some other craft than the Pequod.\\nCHAPTER 88. Schools and\\nSchoolmasters.\\nThe previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd\\nof Sperm Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause\\ninducing those vast aggregations.\\nNow, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as\\nmust have been seen, even at the present day, small detached\\nbands are occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty\\nindividuals each. Such bands are known as schools. They generally\\nare of two sorts; those composed almost entirely of females, and\\nthose mustering none but young vigorous males, or bulls, as they\\nare familiarly designated.\\nIn cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably\\nsee a male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any\\nalarm, evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the\\nflight of his ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman,\\nswimming about over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied\\nby all the solaces and endearments of the harem. The contrast\\nbetween this Ottoman and his concubines is striking; because, while\\nhe is always of the largest leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even\\nat full growth, are not more than one-third of the bulk of an\\naverage-sized male. They are comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare\\nsay, not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist. Nevertheless,\\nit cannot be denied, that upon the whole they are hereditarily\\nentitled to en bon point.\\nIt is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent\\nramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in\\nleisurely search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the\\nfull flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned,\\nperhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so\\ncheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the\\ntime they have lounged up and down the promenade of the\\nEquator awhile, they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of\\nthe cool season there, and so evade the other excessive\\ntemperature of the year.\\nWhen serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange\\nsuspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his\\ninteresting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan\\ncoming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the\\nladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases\\nhim away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him\\nare to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though\\ndo what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious\\nLothario out of his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore,\\nthe ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival\\nadmirers; just so with the whales, who sometimes come to deadly\\nbattle, and all for love. They fence with their long lower jaws,\\nsometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy\\nlike elks that warringly interweave their antlers. Not a few are\\ncaptured having the deep scars of these encounters,—furrowed\\nheads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances,\\nwrenched and dislocated mouths.\\nBut supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself\\naway at the first rush of the harem’s lord, then is it very diverting to\\nwatch that lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them\\nagain and revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young\\nLothario, like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his\\nthousand concubines. Granting other whales to be in sight, the\\nfishermen will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks; for\\nthese Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength, and hence their\\nunctuousness is small. As for the sons and the daughters they\\nbeget, why, those sons and daughters must take care of themselves;\\nat least, with only the maternal help. For like certain other\\nomnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my Lord Whale has\\nno taste for the nursery, however much for the bower; and so,\\nbeing a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all over the\\nworld; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as the\\nardour of youth declines; as years and dumps increase; as reflection\\nlends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude overtakes\\nthe sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for\\nmaidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant,\\nadmonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown\\nto an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the\\nmeridians and parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young\\nLeviathan from his amorous errors.\\nNow, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school,\\nso is the lord and master of that school technically known as the\\nschoolmaster. It is therefore not in strict character, however\\nadmirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he should\\nthen go abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly\\nof it. His title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from\\nthe name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised\\nthat the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale,\\nmust have read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what\\nsort of a country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his\\nyounger days, and what was the nature of those occult lessons he\\ninculcated into some of his pupils.\\nThe same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster\\nwhale betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged\\nSperm Whales. Almost universally, a lone whale—as a solitary\\nLeviathan is called—proves an ancient one. Like venerable moss-\\nbearded Daniel Boone, he will have no one near him but Nature\\nherself; and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters, and the\\nbest of wives she is, though she keeps so many moody secrets.\\nThe schools composing none but young and vigorous males,\\npreviously mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools.\\nFor while those female whales are characteristically timid, the young\\nmales, or forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most\\npugnacious of all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous\\nto encounter; excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled\\nwhales, sometimes met, and these will fight you like grim fiends\\nexasperated by a penal gout.\\nThe Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools.\\nLike a mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and\\nwickedness, tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking\\nrate, that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than\\nhe would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this\\nturbulence though, and when about three-fourths grown, break up,\\nand separately go about in quest of settlements, that is, harems.\\nAnother point of difference between the male and female schools\\nis still more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a Forty-barrel-\\nbull—poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a member of\\nthe harem school, and her companions swim around her with every\\ntoken of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as\\nthemselves to fall a prey.\\nCHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and\\nLoose-Fish.\\nThe allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but\\none, necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the\\nwhale fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol\\nand badge.\\nIt frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in\\ncompany, a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be\\nfinally killed and captured by another vessel; and herein are\\nindirectly comprised many minor contingencies, all partaking of this\\none grand feature. For example,—after a weary and perilous chase\\nand capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by\\nreason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to leeward, be\\nretaken by a second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it\\nalongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the most vexatious and\\nviolent disputes would often arise between the fishermen, were\\nthere not some written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law\\napplicable to all cases.\\nPerhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative\\nenactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-\\nGeneral in A.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any\\nwritten whaling law, yet the American fishermen have been their\\nown legislators and lawyers in this matter. They have provided a\\nsystem which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian’s\\nPandects and the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the\\nSuppression of Meddling with other People’s Business. Yes; these\\nlaws might be engraven on a Queen Anne’s farthing, or the barb of\\na harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they.\\nI. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.\\nII. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.\\nBut what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the\\nadmirable brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of\\ncommentaries to expound it.\\nFirst: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast,\\nwhen it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium\\nat all controllable by the occupant or occupants,—a mast, an oar, a\\nnine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the\\nsame. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any\\nother recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing\\nit plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well\\nas their intention so to do.\\nThese are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the\\nwhalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder\\nknocks—the Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more\\nupright and honorable whalemen allowances are always made for\\npeculiar cases, where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for\\none party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed\\nby another party. But others are by no means so scrupulous.\\nSome fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover\\nlitigated in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard\\nchase of a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the\\nplaintiffs) had succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last,\\nthrough peril of their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines,\\nbut their boat itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another\\nship) came up with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally\\nappropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when\\nthose defendants were remonstrated with, their captain snapped his\\nfingers in the plaintiffs’ teeth, and assured them that by way of\\ndoxology to the deed he had done, he would now retain their line,\\nharpoons, and boat, which had remained attached to the whale at\\nthe time of the seizure. Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the\\nrecovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.\\nMr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough\\nwas the judge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went\\non to illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,\\nwherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife’s\\nviciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in\\nthe course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to\\nrecover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he\\nthen supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had\\noriginally harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only\\nby reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last\\nabandoned her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a\\nloose-fish; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-\\nharpooned her, the lady then became that subsequent gentleman’s\\nproperty, along with whatever harpoon might have been found\\nsticking in her.\\nNow in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of\\nthe whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.\\nThese pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the\\nvery learned judge in set terms decided, to wit,—That as for the\\nboat, he awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely\\nabandoned it to save their lives; but that with regard to the\\ncontroverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the\\ndefendants; the whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of\\nthe final capture; and the harpoons and line because when the fish\\nmade off with them, it (the fish) acquired a property in those\\narticles; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a\\nright to them. Now the defendants afterwards took the fish; ergo,\\nthe aforesaid articles were theirs.\\nA common man looking at this decision of the very learned\\nJudge, might possibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary\\nrock of the matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin\\nwhaling laws previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord\\nEllenborough in the above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-\\nFish and Loose-Fish, I say, will, on reflection, be found the\\nfundamentals of all human jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its\\ncomplicated tracery of sculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the\\nTemple of the Philistines, has but two props to stand on.\\nIs it not a saying in every one’s mouth, Possession is half of the\\nlaw: that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But\\noften possession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and\\nsouls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof\\npossession is the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord\\nis the widow’s last mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected\\nvillain’s marble mansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that\\nbut a Fast-Fish? What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the\\nbroker, gets from poor Woebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep\\nWoebegone’s family from starvation; what is that ruinous discount\\nbut a Fast-Fish? What is the Archbishop of Savesoul’s income of\\n£100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of\\nthousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven without any\\nof Savesoul’s help) what is that globular £100,000 but a Fast-Fish?\\nWhat are the Duke of Dunder’s hereditary towns and hamlets but\\nFast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer, John Bull, is poor\\nIreland, but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic lancer, Brother\\nJonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all these, is not\\nPossession the whole of the law?\\nBut if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the\\nkindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is\\ninternationally and universally applicable.\\nWhat was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus\\nstruck the Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master\\nand mistress? What was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the\\nTurk? What India to England? What at last will Mexico be to the\\nUnited States? All Loose-Fish.\\nWhat are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but\\nLoose-Fish? What all men’s minds and opinions but Loose-Fish?\\nWhat is the principle of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish?\\nWhat to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of\\nthinkers but Loose-Fish? What is the great globe itself but a Loose-\\nFish? And what are you, reader, but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish,\\ntoo?\\nCHAPTER 90. Heads or Tails.\\n“De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.”\\nBracton, l. 3, c. 3.\\nLatin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along\\nwith the context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on\\nthe coast of that land, the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer,\\nmust have the head, and the Queen be respectfully presented with\\nthe tail. A division which, in the whale, is much like halving an apple;\\nthere is no intermediate remainder. Now as this law, under a\\nmodified form, is to this day in force in England; and as it offers in\\nvarious respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast\\nand Loose-Fish, it is here treated of in a separate chapter, on the\\nsame courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at\\nthe expense of a separate car, specially reserved for the\\naccommodation of royalty. In the first place, in curious proof of the\\nfact that the above-mentioned law is still in force, I proceed to lay\\nbefore you a circumstance that happened within the last two years.\\nIt seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or\\nsome one of the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in\\nkilling and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried\\nafar off from the shore. Now the Cinque Ports are partially or\\nsomehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle,\\ncalled a Lord Warden. Holding the office directly from the crown, I\\nbelieve, all the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port\\nterritories become by assignment his. By some writers this office is\\ncalled a sinecure. But not so. Because the Lord Warden is busily\\nemployed at times in fobbing his perquisites; which are his chiefly\\nby virtue of that same fobbing of them.\\nNow when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with\\ntheir trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled\\ntheir fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good £150 from\\nthe precious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their\\nwives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their\\nrespective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and\\ncharitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and\\nlaying it upon the whale’s head, he says—“Hands off! this fish, my\\nmasters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord Warden’s.” Upon this the\\npoor mariners in their respectful consternation—so truly English—\\nknowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their heads all\\nround; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger.\\nBut that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the hard\\nheart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At\\nlength one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made\\nbold to speak,\\n“Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?”\\n“The Duke.”\\n“But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?”\\n“It is his.”\\n“We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and\\nis all that to go to the Duke’s benefit; we getting nothing at all for\\nour pains but our blisters?”\\n“It is his.”\\n“Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode\\nof getting a livelihood?”\\n“It is his.”\\n“I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my\\nshare of this whale.”\\n“It is his.”\\n“Won’t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?”\\n“It is his.”\\nIn a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke\\nof Wellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some\\nparticular lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small\\ndegree be deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an\\nhonest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his\\nGrace, begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners\\ninto full consideration. To which my Lord Duke in substance replied\\n(both letters were published) that he had already done so, and\\nreceived the money, and would be obliged to the reverend\\ngentleman if for the future he (the reverend gentleman) would\\ndecline meddling with other people’s business. Is this the still\\nmilitant old man, standing at the corners of the three kingdoms, on\\nall hands coercing alms of beggars?\\nIt will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the\\nDuke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We\\nmust needs inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is\\noriginally invested with that right. The law itself has already been set\\nforth. But Plowdon gives us the reason for it. Says Plowdon, the\\nwhale so caught belongs to the King and Queen, “because of its\\nsuperior excellence.” And by the soundest commentators this has\\never been held a cogent argument in such matters.\\nBut why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail?\\nA reason for that, ye lawyers!\\nIn his treatise on “Queen-Gold,” or Queen-pinmoney, an old King’s\\nBench author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: “Ye tail is ye\\nQueen’s, that ye Queen’s wardrobe may be supplied with ye\\nwhalebone.” Now this was written at a time when the black limber\\nbone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies’\\nbodices. But this same bone is not in the tail; it is in the head, which\\nis a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen\\na mermaid, to be presented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may\\nlurk here.\\nThere are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers—the\\nwhale and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain\\nlimitations, and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown’s\\nordinary revenue. I know not that any other author has hinted of\\nthe matter; but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must\\nbe divided in the same way as the whale, the King receiving the\\nhighly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish, which,\\nsymbolically regarded, may possibly be humorously grounded upon\\nsome presumed congeniality. And thus there seems a reason in all\\nthings, even in law.\\nCHAPTER 91. The Pequod\\nMeets The Rose-Bud.\\n“In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this\\nLeviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.” Sir T. Browne, V.E.\\nIt was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and\\nwhen we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that\\nthe many noses on the Pequod’s deck proved more vigilant\\ndiscoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not\\nvery pleasant smell was smelt in the sea.\\n“I will bet something now,” said Stubb, “that somewhere\\nhereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other\\nday. I thought they would keel up before long.”\\nPresently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the\\ndistance lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of\\nwhale must be alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed\\nFrench colours from his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture\\nsea-fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was\\nplain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a\\nblasted whale, that is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea,\\nand so floated an unappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived,\\nwhat an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale; worse than an\\nAssyrian city in the plague, when the living are incompetent to bury\\nthe departed. So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that no\\ncupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it. Yet are there\\nthose who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil\\nobtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no\\nmeans of the nature of attar-of-rose.\\nComing still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the\\nFrenchman had a second whale alongside; and this second whale\\nseemed even more of a nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned\\nout to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up\\nand die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving\\ntheir defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil.\\nNevertheless, in the proper place we shall see that no knowing\\nfisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this,\\nhowever much he may shun blasted whales in general.\\nThe Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb\\nvowed he recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines\\nthat were knotted round the tail of one of these whales.\\n“There’s a pretty fellow, now,” he banteringly laughed, standing in\\nthe ship’s bows, “there’s a jackal for ye! I well know that these\\nCrappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery;\\nsometimes lowering their boats for breakers, mistaking them for\\nSperm Whale spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their port\\nwith their hold full of boxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuffers,\\nforeseeing that all the oil they will get won’t be enough to dip the\\nCaptain’s wick into; aye, we all know these things; but look ye, here’s\\na Crappo that is content with our leavings, the drugged whale there,\\nI mean; aye, and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that\\nother precious fish he has there. Poor devil! I say, pass round a hat,\\nsome one, and let’s make him a present of a little oil for dear\\ncharity’s sake. For what oil he’ll get from that drugged whale there,\\nwouldn’t be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned cell. And as\\nfor the other whale, why, I’ll agree to get more oil by chopping up\\nand trying out these three masts of ours, than he’ll get from that\\nbundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it may contain\\nsomething worth a good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris. I\\nwonder now if our old man has thought of that. It’s worth trying.\\nYes, I’m for it;” and so saying he started for the quarter-deck.\\nBy this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that\\nwhether or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell,\\nwith no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing\\nfrom the cabin, Stubb now called his boat’s crew, and pulled off for\\nthe stranger. Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in\\naccordance with the fanciful French taste, the upper part of her\\nstem-piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was\\npainted green, and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it\\nhere and there; the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb\\nof a bright red colour. Upon her head boards, in large gilt letters, he\\nread “Bouton de Rose,”—Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the\\nromantic name of this aromatic ship.\\nThough Stubb did not understand the Bouton part of the\\ninscription, yet the word rose, and the bulbous figure-head put\\ntogether, sufficiently explained the whole to him.\\n“A wooden rose-bud, eh?” he cried with his hand to his nose,\\n“that will do very well; but how like all creation it smells!”\\nNow in order to hold direct communication with the people on\\ndeck, he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus\\ncome close to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.\\nArrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he\\nbawled—“Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-\\nRoses that speak English?”\\n“Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned\\nout to be the chief-mate.\\n“Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White\\nWhale?”\\n“What whale?”\\n“The White Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby Dick, have ye seen\\nhim?\\n“Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale—\\nno.”\\n“Very good, then; good bye now, and I’ll call again in a minute.”\\nThen rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab\\nleaning over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded\\nhis two hands into a trumpet and shouted—“No, Sir! No!” Upon\\nwhich Ahab retired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.\\nHe now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into\\nthe chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a\\nsort of bag.\\n“What’s the matter with your nose, there?” said Stubb. “Broke it?”\\n“I wish it was broken, or that I didn’t have any nose at all!”\\nanswered the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he\\nwas at very much. “But what are you holding yours for?”\\n“Oh, nothing! It’s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain’t\\nit? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will\\nye, Bouton-de-Rose?”\\n“What in the devil’s name do you want here?” roared the\\nGuernseyman, flying into a sudden passion.\\n“Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, that’s the word! why don’t you pack\\nthose whales in ice while you’re working at ’em? But joking aside,\\nthough; do you know, Rose-bud, that it’s all nonsense trying to get\\nany oil out of such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he\\nhasn’t a gill in his whole carcase.”\\n“I know that well enough; but, d’ye see, the Captain here won’t\\nbelieve it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer\\nbefore. But come aboard, and mayhap he’ll believe you, if he won’t\\nme; and so I’ll get out of this dirty scrape.”\\n“Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,” rejoined\\nStubb, and with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer\\nscene presented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted,\\nwere getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they\\nworked rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything\\nbut a good humor. All their noses upwardly projected from their\\nfaces like so many jib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would\\ndrop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air.\\nSome thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-\\ntar, and at intervals held it to their nostrils. Others having broken\\nthe stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were\\nvigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their\\nolfactories.\\nStubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas\\nproceeding from the Captain’s round-house abaft; and looking in\\nthat direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door, which\\nwas held ajar from within. This was the tormented surgeon, who,\\nafter in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had\\nbetaken himself to the Captain’s round-house (cabinet he called it)\\nto avoid the pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties\\nand indignations at times.\\nMarking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to\\nthe Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the\\nstranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a\\nconceited ignoramus, who had brought them all into so unsavory\\nand unprofitable a pickle. Sounding him carefully, Stubb further\\nperceived that the Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion\\nconcerning the ambergris. He therefore held his peace on that head,\\nbut otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the\\ntwo quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and\\nsatirizing the Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their\\nsincerity. According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man,\\nunder cover of an interpreter’s office, was to tell the Captain what\\nhe pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to\\nutter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the\\ninterview.\\nBy this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was\\na small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain,\\nwith large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton\\nvelvet vest with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb\\nwas now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once\\nostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them.\\n“What shall I say to him first?” said he.\\n“Why,” said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals,\\n“you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of\\nbabyish to me, though I don’t pretend to be a judge.”\\n“He says, Monsieur,” said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to\\nhis captain, “that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose\\ncaptain and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever\\ncaught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside.”\\nUpon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\\n“What now?” said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\\n“Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him\\ncarefully, I’m quite certain that he’s no more fit to command a\\nwhale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he’s a\\nbaboon.”\\n“He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried\\none, is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he\\nconjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.”\\nInstantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded\\nhis crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast\\nloose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.\\n“What now?” said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had\\nreturned to them.\\n“Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that—that—in\\nfact, tell him I’ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps\\nsomebody else.”\\n“He says, Monsieur, that he’s very happy to have been of any\\nservice to us.”\\nHearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful\\nparties (meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb\\ndown into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.\\n“He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,” said the\\ninterpreter.\\n“Thank him heartily; but tell him it’s against my principles to drink\\nwith the man I’ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.”\\n“He says, Monsieur, that his principles won’t admit of his drinking;\\nbut that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then\\nMonsieur had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from\\nthese whales, for it’s so calm they won’t drift.”\\nBy this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat,\\nhailed the Guernsey-man to this effect,—that having a long tow-line\\nin his boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out\\nthe lighter whale of the two from the ship’s side. While the\\nFrenchman’s boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way,\\nStubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way,\\nostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.\\nPresently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the\\nwhale; hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his\\ndistance, while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb’s whale.\\nWhereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing\\nthe Pequod to give notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to\\nreap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-\\nspade, he commenced an excavation in the body, a little behind the\\nside fin. You would almost have thought he was digging a cellar\\nthere in the sea; and when at length his spade struck against the\\ngaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried\\nin fat English loam. His boat’s crew were all in high excitement,\\neagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.\\nAnd all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\\nscreaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was\\nbeginning to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay\\nincreased, when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague,\\nthere stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide\\nof bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow\\ninto and then along with another, without at all blending with it for\\na time.\\n“I have it, I have it,” cried Stubb, with delight, striking something\\nin the subterranean regions, “a purse! a purse!”\\nDropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out\\nhandfuls of something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich\\nmottled old cheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might\\neasily dent it with your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and\\nash colour. And this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea\\nan ounce to any druggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but\\nmore was unavoidably lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might\\nhave been secured were it not for impatient Ahab’s loud command\\nto Stubb to desist, and come on board, else the ship would bid\\nthem good bye.\\nCHAPTER 92. Ambergris.\\nNow this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important\\nas an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born\\nCaptain Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of\\nCommons on that subject. For at that time, and indeed until a\\ncomparatively late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained,\\nlike amber itself, a problem to the learned. Though the word\\nambergris is but the French compound for grey amber, yet the two\\nsubstances are quite distinct. For amber, though at times found on\\nthe sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland soils, whereas\\nambergris is never found except upon the sea. Besides, amber is a\\nhard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces\\nto pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and\\nso highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in\\npastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and pomatum. The Turks\\nuse it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose\\nthat frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s in Rome. Some wine\\nmerchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.\\nWho would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen\\nshould regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious\\nbowels of a sick whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed\\nto be the cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the\\nwhale. How to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by\\nadministering three or four boat loads of Brandreth’s pills, and then\\nrunning out of harm’s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.\\nI have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,\\ncertain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might\\nbe sailors’ trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they\\nwere nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in\\nthat manner.\\nNow that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should\\nbe found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of\\nthat saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and\\nincorruption; how that we are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory.\\nAnd likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is\\nthat maketh the best musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of\\nall things of ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing\\nstages, is the worst.\\nI should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but\\ncannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against\\nwhalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased\\nminds, might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has\\nbeen said of the Frenchman’s two whales. Elsewhere in this volume\\nthe slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of\\nwhaling is throughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is\\nanother thing to rebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad.\\nNow how did this odious stigma originate?\\nI opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\\nGreenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago.\\nBecause those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out\\ntheir oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting\\nup the fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes\\nof large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of\\nthe season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to\\nwhich they are exposed, forbidding any other course. The\\nconsequence is, that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading\\none of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is\\ngiven forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old\\ncity grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in Hospital.\\nI partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may\\nbe likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in\\nformer times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or\\nSmeerenberg, which latter name is the one used by the learned\\nFogo Von Slack, in his great work on Smells, a text-book on that\\nsubject. As its name imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village\\nwas founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch\\nwhale fleet to be tried out, without being taken home to Holland\\nfor that purpose. It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil\\nsheds; and when the works were in full operation certainly gave\\nforth no very pleasant savor. But all this is quite different with a\\nSouth Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps,\\nafter completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps,\\nconsume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state\\nthat it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that living or\\ndead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means\\ncreatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the\\npeople of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company,\\nby the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than\\nfragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health;\\ntaking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,\\nseldom in the open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale’s\\nflukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented\\nlady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then shall I liken the\\nSperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude? Must it\\nnot be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent\\nwith myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to\\nAlexander the Great?\\nCHAPTER 93. The Castaway.\\nIt was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that\\na most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod’s\\ncrew; an event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the\\nsometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and\\never accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might\\nprove her own.\\nNow, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats.\\nSome few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it\\nis to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a\\ngeneral thing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men\\ncomprising the boats’ crews. But if there happen to be an unduly\\nslender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain\\nto be made a ship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the little\\nnegro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have\\nheard of him before; ye must remember his tambourine on that\\ndramatic midnight, so gloomy-jolly.\\nIn outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black\\npony and a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar\\ncolour, driven in one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy\\nwas by nature dull and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over\\ntender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with that pleasant,\\ngenial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy\\nall holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any other race.\\nFor blacks, the year’s calendar should show naught but three\\nhundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New Year’s Days. Nor\\nsmile so, while I write that this little black was brilliant, for even\\nblackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in\\nking’s cabinets. But Pip loved life, and all life’s peaceable securities;\\nso that the panic-striking business in which he had somehow\\nunaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his\\nbrightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus\\ntemporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly\\nillumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to\\nten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County\\nin Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler’s frolic on the\\ngreen; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned\\nthe round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in\\nthe clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the\\npure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the\\ncunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most\\nimpressive lustre, he lays it against a gloomy ground, and then\\nlights it up, not by the sun, but by some unnatural gases. Then\\ncome out those fiery effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-\\nblazing diamond, once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks\\nlike some crown-jewel stolen from the King of Hell. But let us to the\\nstory.\\nIt came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb’s after-oarsman\\nchanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite\\nmaimed; and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\\nThe first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much\\nnervousness; but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with\\nthe whale; and therefore came off not altogether discreditably;\\nthough Stubb observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to\\ncherish his courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it\\nneedful.\\nNow upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the\\nwhale; and as the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary\\nrap, which happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip’s\\nseat. The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to\\nleap, paddle in hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part\\nof the slack whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it\\noverboard with him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last\\nplumping into the water. That instant the stricken whale started on a\\nfierce run, the line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came\\nall foaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged\\nthere by the line, which had taken several turns around his chest\\nand neck.\\nTashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He\\nhated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,\\nhe suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards\\nStubb, exclaimed interrogatively, “Cut?” Meantime Pip’s blue, choked\\nface plainly looked, Do, for God’s sake! All passed in a flash. In less\\nthan half a minute, this entire thing happened.\\n“Damn him, cut!” roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip\\nwas saved.\\nSo soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was\\nassailed by yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting\\nthese irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,\\nbusiness-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;\\nand that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The\\nsubstance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except—but all the rest\\nwas indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, Stick\\nto the boat, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes\\nhappen when Leap from the boat, is still better. Moreover, as if\\nperceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious\\nadvice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump\\nin for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and concluded\\nwith a peremptory command, “Stick to the boat, Pip, or by the Lord,\\nI won’t pick you up if you jump; mind that. We can’t afford to lose\\nwhales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what\\nyou would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and don’t jump any\\nmore.” Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that though man\\nloved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which\\npropensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\\nBut we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It\\nwas under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but\\nthis time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale\\nstarted to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried\\ntraveller’s trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a\\nbeautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and\\nflatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater’s\\nskin hammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that\\nsea, Pip’s ebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife\\nwas lifted when he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb’s inexorable back\\nwas turned upon him; and the whale was winged. In three minutes,\\na whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out\\nfrom the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black\\nhead to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and\\nthe brightest.\\nNow, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\\npractised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the\\nawful lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self\\nin the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell\\nit? Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea—\\nmark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her\\nsides.\\nBut had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate?\\nNo; he did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in\\nhis wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course\\ncome up to Pip very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such\\nconsiderations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own\\ntimidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar\\ninstances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost\\ninvariably in the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the\\nsame ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies.\\nBut it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly\\nspying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase;\\nand Stubb’s boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so\\nintent upon his fish, that Pip’s ringed horizon began to expand\\naround him miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last\\nrescued him; but from that hour the little negro went about the\\ndeck an idiot; such, at least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly\\nkept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not\\ndrowned entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous\\ndepths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided\\nto and fro before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom,\\nrevealed his hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-\\njuvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent,\\ncoral insects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the\\ncolossal orbs. He saw God’s foot upon the treadle of the loom, and\\nspoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So man’s\\ninsanity is heaven’s sense; and wandering from all mortal reason,\\nman comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is\\nabsurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised,\\nindifferent as his God.\\nFor the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in\\nthat fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen\\nwhat like abandonment befell myself.\\nCHAPTER 94. A Squeeze of\\nthe Hand.\\nThat whale of Stubb’s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to\\nthe Pequod’s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations\\npreviously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling\\nof the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.\\nWhile some were occupied with this latter duty, others were\\nemployed in dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with\\nthe sperm; and when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was\\ncarefully manipulated ere going to the try-works, of which anon.\\nIt had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with\\nseveral others, I sat down before a large Constantine’s bath of it, I\\nfound it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling\\nabout in the liquid part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps\\nback into fluid. A sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old\\ntimes this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such\\na sweetener! such a softener! such a delicious molifier! After having\\nmy hands in it for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and\\nbegan, as it were, to serpentine and spiralise.\\nAs I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the\\nbitter exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship\\nunder indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my\\nhands among those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues,\\nwoven almost within the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers,\\nand discharged all their opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as\\nI snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma,—literally and truly, like the\\nsmell of spring violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in\\na musky meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that\\ninexpressible sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost\\nbegan to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare\\nvirtue in allaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt\\ndivinely free from all ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort\\nwhatsoever.\\nSqueeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that\\nsperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a\\nstrange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself\\nunwittingly squeezing my co-laborers’ hands in it, mistaking their\\nhands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate,\\nfriendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was\\ncontinually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes\\nsentimentally; as much as to say,—Oh! my dear fellow beings, why\\nshould we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest\\nill-humor or envy! Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us\\nall squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves\\nuniversally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.\\nWould that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now,\\nsince by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived\\nthat in all cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his\\nconceit of attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect\\nor the fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the\\nsaddle, the fireside, the country; now that I have perceived all this, I\\nam ready to squeeze case eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the\\nnight, I saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in\\na jar of spermaceti.\\nNow, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other\\nthings akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for\\nthe try-works.\\nFirst comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the\\ntapering part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his\\nflukes. It is tough with congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but\\nstill contains some oil. After being severed from the whale, the\\nwhite-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the\\nmincer. They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble.\\nPlum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary\\nparts of the whale’s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of\\nblubber, and often participating to a considerable degree in its\\nunctuousness. It is a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to\\nbehold. As its name imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled\\ntint, with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots\\nof the deepest crimson and purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures\\nof citron. Spite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I\\nconfess, that once I stole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted\\nsomething as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of\\nLouis le Gros might have tasted, supposing him to have been killed\\nthe first day after the venison season, and that particular venison\\nseason contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the\\nvineyards of Champagne.\\nThere is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns\\nup in the course of this business, but which I feel it to be very\\npuzzling adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an\\nappellation original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of\\nthe substance. It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently\\nfound in the tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and\\nsubsequent decanting. I hold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured\\nmembranes of the case, coalescing.\\nGurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen,\\nbut sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It\\ndesignates the dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the\\nback of the Greenland or right whale, and much of which covers the\\ndecks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.\\nNippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale’s\\nvocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A\\nwhaleman’s nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from\\nthe tapering part of Leviathan’s tail: it averages an inch in thickness,\\nand for the rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe.\\nEdgewise moved along the oily deck, it operates like a leathern\\nsquilgee; and by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along\\nwith it all impurities.\\nBut to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at\\nonce to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with\\nits inmates. This place has previously been mentioned as the\\nreceptacle for the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the\\nwhale. When the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this\\napartment is a scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night. On\\none side, lit by a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the\\nworkmen. They generally go in pairs,—a pike-and-gaffman and a\\nspade-man. The whaling-pike is similar to a frigate’s boarding-\\nweapon of the same name. The gaff is something like a boat-hook.\\nWith his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and\\nstrives to hold it from slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches\\nabout. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet itself,\\nperpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This\\nspade is sharp as hone can make it; the spademan’s feet are\\nshoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide\\naway from him, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of his own toes, or\\none of his assistants’, would you be very much astonished? Toes are\\nscarce among veteran blubber-room men.\\nCHAPTER 95. The Cassock.\\nHad you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of\\nthis post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward\\nnigh the windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned\\nwith no small curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you\\nwould have seen there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers.\\nNot the wondrous cistern in the whale’s huge head; not the prodigy\\nof his unhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail;\\nnone of these would so surprise you, as half a glimpse of that\\nunaccountable cone,—longer than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in\\ndiameter at the base, and jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of\\nQueequeg. And an idol, indeed, it is; or, rather, in old times, its\\nlikeness was. Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of\\nQueen Maachah in Judea; and for worshipping which, King Asa, her\\nson, did depose her, and destroyed the idol, and burnt it for an\\nabomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th\\nchapter of the First Book of Kings.\\nLook at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and\\nassisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the\\nmariners call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if\\nhe were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field.\\nExtending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically\\nto remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa. This\\ndone he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a\\ngood stretching, so as almost to double its diameter; and at last\\nhangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken\\ndown; when removing some three feet of it, towards the pointed\\nextremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other end,\\nhe lengthwise slips himself bodily into it. The mincer now stands\\nbefore you invested in the full canonicals of his calling. Immemorial\\nto all his order, this investiture alone will adequately protect him,\\nwhile employed in the peculiar functions of his office.\\nThat office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the\\npots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse,\\nplanted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub\\nbeneath it, into which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets\\nfrom a rapt orator’s desk. Arrayed in decent black; occupying a\\nconspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an\\narchbishopric, what a lad for a Pope were this mincer!*\\n*Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the\\nmates to the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work\\ninto as thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business\\nof boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity\\nconsiderably increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.\\nCHAPTER 96. The Try-Works.\\nBesides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly\\ndistinguished by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of\\nthe most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting\\nthe completed ship. It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were\\ntransported to her planks.\\nThe try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast,\\nthe most roomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a\\npeculiar strength, fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid\\nmass of brick and mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in\\nheight. The foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the\\nmasonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron\\nbracing it on all sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the\\nflanks it is cased with wood, and at top completely covered by a\\nlarge, sloping, battened hatchway. Removing this hatch we expose\\nthe great try-pots, two in number, and each of several barrels’\\ncapacity. When not in use, they are kept remarkably clean.\\nSometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand, till they\\nshine within like silver punch-bowls. During the night-watches some\\ncynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away\\nthere for a nap. While employed in polishing them—one man in\\neach pot, side by side—many confidential communications are\\ncarried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound\\nmathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the\\nPequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was\\nfirst indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all\\nbodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will\\ndescend from any point in precisely the same time.\\nRemoving the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare\\nmasonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths\\nof the furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are\\nfitted with heavy doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is\\nprevented from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a\\nshallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the\\nworks. By a tunnel inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept\\nreplenished with water as fast as it evaporates. There are no external\\nchimneys; they open direct from the rear wall. And here let us go\\nback for a moment.\\nIt was about nine o’clock at night that the Pequod’s try-works\\nwere first started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to\\noversee the business.\\n“All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the\\nworks.” This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting\\nhis shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it\\nsaid that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be\\nfed for a time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a\\nmeans of quick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being\\ntried out, the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters,\\nstill contains considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters\\nfeed the flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming\\nmisanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and\\nburns by his own body. Would that he consumed his own smoke!\\nfor his smoke is horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not\\nonly that, but you must live in it for the time. It has an unspeakable,\\nwild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of\\nfunereal pyres. It smells like the left wing of the day of judgment; it\\nis an argument for the pit.\\nBy midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from\\nthe carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild\\nocean darkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the\\nfierce flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues,\\nand illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed\\nGreek fire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly\\ncommissioned to some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-\\nfreighted brigs of the bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their\\nmidnight harbors, with broad sheets of flame for sails, bore down\\nupon the Turkish frigates, and folded them in conflagrations.\\nThe hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a\\nwide hearth in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean\\nshapes of the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship’s stokers.\\nWith huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber\\ninto the scalding pots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky\\nflames darted, curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet.\\nThe smoke rolled away in sullen heaps. To every pitch of the ship\\nthere was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to\\nleap into their faces. Opposite the mouth of the works, on the\\nfurther side of the wide wooden hearth, was the windlass. This\\nserved for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the watch, when not otherwise\\nemployed, looking into the red heat of the fire, till their eyes felt\\nscorched in their heads. Their tawny features, now all begrimed with\\nsmoke and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric\\nbrilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the\\ncapricious emblazonings of the works. As they narrated to each\\nother their unholy adventures, their tales of terror told in words of\\nmirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them, like\\nthe flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their front, the\\nharpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and\\ndippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the ship\\ngroaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and\\nfurther into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully\\nchamped the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her\\non all sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and\\nladen with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that\\nblackness of darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her\\nmonomaniac commander’s soul.\\nSo seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours\\nsilently guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for\\nthat interval, in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness,\\nthe madness, the ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the\\nfiend shapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire,\\nthese at last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to\\nyield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over\\nme at a midnight helm.\\nBut that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)\\nthing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was\\nhorribly conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller\\nsmote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum\\nof sails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were\\nopen; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and\\nmechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all this,\\nI could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed\\nbut a minute since I had been watching the card, by the steady\\nbinnacle lamp illuminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet\\ngloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness.\\nUppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing I\\nstood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing\\nfrom all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death,\\ncame over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with\\nthe crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted\\nway, inverted. My God! what is the matter with me? thought I. Lo! in\\nmy brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was fronting the\\nship’s stern, with my back to her prow and the compass. In an\\ninstant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up\\ninto the wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad and how\\ngrateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and\\nthe fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!\\nLook not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream\\nwith thy hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass;\\naccept the first hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial\\nfire, when its redness makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in\\nthe natural sun, the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils\\nin the forking flames, the morn will show in far other, at least\\ngentler, relief; the glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp—all\\nothers but liars!\\nNevertheless the sun hides not Virginia’s Dismal Swamp, nor\\nRome’s accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of\\nmiles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not\\nthe ocean, which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two\\nthirds of this earth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more\\nof joy than sorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be true—not\\ntrue, or undeveloped. With books the same. The truest of all men\\nwas the Man of Sorrows, and the truest of all books is Solomon’s,\\nand Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe. “All is vanity.”\\nALL. This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian Solomon’s\\nwisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and jails, and walks fast\\ncrossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than hell; calls\\nCowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men; and\\nthroughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing wise,\\nand therefore jolly;—not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb-\\nstones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably\\nwondrous Solomon.\\nBut even Solomon, he says, “the man that wandereth out of the\\nway of understanding shall remain” (i.e., even while living) “in the\\ncongregation of the dead.” Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it\\ninvert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a\\nwisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is\\na Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the\\nblackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in\\nthe sunny spaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that\\ngorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the\\nmountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even\\nthough they soar.\\nCHAPTER 97. The Lamp.\\nHad you descended from the Pequod’s try-works to the Pequod’s\\nforecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single\\nmoment you would have almost thought you were standing in\\nsome illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors. There\\nthey lay in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled\\nmuteness; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.\\nIn merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of\\nqueens. To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in\\ndarkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he\\nseeks the food of light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an\\nAladdin’s lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest\\nnight the ship’s black hull still houses an illumination.\\nSee with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of\\nlamps—often but old bottles and vials, though—to the copper\\ncooler at the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale\\nat a vat. He burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and,\\ntherefore, unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral\\ncontrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He\\ngoes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and\\ngenuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own\\nsupper of game.\\nCHAPTER 98. Stowing Down\\nand Clearing Up.\\nAlready has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off\\ndescried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery\\nmoors, and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then\\ntowed alongside and beheaded; and how (on the principle which\\nentitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the\\nbeheaded was killed) his great padded surtout becomes the\\nproperty of his executioner; how, in due time, he is condemned to\\nthe pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, his\\nspermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the fire;—but now\\nit remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the\\ndescription by rehearsing—singing, if I may—the romantic\\nproceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them\\ndown into the hold, where once again leviathan returns to his native\\nprofundities, sliding along beneath the surface as before; but, alas!\\nnever more to rise and blow.\\nWhile still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the six-\\nbarrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling this\\nway and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed\\nround and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously\\nscoot across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last\\nman-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops,\\nrap, rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, ex\\nofficio, every sailor is a cooper.\\nAt length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the\\ngreat hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown\\nopen, and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This\\ndone, the hatches are replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet\\nwalled up.\\nIn the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable\\nincidents in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream\\nwith freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous\\nmasses of the whale’s head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie\\nabout, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has\\nbesooted all the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with\\nunctuousness; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself; while\\non all hands the din is deafening.\\nBut a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in\\nthis self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-\\nworks, you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant\\nvessel, \\nwith \\na \\nmost \\nscrupulously \\nneat \\ncommander. \\nThe\\nunmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue.\\nThis is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after\\nwhat they call an affair of oil. Besides, from the ashes of the burned\\nscraps of the whale, a potent lye is readily made; and whenever any\\nadhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the\\nside, that lye quickly exterminates it. Hands go diligently along the\\nbulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their\\nfull tidiness. The soot is brushed from the lower rigging. All the\\nnumerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully\\ncleansed and put away. The great hatch is scrubbed and placed\\nupon the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of\\nsight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the\\ncombined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship’s\\ncompany, the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded,\\nthen the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions; shift\\nthemselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the immaculate\\ndeck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from out the\\ndaintiest Holland.\\nNow, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes,\\nand humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine\\ncambrics; propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the\\ntop; object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the\\nforecastle. To hint to such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and\\nblubber, were little short of audacity. They know not the thing you\\ndistantly allude to. Away, and bring us napkins!\\nBut mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men\\nintent on spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will\\nagain soil the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small\\ngrease-spot somewhere. Yes; and many is the time, when, after the\\nseverest uninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing\\nstraight through for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where\\nthey have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line,—they\\nonly step to the deck to carry vast chains, and heave the heavy\\nwindlass, and cut and slash, yea, and in their very sweatings to be\\nsmoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial\\nsun and the equatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all this, they\\nhave finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make a\\nspotless dairy room of it; many is the time the poor fellows, just\\nbuttoning the necks of their clean frocks, are startled by the cry of\\n“There she blows!” and away they fly to fight another whale, and go\\nthrough the whole weary thing again. Oh! my friends, but this is\\nman-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we mortals by long\\ntoilings extracted from this world’s vast bulk its small but valuable\\nsperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves from its\\ndefilements, and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the\\nsoul; hardly is this done, when—There she blows!—the ghost is\\nspouted up, and away we sail to fight some other world, and go\\nthrough young life’s old routine again.\\nOh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright Greece,\\ntwo thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed\\nwith thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage—and, foolish as I\\nam, taught thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!\\nCHAPTER 99. The Doubloon.\\nEre now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his\\nquarter-deck, taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and\\nmainmast; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration\\nit has not been added how that sometimes in these walks, when\\nmost plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in turn at each\\nspot, and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before\\nhim. When he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened\\non the pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin\\nwith the pointed intensity of his purpose; and when resuming his\\nwalk he again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same\\nriveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still\\nwore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain\\nwild longing, if not hopefulness.\\nBut one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be\\nnewly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on\\nit, as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for\\nhimself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk\\nin them. And some certain significance lurks in all things, else all\\nthings are little worth, and the round world itself but an empty\\ncipher, except to sell by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston,\\nto fill up some morass in the Milky Way.\\nNow this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere\\nout of the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over\\ngolden sands, the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And\\nthough now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the\\nverdigris of copper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate to any\\nfoulness, it still preserved its Quito glow. Nor, though placed\\namongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands,\\nand through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which\\nmight cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every sunrise\\nfound the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it was set apart\\nand sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their\\nsailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale’s\\ntalisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night,\\nwondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever\\nlive to spend it.\\nNow those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of\\nthe sun and tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes;\\nsun’s disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners\\nwaving, are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious\\ngold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing\\nglories, by passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.\\nIt so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most\\nwealthy example of these things. On its round border it bore the\\nletters, REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came\\nfrom a country planted in the middle of the world, and beneath the\\ngreat equator, and named after it; and it had been cast midway up\\nthe Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by\\nthose letters you saw the likeness of three Andes’ summits; from\\none a flame; a tower on another; on the third a crowing cock; while\\narching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the signs\\nall marked with their usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun\\nentering the equinoctial point at Libra.\\nBefore this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was\\nnow pausing.\\n“There’s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers,\\nand all other grand and lofty things; look here,—three peaks as\\nproud as Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is\\nAhab; the courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too,\\nis Ahab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the\\nrounder globe, which, like a magician’s glass, to each and every man\\nin turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small\\ngains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve\\nitself. Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see!\\naye, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months\\nbefore he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries! From storm to\\nstorm! So be it, then. Born in throes, ’tis fit that man should live in\\npains and die in pangs! So be it, then! Here’s stout stuff for woe to\\nwork on. So be it, then.”\\n“No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil’s claws must\\nhave left their mouldings there since yesterday,” murmured Starbuck\\nto himself, leaning against the bulwarks. “The old man seems to\\nread Belshazzar’s awful writing. I have never marked the coin\\ninspectingly. He goes below; let me read. A dark valley between\\nthree mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in\\nsome faint earthly symbol. So in this vale of Death, God girds us\\nround; and over all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines\\na beacon and a hope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale\\nshows her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our\\nglance half way, to cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if,\\nat midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we\\ngaze for him in vain! This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still\\nsadly to me. I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.”\\n“There now’s the old Mogul,” soliloquized Stubb by the try-works,\\n“he’s been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and\\nboth with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine\\nfathoms long. And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I\\nhave it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer’s Hook, I’d not look at it\\nvery long ere spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion,\\nI regard this as queer. I have seen doubloons before now in my\\nvoyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru,\\nyour doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons\\nof Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes,\\nand half joes, and quarter joes. What then should there be in this\\ndoubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful? By Golconda!\\nlet me read it once. Halloa! here’s signs and wonders truly! That,\\nnow, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what\\nmy almanac below calls ditto. I’ll get the almanac and as I have\\nheard devils can be raised with Daboll’s arithmetic, I’ll try my hand\\nat raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the\\nMassachusetts calendar. Here’s the book. Let’s see now. Signs and\\nwonders; and the sun, he’s always among ’em. Hem, hem, hem; here\\nthey are—here they go—all alive:—Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the\\nBull and Jimimi! here’s Gemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he\\nwheels among ’em. Aye, here on the coin he’s just crossing the\\nthreshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book!\\nyou lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places. You’ll\\ndo to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply\\nthe thoughts. That’s my small experience, so far as the\\nMassachusetts calendar, and Bowditch’s navigator, and Daboll’s\\narithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing\\nwonderful in signs, and significant in wonders! There’s a clue\\nsomewhere; wait a bit; hist—hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you,\\nDoubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter;\\nand now I’ll read it off, straight out of the book. Come, Almanack!\\nTo begin: there’s Aries, or the Ram—lecherous dog, he begets us;\\nthen, Taurus, or the Bull—he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini,\\nor the Twins—that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when\\nlo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from\\nVirtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path—he gives a few fierce\\nbites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the\\nVirgin! that’s our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye,\\nwhen pop comes Libra, or the Scales—happiness weighed and\\nfound wanting; and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we\\nsuddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we\\nare curing the wound, when whang come the arrows all round;\\nSagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself. As we pluck out the\\nshafts, stand aside! here’s the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the\\nGoat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when\\nAquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and\\ndrowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep.\\nThere’s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes\\nthrough it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty.\\nJollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow\\nhere, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly’s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon!\\nBut stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the try-works,\\nnow, and let’s hear what he’ll have to say. There; he’s before it; he’ll\\nout with something presently. So, so; he’s beginning.”\\n“I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever\\nraises a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what’s all\\nthis staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that’s true; and\\nat two cents the cigar, that’s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won’t\\nsmoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here’s nine\\nhundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy ’em out.”\\n“Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a\\nfoolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of\\nwiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman—the old\\nhearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea.\\nHe luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the\\nother side of the mast; why, there’s a horse-shoe nailed on that side;\\nand now he’s back again; what does that mean? Hark! he’s\\nmuttering—voice like an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and\\nlisten!”\\n“If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day,\\nwhen the sun stands in some one of these signs. I’ve studied signs,\\nand know their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by\\nthe old witch in Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then\\nbe? The horse-shoe sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold. And\\nwhat’s the horse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe sign—the\\nroaring and devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to\\nthink of thee.”\\n“There’s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men\\nin one kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequeg\\n—all tattooing—looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says\\nthe Cannibal? As I live he’s comparing notes; looking at his thigh\\nbone; thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I\\nsuppose, as the old women talk Surgeon’s Astronomy in the back\\ncountry. And by Jove, he’s found something there in the vicinity of\\nhis thigh—I guess it’s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don’t know\\nwhat to make of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off\\nsome king’s trowsers. But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil,\\nFedallah; tail coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his\\npumps as usual. What does he say, with that look of his? Ah, only\\nmakes a sign to the sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the\\ncoin—fire worshipper, depend upon it. Ho! more and more. This way\\ncomes Pip—poor boy! would he had died, or I; he’s half horrible to\\nme. He too has been watching all of these interpreters—myself\\nincluded—and look now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot\\nface. Stand away again and hear him. Hark!”\\n“I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”\\n“Upon my soul, he’s been studying Murray’s Grammar! Improving\\nhis mind, poor fellow! But what’s that he says now—hist!”\\n“I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”\\n“Why, he’s getting it by heart—hist! again.”\\n“I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”\\n“Well, that’s funny.”\\n“And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I’m a\\ncrow, especially when I stand a’top of this pine tree here. Caw! caw!\\ncaw! caw! caw! caw! Ain’t I a crow? And where’s the scare-crow?\\nThere he stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and\\ntwo more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket.”\\n“Wonder if he means me?—complimentary!—poor lad!—I could\\ngo hang myself. Any way, for the present, I’ll quit Pip’s vicinity. I can\\nstand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he’s too crazy-witty for\\nmy sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering.”\\n“Here’s the ship’s navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on\\nfire to unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and what’s the\\nconsequence? Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when\\naught’s nailed to the mast it’s a sign that things grow desperate. Ha,\\nha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he’ll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My\\nfather, in old Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found\\na silver ring grown over in it; some old darkey’s wedding ring. How\\ndid it get there? And so they’ll say in the resurrection, when they\\ncome to fish up this old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it,\\nwith bedded oysters for the shaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the\\nprecious, precious, gold! the green miser’ll hoard ye soon! Hish!\\nhish! God goes ’mong the worlds blackberrying. Cook! ho, cook!\\nand cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get\\nyour hoe-cake done!”\\nCHAPTER 100. Leg and Arm.\\nThe Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the\\nSamuel Enderby, of London.\\n“Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?”\\nSo cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,\\nbearing down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was\\nstanding in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to\\nthe stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat’s\\nbow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking\\nman, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that\\nhung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm\\nof this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a\\nhussar’s surcoat.\\n“Hast seen the White Whale?”\\n“See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden\\nit, he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a\\nwooden head like a mallet.\\n“Man my boat!” cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the\\noars near him—“Stand by to lower!”\\nIn less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his\\ncrew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the\\nstranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the\\nexcitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss\\nof his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea\\nbut his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy\\nmechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to\\nbe rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment’s warning.\\nNow, it is no very easy matter for anybody—except those who are\\nalmost hourly used to it, like whalemen—to clamber up a ship’s side\\nfrom a boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat\\nhigh up towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half\\nway down to the kelson. So, deprived of one leg, and the strange\\nship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly\\ninvention, Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy\\nlandsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height\\nhe could hardly hope to attain.\\nIt has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\\ncircumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\\nluckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And\\nin the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the\\ntwo officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\\nperpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards\\nhim a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did\\nnot seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too\\nmuch of a cripple to use their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness\\nonly lasted a minute, because the strange captain, observing at a\\nglance how affairs stood, cried out, “I see, I see!—avast heaving\\nthere! Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle.”\\nAs good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a\\nday or two previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the\\nmassive curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached\\nto the end. This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once\\ncomprehending it all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the\\nhook (it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an\\napple tree), and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the\\nsame time also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-\\nover-hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle. Soon he was\\ncarefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon\\nthe capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in\\nwelcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his\\nivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades)\\ncried out in his walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones\\ntogether!—an arm and a leg!—an arm that never can shrink, d’ye\\nsee; and a leg that never can run. Where did’st thou see the White\\nWhale?—how long ago?”\\n“The White Whale,” said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm\\ntowards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been\\na telescope; “there I saw him, on the Line, last season.”\\n“And he took that arm off, did he?” asked Ahab, now sliding down\\nfrom the capstan, and resting on the Englishman’s shoulder, as he\\ndid so.\\n“Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?”\\n“Spin me the yarn,” said Ahab; “how was it?”\\n“It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,”\\nbegan the Englishman. “I was ignorant of the White Whale at that\\ntime. Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and\\nmy boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was,\\ntoo, that went milling and milling round so, that my boat’s crew\\ncould only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale.\\nPresently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great\\nwhale, with a milky-white head and hump, all crows’ feet and\\nwrinkles.”\\n“It was he, it was he!” cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his\\nsuspended breath.\\n“And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”\\n“Aye, aye—they were mine—my irons,” cried Ahab, exultingly\\n—“but on!”\\n“Give me a chance, then,” said the Englishman, good-humoredly.\\n“Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump,\\nruns all afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my\\nfast-line!\\n“Aye, I see!—wanted to part it; free the fast-fish—an old trick—I\\nknow him.”\\n“How it was exactly,” continued the one-armed commander, “I do\\nnot know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there\\nsomehow; but we didn’t know it then; so that when we afterwards\\npulled on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead\\nof the other whale’s; that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing\\nhow matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was—the\\nnoblest and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life—I resolved to capture\\nhim, spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the\\nhap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to\\nmight draw (for I have a devil of a boat’s crew for a pull on a whale-\\nline); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate’s boat—Mr.\\nMounttop’s here (by the way, Captain—Mounttop; Mounttop—the\\ncaptain);—as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop’s boat, which,\\nd’ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and snatching\\nthe first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it. But, Lord,\\nlook you, sir—hearts and souls alive, man—the next instant, in a jiff,\\nI was blind as a bat—both eyes out—all befogged and bedeadened\\nwith black foam—the whale’s tail looming straight up out of it,\\nperpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple. No use sterning all,\\nthen; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding sun, all crown-\\njewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second iron, to toss it\\noverboard—down comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my boat\\nin two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes first, the white\\nhump backed through the wreck, as though it was all chips. We all\\nstruck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized hold of my\\nharpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that like a\\nsucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same\\ninstant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a\\nflash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me\\ncaught me here” (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); “yes,\\ncaught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell’s flames, I was\\nthinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb\\nript its way along the flesh—clear along the whole length of my arm\\n—came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;—and that gentleman\\nthere will tell you the rest (by the way, captain—Dr. Bunger, ship’s\\nsurgeon: Bunger, my lad,—the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your\\npart of the yarn.”\\nThe professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been\\nall the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to\\ndenote his gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly\\nround but sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock\\nor shirt, and patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his\\nattention between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-\\nbox held in the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the\\nivory limbs of the two crippled captains. But, at his superior’s\\nintroduction of him to Ahab, he politely bowed, and straightway\\nwent on to do his captain’s bidding.\\n“It was a shocking bad wound,” began the whale-surgeon; “and,\\ntaking my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy—”\\n“Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,” interrupted the one-\\narmed captain, addressing Ahab; “go on, boy.”\\n“Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the\\nblazing hot weather there on the Line. But it was no use—I did all I\\ncould; sat up with him nights; was very severe with him in the\\nmatter of diet—”\\n“Oh, very severe!” chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly\\naltering his voice, “Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till\\nhe couldn’t see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed,\\nhalf seas over, about three o’clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he\\nsat up with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great\\nwatcher, and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog,\\nlaugh out! why don’t ye? You know you’re a precious jolly rascal.)\\nBut, heave ahead, boy, I’d rather be killed by you than kept alive by\\nany other man.”\\n“My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir”—\\nsaid the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to\\nAhab—“is apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever\\nthings of that sort. But I may as well say—en passant, as the French\\nremark—that I myself—that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the\\nreverend clergy—am a strict total abstinence man; I never drink—”\\n“Water!” cried the captain; “he never drinks it; it’s a sort of fits to\\nhim; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on—go\\non with the arm story.”\\n“Yes, I may as well,” said the surgeon, coolly. “I was about\\nobserving, sir, before Captain Boomer’s facetious interruption, that\\nspite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting\\nworse and worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as\\nsurgeon ever saw; more than two feet and several inches long. I\\nmeasured it with the lead line. In short, it grew black; I knew what\\nwas threatened, and off it came. But I had no hand in shipping that\\nivory arm there; that thing is against all rule”—pointing at it with\\nthe marlingspike—“that is the captain’s work, not mine; he ordered\\nthe carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the\\nend, to knock some one’s brains out with, I suppose, as he tried\\nmine once. He flies into diabolical passions sometimes. Do ye see\\nthis dent, sir”—removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and\\nexposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the\\nslightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a wound\\n—“Well, the captain there will tell you how that came here; he\\nknows.”\\n“No, I don’t,” said the captain, “but his mother did; he was born\\nwith it. Oh, you solemn rogue, you—you Bunger! was there ever\\nsuch another Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die,\\nyou ought to die in pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to\\nfuture ages, you rascal.”\\n“What became of the White Whale?” now cried Ahab, who thus\\nfar had been impatiently listening to this by-play between the two\\nEnglishmen.\\n“Oh!” cried the one-armed captain, “oh, yes! Well; after he\\nsounded, we didn’t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before\\nhinted, I didn’t then know what whale it was that had served me\\nsuch a trick, till some time afterwards, when coming back to the\\nLine, we heard about Moby Dick—as some call him—and then I\\nknew it was he.”\\n“Did’st thou cross his wake again?”\\n“Twice.”\\n“But could not fasten?”\\n“Didn’t want to try to: ain’t one limb enough? What should I do\\nwithout this other arm? And I’m thinking Moby Dick doesn’t bite so\\nmuch as he swallows.”\\n“Well, then,” interrupted Bunger, “give him your left arm for bait to\\nget the right. Do you know, gentlemen”—very gravely and\\nmathematically bowing to each Captain in succession—“Do you\\nknow, gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so\\ninscrutably constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite\\nimpossible for him to completely digest even a man’s arm? And he\\nknows it too. So that what you take for the White Whale’s malice is\\nonly his awkwardness. For he never means to swallow a single limb;\\nhe only thinks to terrify by feints. But sometimes he is like the old\\njuggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making\\nbelieve swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him\\nin good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more;\\nwhen I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d’ye\\nsee. No possible way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully\\nincorporate it into his general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if\\nyou are quick enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm\\nfor the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other,\\nwhy in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale have another\\nchance at you shortly, that’s all.”\\n“No, thank ye, Bunger,” said the English Captain, “he’s welcome to\\nthe arm he has, since I can’t help it, and didn’t know him then; but\\nnot to another one. No more White Whales for me; I’ve lowered for\\nhim once, and that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in\\nkilling him, I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm\\nin him, but, hark ye, he’s best let alone; don’t you think so,\\nCaptain?”—glancing at the ivory leg.\\n“He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let\\nalone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He’s all a\\nmagnet! How long since thou saw’st him last? Which way heading?”\\n“Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend’s,” cried Bunger,\\nstoopingly walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing;\\n“this man’s blood—bring the thermometer!—it’s at the boiling point!\\n—his pulse makes these planks beat!—sir!”—taking a lancet from his\\npocket, and drawing near to Ahab’s arm.\\n“Avast!” roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks—“Man\\nthe boat! Which way heading?”\\n“Good God!” cried the English Captain, to whom the question was\\nput. “What’s the matter? He was heading east, I think.—Is your\\nCaptain crazy?” whispering Fedallah.\\nBut Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to\\ntake the boat’s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle\\ntowards him, commanded the ship’s sailors to stand by to lower.\\nIn a moment he was standing in the boat’s stern, and the Manilla\\nmen were springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed\\nhim. With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his\\nown, Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.\\nCHAPTER 101. The Decanter.\\nEre the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that\\nshe hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel\\nEnderby, merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling\\nhouse of Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman’s\\nopinion, comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors\\nand Bourbons, in point of real historical interest. How long, prior to\\nthe year of our Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in\\nexistence, my numerous fish-documents do not make plain; but in\\nthat year (1775) it fitted out the first English ships that ever\\nregularly hunted the Sperm Whale; though for some score of years\\nprevious (ever since 1726) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of\\nNantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued that\\nLeviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not elsewhere.\\nBe it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were the first\\namong mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm\\nWhale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the\\nwhole globe who so harpooned him.\\nIn 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,\\nand at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded\\nCape Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-\\nboat of any sort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful\\nand lucky one; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the\\nprecious sperm, the Amelia’s example was soon followed by other\\nships, English and American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale\\ngrounds of the Pacific were thrown open. But not content with this\\ngood deed, the indefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel\\nand all his Sons—how many, their mother only knows—and under\\ntheir immediate auspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the\\nBritish government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on\\na whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded by a\\nnaval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and did\\nsome service; how much does not appear. But this is not all. In\\n1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own,\\nto go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan. That ship—\\nwell called the “Syren”—made a noble experimental cruise; and it\\nwas thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became\\ngenerally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded\\nby a Captain Coffin, a Nantucketer.\\nAll honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists\\nto the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long\\nago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other\\nworld.\\nThe ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very\\nfast sailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at\\nmidnight somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip\\ndown in the forecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all\\ntrumps—every soul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly\\ndeath. And that fine gam I had—long, very long after old Ahab\\ntouched her planks with his ivory heel—it minds me of the noble,\\nsolid, Saxon hospitality of that ship; and may my parson forget me,\\nand the devil remember me, if I ever lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say\\nwe had flip? Yes, and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the\\nhour; and when the squall came (for it’s squally off there by\\nPatagonia), and all hands—visitors and all—were called to reef\\ntopsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other\\naloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets\\ninto the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling gale,\\na warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts did not\\ngo overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we\\nhad to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting\\ndown the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it\\nto my taste.\\nThe beef was fine—tough, but with body in it. They said it was\\nbull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for\\ncertain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but\\nsubstantial, symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I\\nfancied that you could feel them, and roll them about in you after\\nthey were swallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you\\nrisked their pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread—but\\nthat couldn’t be helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short,\\nthe bread contained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle\\nwas not very light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark\\ncorner when you ate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm,\\nconsidering the dimensions of the cook’s boilers, including his own\\nlive parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a\\njolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows\\nall, and capital from boot heels to hat-band.\\nBut why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some\\nother English whalers I know of—not all though—were such famous,\\nhospitable ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the\\ncan, and the joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking,\\nand laughing? I will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these\\nEnglish whalers is matter for historical research. Nor have I been at\\nall sparing of historical whale research, when it has seemed needed.\\nThe English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,\\nZealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still\\nextant in the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions,\\ntouching plenty to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English\\nmerchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler.\\nHence, in the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not\\nnormal and natural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore,\\nmust have some special origin, which is here pointed out, and will\\nbe still further elucidated.\\nDuring my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon\\nan ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I\\nknew must be about whalers. The title was, “Dan Coopman,”\\nwherefore I concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of\\nsome Amsterdam cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must\\ncarry its cooper. I was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it\\nwas the production of one “Fitz Swackhammer.” But my friend Dr.\\nSnodhead, a very learned man, professor of Low Dutch and High\\nGerman in the college of Santa Claus and St. Pott’s, to whom I\\nhanded the work for translation, giving him a box of sperm candles\\nfor his trouble—this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied the\\nbook, assured me that “Dan Coopman” did not mean “The Cooper,”\\nbut “The Merchant.” In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch\\nbook treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other\\nsubjects, contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery.\\nAnd in this chapter it was, headed, “Smeer,” or “Fat,” that I found a\\nlong detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail\\nof Dutch whalemen; from which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I\\ntranscribe the following:\\n400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of\\nstock fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800\\nfirkins of butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs.\\ncheese (probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800\\nbarrels of beer.\\nMost statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in\\nthe present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole\\npipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.\\nAt the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all\\nthis beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts\\nwere incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and\\nPlatonic application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary\\ntables of my own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc.,\\nconsumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient\\nGreenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery. In the first place, the\\namount of butter, and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, seems\\namazing. I impute it, though, to their naturally unctuous natures,\\nbeing rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation,\\nand especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar\\nSeas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the\\nconvivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.\\nThe quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as\\nthose polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer\\nof that climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch\\nwhalemen, including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen\\nsea, did not much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men\\nto each of their fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen\\nin all; therefore, I say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man,\\nfor a twelve weeks’ allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that\\n550 ankers of gin. Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so\\nfuddled as one might fancy them to have been, were the right sort\\nof men to stand up in a boat’s head, and take good aim at flying\\nwhales; this would seem somewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at\\nthem, and hit them too. But this was very far North, be it\\nremembered, where beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the\\nEquator, in our southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the\\nharpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and\\ngrievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.\\nBut no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch\\nwhalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the\\nEnglish whalers have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say\\nthey, when cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better\\nout of the world, get a good dinner out of it, at least. And this\\nempties the decanter.\\nCHAPTER 102. A Bower in the\\nArsacides.\\nHitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have\\nchiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and\\nin detail upon some few interior structural features. But to a large\\nand thorough sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now\\nto unbutton him still further, and untagging the points of his hose,\\nunbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of\\nthe joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in his\\nultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton.\\nBut how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the\\nfishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the\\nwhale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver\\nlectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the\\nwindlass, hold up a specimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself,\\nIshmael. Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for\\nexamination, as a cook dishes a roast-pig? Surely not. A veritable\\nwitness have you hitherto been, Ishmael; but have a care how you\\nseize the privilege of Jonah alone; the privilege of discoursing upon\\nthe joists and beams; the rafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-\\npinnings, making up the frame-work of leviathan; and belike of the\\ntallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and cheeseries in his bowels.\\nI confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very\\nfar beneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been\\nblessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I\\nbelonged to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to\\nthe deck for his poke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the\\nharpoons, and for the heads of the lances. Think you I let that\\nchance go, without using my boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and\\nbreaking the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub?\\nAnd as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in\\ntheir gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am\\nindebted to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of\\nthe Arsacides. For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to\\nthe trading-ship Dey of Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the\\nArsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa\\nat Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far distant from what our sailors\\ncalled Bamboo-Town, his capital.\\nAmong many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being\\ngifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had\\nbrought together in Pupella whatever rare things the more\\ningenious of his people could invent; chiefly carved woods of\\nwonderful devices, chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles,\\naromatic canoes; and all these distributed among whatever natural\\nwonders, the wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast\\nupon his shores.\\nChief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after\\nan unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded,\\nwith his head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted\\ndroopings seemed his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last\\nbeen stripped of its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become\\ndust dry in the sun, then the skeleton was carefully transported up\\nthe Pupella glen, where a grand temple of lordly palms now\\nsheltered it.\\nThe ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebræ were carved with\\nArsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests\\nkept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head\\nagain sent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough,\\nthe terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-\\nhung sword that so affrighted Damocles.\\nIt was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the\\nIcy Glen; the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap;\\nthe industrious earth beneath was as a weaver’s loom, with a\\ngorgeous carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the\\nwarp and woof, and the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with\\nall their laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the\\nmessage-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the\\nlacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving\\nthe unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!—pause!—\\none word!—whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck?\\nwherefore all these ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver!—stay thy\\nhand!—but one single word with thee! Nay—the shuttle flies—the\\nfigures float from forth the loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever\\nslides away. The weaver-god, he weaves; and by that weaving is he\\ndeafened, that he hears no mortal voice; and by that humming, we,\\ntoo, who look on the loom are deafened; and only when we escape\\nit shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it. For even\\nso it is in all material factories. The spoken words that are inaudible\\namong the flying spindles; those same words are plainly heard\\nwithout the walls, bursting from the opened casements. Thereby\\nhave villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in\\nall this din of the great world’s loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be\\noverheard afar.\\nNow, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood,\\nthe great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging—a gigantic idler!\\nYet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and\\nhummed around him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver;\\nhimself all woven over with the vines; every month assuming\\ngreener, fresher verdure; but himself a skeleton. Life folded Death;\\nDeath trellised Life; the grim god wived with youthful Life, and\\nbegat him curly-headed glories.\\nNow, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and\\nsaw the skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where\\nthe real jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a\\nchapel as an object of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that\\nthe priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and\\nfro I paced before this skeleton—brushed the vines aside—broke\\nthrough the ribs—and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered,\\neddied long amid its many winding, shaded colonnades and\\narbours. But soon my line was out; and following it back, I emerged\\nfrom the opening where I entered. I saw no living thing within;\\nnaught was there but bones.\\nCutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the\\nskeleton. From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me\\ntaking the altitude of the final rib, “How now!” they shouted; “Dar’st\\nthou measure this our god! That’s for us.” “Aye, priests—well, how\\nlong do ye make him, then?” But hereupon a fierce contest rose\\namong them, concerning feet and inches; they cracked each other’s\\nsconces with their yard-sticks—the great skull echoed—and seizing\\nthat lucky chance, I quickly concluded my own admeasurements.\\nThese admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first,\\nbe it recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied\\nmeasurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you\\ncan refer to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum,\\nthey tell me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that\\ncountry, where they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and\\nother whales. Likewise, I have heard that in the museum of\\nManchester, in New Hampshire, they have what the proprietors call\\n“the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the\\nUnited States.” Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton\\nConstable by name, a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his\\npossession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by\\nno means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo’s.\\nIn both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons\\nbelonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar\\ngrounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir\\nClifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir\\nClifford’s whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a great\\nchest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony cavities\\n—spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan—and swing all day upon his\\nlower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and\\nshutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch\\nof keys at his side. Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a\\npeep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence to\\nhear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the\\nunrivalled view from his forehead.\\nThe skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are\\ncopied verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as\\nin my wild wanderings at that period, there was no other secure\\nway of preserving such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for\\nspace, and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank\\npage for a poem I was then composing—at least, what untattooed\\nparts might remain—I did not trouble myself with the odd inches;\\nnor, indeed, should inches at all enter into a congenial\\nadmeasurement of the whale.\\nCHAPTER 103. Measurement\\nof The Whale’s Skeleton.\\nIn the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain\\nstatement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton\\nwe are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.\\nAccording to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly\\nbase upon Captain Scoresby’s estimate, of seventy tons for the\\nlargest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to\\nmy careful calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest\\nmagnitude, between eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and\\nsomething less than forty feet in its fullest circumference, such a\\nwhale will weigh at least ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen\\nmen to a ton, he would considerably outweigh the combined\\npopulation of a whole village of one thousand one hundred\\ninhabitants.\\nThink you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to\\nthis leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman’s\\nimagination?\\nHaving already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-\\nhole, jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall\\nnow simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of\\nhis unobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very\\nlarge a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far\\nthe most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated\\nconcerning it in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your\\nmind, or under your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not\\ngain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to\\nview.\\nIn length, the Sperm Whale’s skeleton at Tranque measured\\nseventy-two feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life,\\nhe must have been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton\\nloses about one fifth in length compared with the living body. Of\\nthis seventy-two feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet,\\nleaving some fifty feet of plain back-bone. Attached to this back-\\nbone, for something less than a third of its length, was the mighty\\ncircular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals.\\nTo me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\\nextending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\\nthe hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some\\ntwenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is\\notherwise, for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.\\nThe ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was\\nnearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\\nsuccessively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one of\\nthe middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From\\nthat part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only\\nspanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all\\nbore a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were\\nthe most arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams\\nwhereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams.\\nIn considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\\ncircumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton\\nof the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The\\nlargest of the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that\\npart of the fish which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest\\ndepth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been\\nat least sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but\\nlittle more than eight feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the\\ntrue notion of the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some\\nway, where I now saw but a naked spine, all that had been once\\nwrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and\\nbowels. Still more, for the ample fins, I here saw but a few\\ndisordered joints; and in place of the weighty and majestic, but\\nboneless flukes, an utter blank!\\nHow vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man\\nto try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring\\nover his dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood.\\nNo. Only in the heart of quickest perils; only when within the\\neddyings of his angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea,\\ncan the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out.\\nBut the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a\\ncrane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But\\nnow it’s done, it looks much like Pompey’s Pillar.\\nThere are forty and odd vertebræ in all, which in the skeleton are\\nnot locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks\\non a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The\\nlargest, a middle one, is in width something less than three feet,\\nand in depth more than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers\\naway into the tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something\\nlike a white billiard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones,\\nbut they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest’s\\nchildren, who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see\\nhow that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at\\nlast into simple child’s play.\\nCHAPTER 104. The Fossil\\nWhale.\\nFrom his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme\\nwhereon to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you,\\nyou could not compress him. By good rights he should only be\\ntreated of in imperial folio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from\\nspiracle to tail, and the yards he measures about the waist; only\\nthink of the gigantic involutions of his intestines, where they lie in\\nhim like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean\\norlop-deck of a line-of-battle-ship.\\nSince I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves\\nme to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not\\noverlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning\\nhim out to the uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already\\ndescribed him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical\\npeculiarities, it now remains to magnify him in an archæological,\\nfossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view. Applied to any other\\ncreature than the Leviathan—to an ant or a flea—such portly terms\\nmight justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when\\nLeviathan is the text, the case is altered. Fain am I to stagger to this\\nemprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary. And here be it\\nsaid, that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the\\ncourse of these dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto\\nedition of Johnson, expressly purchased for that purpose; because\\nthat famous lexicographer’s uncommon personal bulk more fitted\\nhim to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me.\\nOne often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,\\nthough it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me,\\nwriting of this Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands\\ninto placard capitals. Give me a condor’s quill! Give me Vesuvius’\\ncrater for an inkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of\\npenning my thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make\\nme faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if\\nto include the whole circle of the sciences, and all the generations\\nof whales, and men, and mastodons, past, present, and to come,\\nwith all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth, and\\nthroughout the whole universe, not excluding its suburbs. Such, and\\nso magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal theme! We expand\\nto its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty\\ntheme. No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the\\nflea, though many there be who have tried it.\\nEre entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my\\ncredentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I\\nhave been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals\\nand wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by\\nway of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the\\nearlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now\\nalmost completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what\\nare called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any\\nrate intercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and\\nthose whose remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all\\nthe Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period,\\nwhich is the last preceding the superficial formations. And though\\nnone of them precisely answer to any known species of the present\\ntime, they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects, to\\njustify their taking rank as Cetacean fossils.\\nDetached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their\\nbones and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various\\nintervals, been found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in\\nFrance, in England, in Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana,\\nMississippi, and Alabama. Among the more curious of such remains\\nis part of a skull, which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue\\nDauphine in Paris, a short street opening almost directly upon the\\npalace of the Tuileries; and bones disinterred in excavating the great\\ndocks of Antwerp, in Napoleon’s time. Cuvier pronounced these\\nfragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown Leviathanic\\nspecies.\\nBut by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the\\nalmost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the\\nyear 1842, on the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-\\nstricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one\\nof the fallen angels. The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile,\\nand bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen\\nbones of it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English\\nAnatomist, it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale,\\nthough of a departed species. A significant illustration of the fact,\\nagain and again repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the\\nwhale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested\\nbody. So Owen rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his\\npaper read before the London Geological Society, pronounced it, in\\nsubstance, one of the most extraordinary creatures which the\\nmutations of the globe have blotted out of existence.\\nWhen I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls,\\ntusks, jaws, ribs, and vertebræ, all characterized by partial\\nresemblances to the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the\\nsame time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the\\nannihilated antichronical Leviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am,\\nby a flood, borne back to that wondrous period, ere time itself can\\nbe said to have begun; for time began with man. Here Saturn’s grey\\nchaos rolls over me, and I obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into\\nthose Polar eternities; when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard\\nupon what are now the Tropics; and in all the 25,000 miles of this\\nworld’s circumference, not an inhabitable hand’s breadth of land was\\nvisible. Then the whole world was the whale’s; and, king of creation,\\nhe left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the\\nHimmalehs. Who can show a pedigree like Leviathan? Ahab’s\\nharpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh’s. Methuselah\\nseems a school-boy. I look round to shake hands with Shem. I am\\nhorror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the\\nunspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been before all\\ntime, must needs exist after all humane ages are over.\\nBut not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the\\nstereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed\\nhis ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems\\nto claim for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the\\nunmistakable print of his fin. In an apartment of the great temple of\\nDenderah, some fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the\\ngranite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in\\ncentaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures on\\nthe celestial globe of the moderns. Gliding among them, old\\nLeviathan swam as of yore; was there swimming in that planisphere,\\ncenturies before Solomon was cradled.\\nNor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the\\nantiquity of the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as\\nset down by the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.\\n“Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and\\nBeams of which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a\\nmonstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. The\\nCommon People imagine, that by a secret Power bestowed by God\\nupon the Temple, no Whale can pass it without immediate death.\\nBut the truth of the Matter is, that on either side of the Temple,\\nthere are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea, and wound the\\nWhales when they light upon ’em. They keep a Whale’s Rib of an\\nincredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon the Ground with its\\nconvex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which cannot\\nbe reached by a Man upon a Camel’s Back. This Rib (says John Leo)\\nis said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their\\nHistorians affirm, that a Prophet who prophesy’d of Mahomet, came\\nfrom this Temple, and some do not stand to assert, that the Prophet\\nJonas was cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Temple.”\\nIn this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be\\na Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.\\nCHAPTER 105. Does the\\nWhale’s Magnitude Diminish?\\n—Will He Perish?\\nInasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon\\nus from the head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired,\\nwhether, in the long course of his generations, he has not\\ndegenerated from the original bulk of his sires.\\nBut upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of\\nthe present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil\\nremains are found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct\\ngeological period prior to man), but of the whales found in that\\nTertiary system, those belonging to its latter formations exceed in\\nsize those of its earlier ones.\\nOf all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is\\nthe Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less\\nthan seventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have\\nalready seen, that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the\\nskeleton of a large sized modern whale. And I have heard, on\\nwhalemen’s authority, that Sperm Whales have been captured near a\\nhundred feet long at the time of capture.\\nBut may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are\\nan advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological\\nperiods; may it not be, that since Adam’s time they have\\ndegenerated?\\nAssuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts\\nof such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For\\nPliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and\\nAldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length\\n—Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days\\nof Banks and Solander, Cooke’s naturalists, we find a Danish\\nmember of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland\\nWhales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and\\ntwenty yards; that is, three hundred and sixty feet. And Lacépède,\\nthe French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in the very\\nbeginning of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one\\nhundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet. And this work\\nwas published so late as A.D. 1825.\\nBut will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-\\nday is as big as his ancestors in Pliny’s time. And if ever I go where\\nPliny is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell\\nhim so. Because I cannot understand how it is, that while the\\nEgyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even\\nPliny was born, do not measure so much in their coffins as a\\nmodern Kentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other\\nanimals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by\\nthe relative proportions in which they are drawn, just as plainly\\nprove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not\\nonly equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh’s fat\\nkine; in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the\\nwhale alone should have degenerated.\\nBut still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more\\nrecondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient\\nlook-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating\\neven through Behring’s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers\\nand lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances\\ndarted along all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether\\nLeviathan can long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a\\nhavoc; whether he must not at last be exterminated from the\\nwaters, and the last whale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe,\\nand then himself evaporate in the final puff.\\nComparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds\\nof buffalo, which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of\\nthousands the prairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron\\nmanes and scowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites\\nof populous river-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you\\nland at a dollar an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible\\nargument would seem furnished, to show that the hunted whale\\ncannot now escape speedy extinction.\\nBut you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a\\nperiod ago—not a good lifetime—the census of the buffalo in\\nIllinois exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at\\nthe present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that\\nregion; and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was\\nthe spear of man; yet the far different nature of the whale-hunt\\nperemptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan. Forty\\nmen in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for forty-eight months\\nthink they have done extremely well, and thank God, if at last they\\ncarry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the days of the old\\nCanadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West, when the far\\nwest (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness and a virgin,\\nthe same number of moccasined men, for the same number of\\nmonths, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have\\nslain not forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if\\nneed were, could be statistically stated.\\nNor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of\\nthe gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in\\nformer years (the latter part of the last century, say) these\\nLeviathans, in small pods, were encountered much oftener than at\\npresent, and, in consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged,\\nand were also much more remunerative. Because, as has been\\nelsewhere noticed, those whales, influenced by some views to safety,\\nnow swim the seas in immense caravans, so that to a large degree\\nthe scattered solitaries, yokes, and pods, and schools of other days\\nare now aggregated into vast but widely separated, unfrequent\\narmies. That is all. And equally fallacious seems the conceit, that\\nbecause the so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many\\ngrounds in former years abounding with them, hence that species\\nalso is declining. For they are only being driven from promontory to\\ncape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets, then,\\nbe sure, some other and remoter strand has been very recently\\nstartled by the unfamiliar spectacle.\\nFurthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they\\nhave two firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for\\never remain impregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys,\\nthe frosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from\\nthe savannas and glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales\\ncan at last resort to their Polar citadels, and diving under the\\nultimate glassy barriers and walls there, come up among icy fields\\nand floes; and in a charmed circle of everlasting December, bid\\ndefiance to all pursuit from man.\\nBut as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned\\nfor one cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have\\nconcluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously\\ndiminished their battalions. But though for some time past a\\nnumber of these whales, not less than 13,000, have been annually\\nslain on the nor’ west coast by the Americans alone; yet there are\\nconsiderations which render even this circumstance of little or no\\naccount as an opposing argument in this matter.\\nNatural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the\\npopulousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet\\nwhat shall we say to Harto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us\\nthat at one hunting the King of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in\\nthose regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the\\ntemperate climes. And there seems no reason to doubt that if these\\nelephants, which have now been hunted for thousands of years, by\\nSemiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive\\nmonarchs of the East—if they still survive there in great numbers,\\nmuch more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since he has a\\npasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as all Asia,\\nboth Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles of\\nthe sea combined.\\nMoreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great\\nlongevity of whales, their probably attaining the age of a century\\nand more, therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult\\ngenerations must be contemporary. And what that is, we may soon\\ngain some idea of, by imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and\\nfamily vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men,\\nwomen, and children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and\\nadding this countless host to the present human population of the\\nglobe.\\nWherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in\\nhis species, however perishable in his individuality. He swam the\\nseas before the continents broke water; he once swam over the site\\nof the Tuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noah’s\\nflood he despised Noah’s Ark; and if ever the world is to be again\\nflooded, like the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal\\nwhale will still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the\\nequatorial flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.\\nCHAPTER 106. Ahab’s Leg.\\nThe precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the\\nSamuel Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some\\nsmall violence to his own person. He had lighted with such energy\\nupon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half-\\nsplintering shock. And when after gaining his own deck, and his\\nown pivot-hole there, he so vehemently wheeled round with an\\nurgent command to the steersman (it was, as ever, something about\\nhis not steering inflexibly enough); then, the already shaken ivory\\nreceived such an additional twist and wrench, that though it still\\nremained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not\\ndeem it entirely trustworthy.\\nAnd, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his\\npervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to\\nthe condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it\\nhad not been very long prior to the Pequod’s sailing from\\nNantucket, that he had been found one night lying prone upon the\\nground, and insensible; by some unknown, and seemingly\\ninexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his ivory limb having been so\\nviolently displaced, that it had stake-wise smitten, and all but\\npierced his groin; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the\\nagonizing wound was entirely cured.\\nNor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that\\nall the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct\\nissue of a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the\\nmost poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as\\ninevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with\\nevery felicity, all miserable events do naturally beget their like. Yea,\\nmore than equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and\\nposterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy.\\nFor, not to hint of this: that it is an inference from certain canonic\\nteachings, that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no\\nchildren born to them for the other world, but, on the contrary, shall\\nbe followed by the joy-childlessness of all hell’s despair; whereas,\\nsome guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves\\nan eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave; not at\\nall to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in the deeper\\nanalysis of the thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest\\nearthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in\\nthem, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in\\nsome men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-\\nout not belie the obvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of\\nthese high mortal miseries, carries us at last among the sourceless\\nprimogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-\\nmaking suns, and soft cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must\\nneeds give in to this: that the gods themselves are not for ever\\nglad. The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the\\nstamp of sorrow in the signers.\\nUnwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might\\nmore properly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many\\nother particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery\\nto some, why it was, that for a certain period, both before and after\\nthe sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such\\nGrand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought\\nspeechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.\\nCaptain Peleg’s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means\\nadequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab’s deeper part, every\\nrevelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory\\nlight. But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at least.\\nThat direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness.\\nAnd not only this, but to that ever-contracting, dropping circle\\nashore, who, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a less\\nbanned approach to him; to that timid circle the above hinted\\ncasualty—remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab—\\ninvested itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the land of\\nspirits and of wails. So that, through their zeal for him, they had all\\nconspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this\\nthing from others; and hence it was, that not till a considerable\\ninterval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the Pequod’s decks.\\nBut be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the\\nair, or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or\\nnot with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took\\nplain practical procedures;—he called the carpenter.\\nAnd when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him\\nwithout delay set about making a new leg, and directed the mates\\nto see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm\\nWhale) which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage, in\\norder that a careful selection of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff\\nmight be secured. This done, the carpenter received orders to have\\nthe leg completed that night; and to provide all the fittings for it,\\nindependent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use.\\nMoreover, the ship’s forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its\\ntemporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate the affair, the\\nblacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of\\nwhatever iron contrivances might be needed.\\nCHAPTER 107. The Carpenter.\\nSeat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take\\nhigh abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and\\na woe. But from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the\\nmost part, they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both\\ncontemporary and hereditary. But most humble though he was, and\\nfar from furnishing an example of the high, humane abstraction; the\\nPequod’s carpenter was no duplicate; hence, he now comes in\\nperson on this stage.\\nLike all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those\\nbelonging to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed,\\npractical extent, alike experienced in numerous trades and callings\\ncollateral to his own; the carpenter’s pursuit being the ancient and\\noutbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or\\nless have to do with wood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the\\napplication to him of the generic remark above, this carpenter of\\nthe Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless\\nmechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a\\nthree or four years’ voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas. For\\nnot to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:—repairing stove\\nboats, sprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars,\\ninserting bull’s eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks,\\nand other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his\\nspecial business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all\\nmanner of conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.\\nThe one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so\\nmanifold, was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished\\nwith several vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood.\\nAt all times except when whales were alongside, this bench was\\nsecurely lashed athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.\\nA belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its\\nhole: the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and\\nstraightway files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage\\nstrays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of\\nright-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the\\ncarpenter makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprains\\nhis wrist: the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for\\nvermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar;\\nscrewing each oar in his big vice of wood, the carpenter\\nsymmetrically supplies the constellation. A sailor takes a fancy to\\nwear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears. Another has\\nthe toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand\\nupon his bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow\\nunmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling\\nround the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to\\nclap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.\\nThus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike\\nindifferent and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of\\nivory; heads he deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly\\nheld for capstans. But while now upon so wide a field thus variously\\naccomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all\\nthis would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence.\\nBut not precisely so. For nothing was this man more remarkable,\\nthan for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say;\\nfor it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it\\nseemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole\\nvisible world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes,\\nstill eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig\\nfoundations for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him,\\ninvolving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying heartlessness;—yet\\nwas it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like, antediluvian,\\nwheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a\\ncertain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served to pass the\\ntime during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah’s\\nark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long wanderer,\\nwhose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no moss; but\\nwhat is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings\\nmight have originally pertained to him? He was a stript abstract; an\\nunfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe; living\\nwithout premeditated reference to this world or the next. You might\\nalmost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a\\nsort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem\\nto work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had\\nbeen tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or\\nuneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal\\nprocess. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had\\none, must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers.\\nHe was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, multum\\nin parvo, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior—though a\\nlittle swelled—of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only\\nblades of various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers,\\nawls, pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors\\nwanted to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do\\nwas to open that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for\\ntweezers, take him up by the legs, and there they were.\\nYet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut\\ncarpenter, was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did\\nnot have a common soul in him, he had a subtle something that\\nsomehow anomalously did its duty. What that was, whether essence\\nof quicksilver, or a few drops of hartshorn, there is no telling. But\\nthere it was; and there it had abided for now some sixty years or\\nmore. And this it was, this same unaccountable, cunning life-\\nprinciple in him; this it was, that kept him a great part of the time\\nsoliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning wheel, which also\\nhummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his body was a sentry-box and\\nthis soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the time to keep\\nhimself awake.\\nCHAPTER 108. Ahab and the\\nCarpenter.\\nThe Deck—First Night Watch.\\n(Carpenter standing before his vice-bench, and by the light of two\\nlanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg, which joist is firmly\\nfixed in the vice. Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws, and\\nvarious tools of all sorts lying about the bench. Forward, the red\\nflame of the forge is seen, where the blacksmith is at work.)\\nDrat the file, and drat the bone! That is hard which should be\\nsoft, and that is soft which should be hard. So we go, who file old\\njaws and shinbones. Let’s try another. Aye, now, this works better\\n(sneezes). Halloa, this bone dust is (sneezes)—why it’s (sneezes)—\\nyes it’s (sneezes)—bless my soul, it won’t let me speak! This is what\\nan old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber. Saw a live tree,\\nand you don’t get this dust; amputate a live bone, and you don’t\\nget it (sneezes). Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a hand, and\\nlet’s have that ferule and buckle-screw; I’ll be ready for them\\npresently. Lucky now (sneezes) there’s no knee-joint to make; that\\nmight puzzle a little; but a mere shinbone—why it’s easy as making\\nhop-poles; only I should like to put a good finish on. Time, time; if I\\nbut only had the time, I could turn him out as neat a leg now as\\never (sneezes) scraped to a lady in a parlor. Those buckskin legs and\\ncalves of legs I’ve seen in shop windows wouldn’t compare at all.\\nThey soak water, they do; and of course get rheumatic, and have to\\nbe doctored (sneezes) with washes and lotions, just like live legs.\\nThere; before I saw it off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and\\nsee whether the length will be all right; too short, if anything, I\\nguess. Ha! that’s the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or it’s\\nsomebody else, that’s certain.\\nAHAB (advancing). (During the ensuing scene, the carpenter\\ncontinues sneezing at times.)\\nWell, manmaker!\\nJust in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length.\\nLet me measure, sir.\\nMeasured for a leg! good. Well, it’s not the first time. About it!\\nThere; keep thy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here,\\ncarpenter; let me feel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.\\nOh, sir, it will break bones—beware, beware!\\nNo fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery\\nworld that can hold, man. What’s Prometheus about there?—the\\nblacksmith, I mean—what’s he about?\\nHe must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.\\nRight. It’s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a\\nfierce red flame there!\\nAye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.\\nUm-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that\\nthat old Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have\\nbeen a blacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what’s made in\\nfire must properly belong to fire; and so hell’s probable. How the\\nsoot flies! This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans\\nof. Carpenter, when he’s through with that buckle, tell him to forge a\\npair of steel shoulder-blades; there’s a pedlar aboard with a crushing\\npack.\\nSir?\\nHold; while Prometheus is about it, I’ll order a complete man after\\na desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest\\nmodelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to ’em, to\\nstay in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart\\nat all, brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains;\\nand let me see—shall I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a\\nsky-light on top of his head to illuminate inwards. There, take the\\norder, and away.\\nNow, what’s he speaking about, and who’s he speaking to, I\\nshould like to know? Shall I keep standing here? (aside).\\n’Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here’s one.\\nNo, no, no; I must have a lantern.\\nHo, ho! That’s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.\\nWhat art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man?\\nThrusted light is worse than presented pistols.\\nI thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.\\nCarpenter? why that’s—but no;—a very tidy, and, I may say, an\\nextremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter;\\n—or would’st thou rather work in clay?\\nSir?—Clay? clay, sir? That’s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.\\nThe fellow’s impious! What art thou sneezing about?\\nBone is rather dusty, sir.\\nTake the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself\\nunder living people’s noses.\\nSir?—oh! ah!—I guess so;—yes—oh, dear!\\nLook ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good\\nworkmanlike workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well\\nfor thy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall\\nnevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that\\nis, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst\\nthou not drive that old Adam away?\\nTruly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard\\nsomething curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man\\nnever entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still\\npricking him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?\\nIt is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine\\nonce was; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two\\nto the soul. Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there,\\nthere to a hair, do I. Is’t a riddle?\\nI should humbly call it a poser, sir.\\nHist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking\\nthing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing\\nprecisely where thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy\\nspite? In thy most solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear\\neavesdroppers? Hold, don’t speak! And if I still feel the smart of my\\ncrushed leg, though it be now so long dissolved; then, why mayst\\nnot thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of hell for ever, and without\\na body? Hah!\\nGood Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over\\nagain; I think I didn’t carry a small figure, sir.\\nLook ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.—How long\\nbefore the leg is done?\\nPerhaps an hour, sir.\\nBungle away at it then, and bring it to me (turns to go). Oh, Life!\\nHere I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this\\nblockhead for a bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal inter-\\nindebtedness which will not do away with ledgers. I would be free\\nas air; and I’m down in the whole world’s books. I am so rich, I\\ncould have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Prætorians at the\\nauction of the Roman empire (which was the world’s); and yet I owe\\nfor the flesh in the tongue I brag with. By heavens! I’ll get a\\ncrucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down to one small,\\ncompendious vertebra. So.\\nCARPENTER (resuming his work).\\nWell, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always\\nsays he’s queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word\\nqueer; he’s queer, says Stubb; he’s queer—queer, queer; and keeps\\ndinning it into Mr. Starbuck all the time—queer—sir—queer, queer,\\nvery queer. And here’s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here’s his\\nbedfellow! has a stick of whale’s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his\\nleg; he’ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing\\nin three places, and all three places standing in one hell—how was\\nthat? Oh! I don’t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I’m a sort of\\nstrange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that’s only haphazard-\\nlike. Then, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to\\nwade out into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water\\nchucks you under the chin pretty quick, and there’s a great cry for\\nlife-boats. And here’s the heron’s leg! long and slim, sure enough!\\nNow, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must\\nbe because they use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady\\nuses her roly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he’s a hard driver.\\nLook, driven one leg to death, and spavined the other for life, and\\nnow wears out bone legs by the cord. Halloa, there, you Smut! bear\\na hand there with those screws, and let’s finish it before the\\nresurrection fellow comes a-calling with his horn for all legs, true or\\nfalse, as brewery-men go round collecting old beer barrels, to fill\\n’em up again. What a leg this is! It looks like a real live leg, filed\\ndown to nothing but the core; he’ll be standing on this to-morrow;\\nhe’ll be taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot the little oval\\nslate, smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude. So, so;\\nchisel, file, and sand-paper, now!\\nCHAPTER 109. Ahab and\\nStarbuck in the Cabin.\\nAccording to usage they were pumping the ship next morning;\\nand lo! no inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks\\nbelow must have sprung a bad leak. Much concern was shown; and\\nStarbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable\\naffair.*\\n*In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on\\nboard, it is a regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the\\nhold, and drench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at\\nvarying intervals, is removed by the ship’s pumps. Hereby the casks\\nare sought to be kept damply tight; while by the changed character\\nof the withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious\\nleakage in the precious cargo.\\nNow, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to\\nFormosa and the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the\\ntropical outlets from the China waters into the Pacific. And so\\nStarbuck found Ahab with a general chart of the oriental\\narchipelagoes spread before him; and another separate one\\nrepresenting the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islands—\\nNiphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke. With his snow-white new ivory leg\\nbraced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a long\\npruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man,\\nwith his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and\\ntracing his old courses again.\\n“Who’s there?” hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning\\nround to it. “On deck! Begone!”\\n“Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir.\\nWe must up Burtons and break out.”\\n“Up Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan;\\nheave-to here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?”\\n“Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may\\nmake good in a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get\\nis worth saving, sir.”\\n“So it is, so it is; if we get it.”\\n“I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.”\\n“And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it\\nleak! I’m all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky\\ncasks, but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that’s a far\\nworse plight than the Pequod’s, man. Yet I don’t stop to plug my\\nleak; for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to\\nplug it, even if found, in this life’s howling gale? Starbuck! I’ll not\\nhave the Burtons hoisted.”\\n“What will the owners say, sir?”\\n“Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the\\nTyphoons. What cares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always\\nprating to me, Starbuck, about those miserly owners, as if the\\nowners were my conscience. But look ye, the only real owner of\\nanything is its commander; and hark ye, my conscience is in this\\nship’s keel.—On deck!”\\n“Captain Ahab,” said the reddening mate, moving further into the\\ncabin, with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it\\nalmost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest\\noutward manifestation of itself, but within also seemed more than\\nhalf distrustful of itself; “A better man than I might well pass over in\\nthee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man; aye,\\nand in a happier, Captain Ahab.”\\n“Devils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me?\\n—On deck!”\\n“Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir—to be\\nforbearing! Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto,\\nCaptain Ahab?”\\nAhab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most\\nSouth-Sea-men’s cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,\\nexclaimed: “There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one\\nCaptain that is lord over the Pequod.—On deck!”\\nFor an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery\\ncheeks, you would have almost thought that he had really received\\nthe blaze of the levelled tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half\\ncalmly rose, and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and\\nsaid: “Thou hast outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask\\nthee not to beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let\\nAhab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man.”\\n“He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery\\nthat!” murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. “What’s that he\\nsaid—Ahab beware of Ahab—there’s something there!” Then\\nunconsciously using the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he\\npaced to and fro in the little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of\\nhis forehead relaxed, and returning the gun to the rack, he went to\\nthe deck.\\n“Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,” he said lowly to the\\nmate; then raising his voice to the crew: “Furl the t’gallant-sails, and\\nclose-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton,\\nand break out in the main-hold.”\\nIt were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as\\nrespecting Starbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of\\nhonesty in him; or mere prudential policy which, under the\\ncircumstance, imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open\\ndisaffection, however transient, in the important chief officer of his\\nship. However it was, his orders were executed; and the Burtons\\nwere hoisted.\\nCHAPTER 110. Queequeg in\\nHis Coffin.\\nUpon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the\\nhold were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So,\\nit being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing\\nthe slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black\\nmidnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above. So\\ndeep did they go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the\\naspect of the lowermost puncheons, that you almost looked next for\\nsome mouldy corner-stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah,\\nwith copies of the posted placards, vainly warning the infatuated old\\nworld from the flood. Tierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread,\\nand beef, and shooks of staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were\\nhoisted out, till at last the piled decks were hard to get about; and\\nthe hollow hull echoed under foot, as if you were treading over\\nempty catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-\\nfreighted demijohn. Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student\\nwith all Aristotle in his head. Well was it that the Typhoons did not\\nvisit them then.\\nNow, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast\\nbosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought\\nhim nigh to his endless end.\\nBe it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;\\ndignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the\\nhigher you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as\\nharpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale, but\\n—as we have elsewhere seen—mount his dead back in a rolling sea;\\nand finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly\\nsweating all day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely\\nmanhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage. To be\\nshort, among whalemen, the harpooneers are the holders, so called.\\nPoor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled,\\nyou should have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down\\nupon him there; where, stripped to his woollen drawers, the\\ntattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime,\\nlike a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well. And a well, or an\\nice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where, strange\\nto say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill\\nwhich lapsed into a fever; and at last, after some days’ suffering, laid\\nhim in his hammock, close to the very sill of the door of death. How\\nhe wasted and wasted away in those few long-lingering days, till\\nthere seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing. But\\nas all else in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his\\neyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of\\na strange softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you\\nthere from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that immortal\\nhealth in him which could not die, or be weakened. And like circles\\non the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes\\nseemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe\\nthat cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side\\nof this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any\\nbeheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is\\ntruly wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or\\nbooks. And the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike\\nimpresses all with a last revelation, which only an author from the\\ndead could adequately tell. So that—let us say it again—no dying\\nChaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose\\nmysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor\\nQueequeg, as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the\\nrolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest, and the\\nocean’s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and higher towards his\\ndestined heaven.\\nNot a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg\\nhimself, what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious\\nfavour he asked. He called one to him in the grey morning watch,\\nwhen the day was just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while\\nin Nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark\\nwood, like the rich war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he\\nhad learned that all whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in\\nthose same dark canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had\\nmuch pleased him; for it was not unlike the custom of his own race,\\nwho, after embalming a dead warrior, stretched him out in his\\ncanoe, and so left him to be floated away to the starry\\narchipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the stars are isles,\\nbut that far beyond all visible horizons, their own mild,\\nuncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form\\nthe white breakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at\\nthe thought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual\\nsea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring\\nsharks. No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more\\ncongenial to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these\\ncoffin-canoes were without a keel; though that involved but\\nuncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.\\nNow, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the\\ncarpenter was at once commanded to do Queequeg’s bidding,\\nwhatever it might include. There was some heathenish, coffin-\\ncoloured old lumber aboard, which, upon a long previous voyage,\\nhad been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands,\\nand from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be\\nmade. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order, than\\ntaking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of\\nhis character, proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg’s\\nmeasure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg’s person\\nas he shifted the rule.\\n“Ah! poor fellow! he’ll have to die now,” ejaculated the Long Island\\nsailor.\\nGoing to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and\\ngeneral reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact\\nlength the coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent\\nby cutting two notches at its extremities. This done, he marshalled\\nthe planks and his tools, and to work.\\nWhen the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted,\\nhe lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring\\nwhether they were ready for it yet in that direction.\\nOverhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the\\npeople on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every\\none’s consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly\\nbrought to him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all\\nmortals, some dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly,\\nsince they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor\\nfellows ought to be indulged.\\nLeaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin\\nwith an attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the\\nwooden stock drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in\\nthe coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own\\nrequest, also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a\\nflask of fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of\\nwoody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-\\ncloth being rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be\\nlifted into his final bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if\\nany it had. He lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to\\ngo to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo. Then crossing his\\narms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid\\n(hatch he called it) to be placed over him. The head part turned\\nover with a leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with\\nlittle but his composed countenance in view. “Rarmai” (it will do; it is\\neasy), he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his\\nhammock.\\nBut ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by\\nall this while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft\\nsobbings, took him by the hand; in the other, holding his\\ntambourine.\\n“Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving?\\nwhere go ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet\\nAntilles where the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do\\none little errand for me? Seek out one Pip, who’s now been missing\\nlong: I think he’s in those far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort\\nhim; for he must be very sad; for look! he’s left his tambourine\\nbehind;—I found it. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I’ll\\nbeat ye your dying march.”\\n“I have heard,” murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, “that\\nin violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues;\\nand that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in\\ntheir wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been\\nreally spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond\\nfaith, poor Pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings\\nheavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes. Where learned he\\nthat, but there?—Hark! he speaks again: but more wildly now.”\\n“Form two and two! Let’s make a General of him! Ho, where’s his\\nharpoon? Lay it across here.—Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a\\ngame cock now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies\\ngame!—mind ye that; Queequeg dies game!—take ye good heed of\\nthat; Queequeg dies game! I say; game, game, game! but base little\\nPip, he died a coward; died all a’shiver;—out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye\\nfind Pip, tell all the Antilles he’s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a\\ncoward! Tell them he jumped from a whale-boat! I’d never beat my\\ntambourine over base Pip, and hail him General, if he were once\\nmore dying here. No, no! shame upon all cowards—shame upon\\nthem! Let ’em go drown like Pip, that jumped from a whale-boat.\\nShame! shame!”\\nDuring all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream.\\nPip was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.\\nBut now that he had apparently made every preparation for\\ndeath; now that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg\\nsuddenly rallied; soon there seemed no need of the carpenter’s box:\\nand thereupon, when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in\\nsubstance, said, that the cause of his sudden convalescence was\\nthis;—at a critical moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore,\\nwhich he was leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind\\nabout dying: he could not die yet, he averred. They asked him, then,\\nwhether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and\\npleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word, it was Queequeg’s\\nconceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could\\nnot kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent,\\nungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.\\nNow, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and\\ncivilized; that while a sick, civilized man may be six months\\nconvalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well\\nagain in a day. So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and\\nat length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but\\neating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet,\\nthrew out his arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching,\\nyawned a little bit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted\\nboat, and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a fight.\\nWith a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest;\\nand emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order\\nthere. Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner\\nof grotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he\\nwas striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing\\non his body. And this tattooing had been the work of a departed\\nprophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks,\\nhad written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and\\nthe earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so\\nthat Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a\\nwondrous work in one volume; but whose mysteries not even\\nhimself could read, though his own live heart beat against them;\\nand these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder\\naway with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so\\nbe unsolved to the last. And this thought it must have been which\\nsuggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his, when one morning\\nturning away from surveying poor Queequeg—“Oh, devilish\\ntantalization of the gods!”\\nCHAPTER 111. The Pacific.\\nWhen gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the\\ngreat South Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted\\nmy dear Pacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long\\nsupplication of my youth was answered; that serene ocean rolled\\neastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue.\\nThere is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea,\\nwhose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul\\nbeneath; like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the\\nburied Evangelist St. John. And meet it is, that over these sea-\\npastures, wide-rolling watery prairies and Potters’ Fields of all four\\ncontinents, the waves should rise and fall, and ebb and flow\\nunceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades and shadows,\\ndrowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call lives and\\nsouls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in their\\nbeds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.\\nTo any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld,\\nmust ever after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost\\nwaters of the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its\\narms. The same waves wash the moles of the new-built Californian\\ntowns, but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men, and lave\\nthe faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than\\nAbraham; while all between float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-\\nlying, endless, unknown Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans.\\nThus this mysterious, divine Pacific zones the world’s whole bulk\\nabout; makes all coasts one bay to it; seems the tide-beating heart\\nof earth. Lifted by those eternal swells, you needs must own the\\nseductive god, bowing your head to Pan.\\nBut few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab’s brain, as standing like an\\niron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with\\none nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the\\nBashee isles (in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking),\\nand with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new\\nfound sea; that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then\\nbe swimming. Launched at length upon these almost final waters,\\nand gliding towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the old man’s\\npurpose intensified itself. His firm lips met like the lips of a vice; the\\nDelta of his forehead’s veins swelled like overladen brooks; in his\\nvery sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull, “Stern all!\\nthe White Whale spouts thick blood!”\\nCHAPTER 112. The\\nBlacksmith.\\nAvailing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now\\nreigned in these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly\\nactive pursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed,\\nblistered old blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the\\nhold again, after concluding his contributory work for Ahab’s leg,\\nbut still retained it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast;\\nbeing now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and\\nharpooneers, and bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering,\\nor repairing, or new shaping their various weapons and boat\\nfurniture. Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle, all\\nwaiting to be served; holding boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons,\\nand lances, and jealously watching his every sooty movement, as he\\ntoiled. Nevertheless, this old man’s was a patient hammer wielded\\nby a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did\\ncome from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over still further\\nhis chronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil were life itself,\\nand the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his\\nheart. And so it was.—Most miserable!\\nA peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful\\nappearing yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage\\nexcited the curiosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their\\npersisted questionings he had finally given in; and so it came to\\npass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched\\nfate.\\nBelated, and not innocently, one bitter winter’s midnight, on the\\nroad running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-\\nstupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought\\nrefuge in a leaning, dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the\\nextremities of both feet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at last\\ncame out the four acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as\\nyet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life’s drama.\\nHe was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had\\npostponedly encountered that thing in sorrow’s technicals called\\nruin. He had been an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to\\ndo; owned a house and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like,\\nloving wife, and three blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a\\ncheerful-looking church, planted in a grove. But one night, under\\ncover of darkness, and further concealed in a most cunning\\ndisguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his happy home, and\\nrobbed them all of everything. And darker yet to tell, the blacksmith\\nhimself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family’s heart. It\\nwas the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of that fatal cork, forth\\nflew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now, for prudent, most\\nwise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith’s shop was in the\\nbasement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so that\\nalways had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no\\nunhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout\\nringing of her young-armed old husband’s hammer; whose\\nreverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and walls,\\ncame up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout\\nLabor’s iron lullaby, the blacksmith’s infants were rocked to slumber.\\nOh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be\\ntimely? Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full\\nruin came upon him, then had the young widow had a delicious\\ngrief, and her orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of\\nin their after years; and all of them a care-killing competency. But\\nDeath plucked down some virtuous elder brother, on whose\\nwhistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other\\nfamily, and left the worse than useless old man standing, till the\\nhideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest.\\nWhy tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every\\nday grew more and more between; and each blow every day grew\\nfainter than the last; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless\\neyes, glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the\\nbellows fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold;\\nthe mother dived down into the long church-yard grass; her\\nchildren twice followed her thither; and the houseless, familyless old\\nman staggered off a vagabond in crape; his every woe\\nunreverenced; his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls!\\nDeath seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but\\nDeath is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it\\nis but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote,\\nthe Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing\\neyes of such men, who still have left in them some interior\\ncompunctions against suicide, does the all-contributed and all-\\nreceptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of\\nunimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures;\\nand from the hearts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing\\nto them—“Come hither, broken-hearted; here is another life without\\nthe guilt of intermediate death; here are wonders supernatural,\\nwithout dying for them. Come hither! bury thyself in a life which, to\\nyour now equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more\\noblivious than death. Come hither! put up thy gravestone, too,\\nwithin the churchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!”\\nHearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and\\nby fall of eve, the blacksmith’s soul responded, Aye, I come! And so\\nPerth went a-whaling.\\nCHAPTER 113. The Forge.\\nWith matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron,\\nabout mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the\\nlatter placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-\\nhead in the coals, and with the other at his forge’s lungs, when\\nCaptain Ahab came along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking\\nleathern bag. While yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab\\npaused; till at last, Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began\\nhammering it upon the anvil—the red mass sending off the sparks\\nin thick hovering flights, some of which flew close to Ahab.\\n“Are these thy Mother Carey’s chickens, Perth? they are always\\nflying in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;—look\\nhere, they burn; but thou—thou liv’st among them without a\\nscorch.”\\n“Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab,” answered Perth,\\nresting for a moment on his hammer; “I am past scorching; not\\neasily can’st thou scorch a scar.”\\n“Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely\\nwoeful to me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in\\nothers that is not mad. Thou should’st go mad, blacksmith; say, why\\ndost thou not go mad? How can’st thou endure without being mad?\\nDo the heavens yet hate thee, that thou can’st not go mad?—What\\nwert thou making there?”\\n“Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.”\\n“And can’st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such\\nhard usage as it had?”\\n“I think so, sir.”\\n“And I suppose thou can’st smoothe almost any seams and dents;\\nnever mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?”\\n“Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.”\\n“Look ye here, then,” cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and\\nleaning with both hands on Perth’s shoulders; “look ye here—here—\\ncan ye smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith,” sweeping one\\nhand across his ribbed brow; “if thou could’st, blacksmith, glad\\nenough would I lay my head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest\\nhammer between my eyes. Answer! Can’st thou smoothe this\\nseam?”\\n“Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?”\\n“Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for\\nthough thou only see’st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into\\nthe bone of my skull—that is all wrinkles! But, away with child’s play;\\nno more gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!” jingling the leathern\\nbag, as if it were full of gold coins. “I, too, want a harpoon made;\\none that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth; something\\nthat will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. There’s the stuff,”\\nflinging the pouch upon the anvil. “Look ye, blacksmith, these are\\nthe gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.”\\n“Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then,\\nthe best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.”\\n“I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from\\nthe melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And\\nforge me first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and\\nhammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-\\nline. Quick! I’ll blow the fire.”\\nWhen at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by\\none, by spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron\\nbolt. “A flaw!” rejecting the last one. “Work that over again, Perth.”\\nThis done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one,\\nwhen Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron.\\nAs, then, with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil,\\nPerth passing to him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the\\nhard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee\\npassed silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed\\ninvoking some curse or some blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab\\nlooked up, he slid aside.\\n“What’s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?” muttered\\nStubb, looking on from the forecastle. “That Parsee smells fire like a\\nfusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket’s powder-pan.”\\nAt last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and\\nas Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water\\nnear by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab’s bent face.\\n“Would’st thou brand me, Perth?” wincing for a moment with the\\npain; “have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?”\\n“Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this\\nharpoon for the White Whale?”\\n“For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make\\nthem thyself, man. Here are my razors—the best of steel; here, and\\nmake the barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.”\\nFor a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he\\nwould fain not use them.\\n“Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither\\nshave, sup, nor pray till—but here—to work!”\\nFashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to\\nthe shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the\\nblacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to\\ntempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.\\n“No, no—no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper.\\nAhoy, there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans!\\nWill ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb?” holding it\\nhigh up. A cluster of dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were\\nmade in the heathen flesh, and the White Whale’s barbs were then\\ntempered.\\n“Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!”\\ndeliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured\\nthe baptismal blood.\\nNow, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of\\nhickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the\\nsocket of the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and\\nsome fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great\\ntension. Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-\\nstring, then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab\\nexclaimed, “Good! and now for the seizings.”\\nAt one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate\\nspread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the\\nharpoon; the pole was then driven hard up into the socket; from the\\nlower end the rope was traced half-way along the pole’s length, and\\nfirmly secured so, with intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron,\\nand rope—like the Three Fates—remained inseparable, and Ahab\\nmoodily stalked away with the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg,\\nand the sound of the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along\\nevery plank. But ere he entered his cabin, light, unnatural, half-\\nbantering, yet most piteous sound was heard. Oh, Pip! thy wretched\\nlaugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy strange mummeries not\\nunmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship,\\nand mocked it!\\nCHAPTER 114. The Gilder.\\nPenetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese\\ncruising ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often,\\nin mild, pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty\\nhours on the stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily\\npulling, or sailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an interlude\\nof sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising; though\\nwith but small success for their pains.\\nAt such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth,\\nslow heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and\\nso sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-\\nstone cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of\\ndreamy quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy\\nof the ocean’s skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it;\\nand would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals\\na remorseless fang.\\nThese are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels\\na certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he\\nregards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing\\nonly the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through\\nhigh rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as\\nwhen the western emigrants’ horses only show their erected ears,\\nwhile their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing\\nverdure.\\nThe long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these\\nthere steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied\\nchildren lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time,\\nwhen the flowers of the woods are plucked. And all this mixes with\\nyour most mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting,\\ninterpenetrate, and form one seamless whole.\\nNor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least\\nas temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did\\nseem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his\\nbreath upon them prove but tarnishing.\\nOh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul;\\nin ye,—though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,\\n—in ye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover;\\nand for some few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life\\nimmortal on them. Would to God these blessed calms would last.\\nBut the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by warp and\\nwoof: calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm. There is no\\nsteady unretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through\\nfixed gradations, and at the last one pause:—through infancy’s\\nunconscious spell, boyhood’s thoughtless faith, adolescence’ doubt\\n(the common doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last\\nin manhood’s pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we\\ntrace the round again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs\\neternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more?\\nIn what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will never\\nweary? Where is the foundling’s father hidden? Our souls are like\\nthose orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the\\nsecret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn\\nit.\\nAnd that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat’s side into\\nthat same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:—\\n“Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride’s\\neye!—Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping\\ncannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look\\ndeep down and do believe.”\\nAnd Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same\\ngolden light:—\\n“I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes\\noaths that he has always been jolly!”\\nCHAPTER 115. The Pequod\\nMeets The Bachelor.\\nAnd jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came\\nbearing down before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab’s\\nharpoon had been welded.\\nIt was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in\\nher last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now,\\nin glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-\\ngloriously, sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the\\nground, previous to pointing her prow for home.\\nThe three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow\\nred bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was\\nsuspended, bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit\\nwas seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain.\\nSignals, ensigns, and jacks of all colours were flying from her\\nrigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of her three\\nbasketed tops were two barrels of sperm; above which, in her top-\\nmast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the same precious\\nfluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp.\\nAs was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most\\nsurprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in\\nthe same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months\\nwithout securing a single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and\\nbread been given away to make room for the far more valuable\\nsperm, but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for,\\nfrom the ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck,\\nand in the captain’s and officers’ state-rooms. Even the cabin table\\nitself had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess\\ndined off the broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor\\nfor a centrepiece. In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked\\nand pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added,\\nthat the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled it;\\nthat the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that\\nthe harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled\\nthem; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the\\ncaptain’s pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his\\nhands into, in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.\\nAs this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody\\nPequod, the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her\\nforecastle; and drawing still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen\\nstanding round her huge try-pots, which, covered with the\\nparchment-like poke or stomach skin of the black fish, gave forth a\\nloud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew. On the\\nquarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the\\nolive-hued girls who had eloped with them from the Polynesian\\nIsles; while suspended in an ornamented boat, firmly secured aloft\\nbetween the foremast and mainmast, three Long Island negroes,\\nwith glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were presiding over the\\nhilarious jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship’s company were\\ntumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works, from which the\\nhuge pots had been removed. You would have almost thought they\\nwere pulling down the cursed Bastille, such wild cries they raised, as\\nthe now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea.\\nLord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on\\nthe ship’s elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama\\nwas full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own\\nindividual diversion.\\nAnd Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and\\nblack, with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each\\nother’s wakes—one all jubilations for things passed, the other all\\nforebodings as to things to come—their two captains in themselves\\nimpersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene.\\n“Come aboard, come aboard!” cried the gay Bachelor’s\\ncommander, lifting a glass and a bottle in the air.\\n“Hast seen the White Whale?” gritted Ahab in reply.\\n“No; only heard of him; but don’t believe in him at all,” said the\\nother good-humoredly. “Come aboard!”\\n“Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?”\\n“Not enough to speak of—two islanders, that’s all;—but come\\naboard, old hearty, come along. I’ll soon take that black from your\\nbrow. Come along, will ye (merry’s the play); a full ship and\\nhomeward-bound.”\\n“How wondrous familiar is a fool!” muttered Ahab; then aloud,\\n“Thou art a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then,\\ncall me an empty ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I\\nwill mine. Forward there! Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!”\\nAnd thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the\\nother stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted;\\nthe crew of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances\\ntowards the receding Bachelor; but the Bachelor’s men never\\nheeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in. And as Ahab,\\nleaning over the taffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft, he took\\nfrom his pocket a small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship\\nto the vial, seemed thereby bringing two remote associations\\ntogether, for that vial was filled with Nantucket soundings.\\nCHAPTER 116. The Dying\\nWhale.\\nNot seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune’s\\nfavourites sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch\\nsomewhat of the rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails\\nfill out. So seemed it with the Pequod. For next day after\\nencountering the gay Bachelor, whales were seen and four were\\nslain; and one of them by Ahab.\\nIt was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the\\ncrimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and\\nsky, sun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness\\nand such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that\\nrosy air, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green\\nconvent valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze,\\nwantonly turned sailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper\\nhymns.\\nSoothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who\\nhad sterned off from the whale, sat intently watching his final\\nwanings from the now tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle\\nobservable in all sperm whales dying—the turning sunwards of the\\nhead, and so expiring—that strange spectacle, beheld of such a\\nplacid evening, somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness\\nunknown before.\\n“He turns and turns him to it,—how slowly, but how steadfastly,\\nhis homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying\\nmotions. He too worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal\\nof the sun!—Oh that these too-favouring eyes should see these\\ntoo-favouring sights. Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of\\nhuman weal or woe; in these most candid and impartial seas; where\\nto traditions no rocks furnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages,\\nthe billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars\\nthat shine upon the Niger’s unknown source; here, too, life dies\\nsunwards full of faith; but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls\\nround the corpse, and it heads some other way.\\n“Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast\\nbuilded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these\\nunverdured seas; thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly\\nspeakest to me in the wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed\\nburial of its after calm. Nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his\\ndying head, and then gone round again, without a lesson to me.\\n“Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring,\\nrainbowed jet!—that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In vain,\\noh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening sun,\\nthat only calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou, darker\\nhalf, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy unnamable\\nimminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of once\\nliving things, exhaled as air, but water now.\\n“Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild\\nfowl finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea;\\nthough hill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-\\nbrothers!”\\nCHAPTER 117. The Whale\\nWatch.\\nThe four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far\\nto windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern.\\nThese last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the\\nwindward one could not be reached till morning; and the boat that\\nhad killed it lay by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab’s.\\nThe waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale’s spout-hole;\\nand the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare\\nupon the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves,\\nwhich gently chafed the whale’s broad flank, like soft surf upon a\\nbeach.\\nAhab and all his boat’s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who\\ncrouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played\\nround the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails.\\nA sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of\\nunforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.\\nStarted from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and\\nhooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men\\nin a flooded world. “I have dreamed it again,” said he.\\n“Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor\\ncoffin can be thine?”\\n“And who are hearsed that die on the sea?”\\n“But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two\\nhearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made\\nby mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be\\ngrown in America.”\\n“Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:—a hearse and its plumes\\nfloating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha!\\nSuch a sight we shall not soon see.”\\n“Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.”\\n“And what was that saying about thyself?”\\n“Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.”\\n“And when thou art so gone before—if that ever befall—then ere\\nI can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?—Was it\\nnot so? Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here\\ntwo pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.”\\n“Take another pledge, old man,” said the Parsee, as his eyes\\nlighted up like fire-flies in the gloom—“Hemp only can kill thee.”\\n“The gallows, ye mean.—I am immortal then, on land and on sea,”\\ncried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;—“Immortal on land and on\\nsea!”\\nBoth were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and\\nthe slumbering crew arose from the boat’s bottom, and ere noon\\nthe dead whale was brought to the ship.\\nCHAPTER 118. The Quadrant.\\nThe season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when\\nAhab, coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant\\nhelmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager\\nmariners quickly run to the braces, and would stand there with all\\ntheir eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the\\norder to point the ship’s prow for the equator. In good time the\\norder came. It was hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the\\nbows of his high-hoisted boat, was about taking his wonted daily\\nobservation of the sun to determine his latitude.\\nNow, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of\\neffulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing\\nfocus of the glassy ocean’s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky\\nlooks lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this\\nnakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of\\nGod’s throne. Well that Ahab’s quadrant was furnished with coloured\\nglasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging\\nhis seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his astrological-\\nlooking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that posture\\nfor some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should\\ngain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention was\\nabsorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship’s deck,\\nand with face thrown up like Ahab’s, was eyeing the same sun with\\nhim; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild\\nface was subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the\\ndesired observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory\\nleg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise\\ninstant. Then falling into a moment’s revery, he again looked up\\ntowards the sun and murmured to himself: “Thou sea-mark! thou\\nhigh and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I am—but canst\\nthou cast the least hint where I shall be? Or canst thou tell where\\nsome other thing besides me is this moment living? Where is Moby\\nDick? This instant thou must be eyeing him. These eyes of mine\\nlook into the very eye that is even now beholding him; aye, and into\\nthe eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the\\nunknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!”\\nThen gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its\\nnumerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and\\nmuttered: “Foolish toy! babies’ plaything of haughty Admirals, and\\nCommodores, and Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning\\nand might; but what after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful\\npoint, where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and\\nthe hand that holds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell\\nwhere one drop of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow\\nnoon; and yet with thy impotence thou insultest the sun! Science!\\nCurse thee, thou vain toy; and cursed be all the things that cast\\nman’s eyes aloft to that heaven, whose live vividness but scorches\\nhim, as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light, O sun!\\nLevel by nature to this earth’s horizon are the glances of man’s eyes;\\nnot shot from the crown of his head, as if God had meant him to\\ngaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou quadrant!” dashing it to\\nthe deck, “no longer will I guide my earthly way by thee; the level\\nship’s compass, and the level dead-reckoning, by log and by line;\\nthese shall conduct me, and show me my place on the sea. Aye,”\\nlighting from the boat to the deck, “thus I trample on thee, thou\\npaltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and destroy\\nthee!”\\nAs the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live\\nand dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and\\na fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself—these passed\\nover the mute, motionless Parsee’s face. Unobserved he rose and\\nglided away; while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the\\nseamen clustered together on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly\\npacing the deck, shouted out—“To the braces! Up helm!—square\\nin!”\\nIn an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled\\nupon her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised\\nupon her long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting\\non one sufficient steed.\\nStanding between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the\\nPequod’s tumultuous way, and Ahab’s also, as he went lurching\\nalong the deck.\\n“I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full\\nof its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down,\\ndown, to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of\\nthine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!”\\n“Aye,” cried Stubb, “but sea-coal ashes—mind ye that, Mr. Starbuck\\n—sea-coal, not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab\\nmutter, ‘Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of\\nmine; swears that I must play them, and no others.’ And damn me,\\nAhab, but thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!”\\nCHAPTER 119. The Candles.\\nWarmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal\\ncrouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most\\neffulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows\\ntornadoes that never swept tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that\\nin these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the\\ndirest of all storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out\\nthat cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy\\ntown.\\nTowards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas,\\nand bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her\\ndirectly ahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and\\nsplit with the thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed\\nthe disabled masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the\\nfirst fury of the tempest had left for its after sport.\\nHolding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck;\\nat every flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional\\ndisaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb\\nand Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer\\nlashing of the boats. But all their pains seemed naught. Though\\nlifted to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat\\n(Ahab’s) did not escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against\\nthe reeling ship’s high teetering side, stove in the boat’s bottom at\\nthe stern, and left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.\\n“Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,” said Stubb, regarding the\\nwreck, “but the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can’t fight it.\\nYou see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it\\nleaps, all round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as\\nfor me, all the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here.\\nBut never mind; it’s all in fun: so the old song says;”—(sings.)\\n  Oh! jolly is the gale,\\n  And a joker is the whale,\\n  A’ flourishin’ his tail,—\\n  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!\\n  The scud all a flyin’,\\n  That’s his flip only foamin’;\\n  When he stirs in the spicin’,—\\n  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!\\n  Thunder splits the ships,\\n  But he only smacks his lips,\\n  A tastin’ of this flip,—\\n  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!\\n“Avast Stubb,” cried Starbuck, “let the Typhoon sing, and strike his\\nharp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold\\nthy peace.”\\n“But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a\\ncoward; and I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is,\\nMr. Starbuck, there’s no way to stop my singing in this world but to\\ncut my throat. And when that’s done, ten to one I sing ye the\\ndoxology for a wind-up.”\\n“Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.”\\n“What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else,\\nnever mind how foolish?”\\n“Here!” cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and\\npointing his hand towards the weather bow, “markest thou not that\\nthe gale comes from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run\\nfor Moby Dick? the very course he swung to this day noon? now\\nmark his boat there; where is that stove? In the stern-sheets, man;\\nwhere he is wont to stand—his stand-point is stove, man! Now\\njump overboard, and sing away, if thou must!\\n“I don’t half understand ye: what’s in the wind?”\\n“Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to\\nNantucket,” soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb’s\\nquestion. “The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can\\nturn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to\\nwindward, all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward—I\\nsee it lightens up there; but not with the lightning.”\\nAt that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness,\\nfollowing the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at\\nthe same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.\\n“Who’s there?”\\n“Old Thunder!” said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to\\nhis pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by\\nelbowed lances of fire.\\nNow, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry\\noff the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea\\nsome ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the\\nwater. But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth,\\nthat its end may avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if\\nkept constantly towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps,\\nbesides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and more\\nor less impeding the vessel’s way in the water; because of all this,\\nthe lower parts of a ship’s lightning-rods are not always overboard;\\nbut are generally made in long slender links, so as to be the more\\nreadily hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown down into the\\nsea, as occasion may require.\\n“The rods! the rods!” cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly\\nadmonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been\\ndarting flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. “Are they overboard?\\ndrop them over, fore and aft. Quick!”\\n“Avast!” cried Ahab; “let’s have fair play here, though we be the\\nweaker side. Yet I’ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and\\nAndes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let\\nthem be, sir.”\\n“Look aloft!” cried Starbuck. “The corpusants! the corpusants!”\\nAll the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at\\neach tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames,\\neach of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous\\nair, like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.\\n“Blast the boat! let it go!” cried Stubb at this instant, as a\\nswashing sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its\\ngunwale violently jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing.\\n“Blast it!”—but slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes\\ncaught the flames; and immediately shifting his tone he cried—“The\\ncorpusants have mercy on us all!”\\nTo sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the\\ntrance of the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will\\nimprecate curses from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter\\nover to a seething sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard\\na common oath when God’s burning finger has been laid on the\\nship; when His “Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin” has been woven into\\nthe shrouds and the cordage.\\nWhile this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard\\nfrom the enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the\\nforecastle, all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like\\na far away constellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light,\\nthe gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature,\\nand seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come. The\\nparted mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which\\nstrangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants;\\nwhile lit up by the preternatural light, Queequeg’s tattooing burned\\nlike Satanic blue flames on his body.\\nThe tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once\\nmore the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a\\npall. A moment or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward,\\npushed against some one. It was Stubb. “What thinkest thou now,\\nman; I heard thy cry; it was not the same in the song.”\\n“No, no, it wasn’t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and\\nI hope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?—\\nhave they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck—but it’s\\ntoo dark to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw\\nfor a sign of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is\\ngoing to be chock a’ block with sperm-oil, d’ye see; and so, all that\\nsperm will work up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three\\nmasts will yet be as three spermaceti candles—that’s the good\\npromise we saw.”\\nAt that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb’s face slowly\\nbeginning to glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: “See!\\nsee!” and once more the high tapering flames were beheld with\\nwhat seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor.\\n“The corpusants have mercy on us all,” cried Stubb, again.\\nAt the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the\\nflame, the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab’s front, but with his head\\nbowed away from him; while near by, from the arched and\\noverhanging rigging, where they had just been engaged securing a\\nspar, a number of the seamen, arrested by the glare, now cohered\\ntogether, and hung pendulous, like a knot of numbed wasps from a\\ndrooping, orchard twig. In various enchanted attitudes, like the\\nstanding, or stepping, or running skeletons in Herculaneum, others\\nremained rooted to the deck; but all their eyes upcast.\\n“Aye, aye, men!” cried Ahab. “Look up at it; mark it well; the white\\nflame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those\\nmainmast links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat\\nagainst it; blood against fire! So.”\\nThen turning—the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his\\nfoot upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung\\nright arm, he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of\\nflames.\\n“Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as\\nPersian once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by\\nthee, that to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear\\nspirit, and I now know that thy right worship is defiance. To neither\\nlove nor reverence wilt thou be kind; and e’en for hate thou canst\\nbut kill; and all are killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy\\nspeechless, placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake\\nlife will dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the\\nmidst of the personified impersonal, a personality stands here.\\nThough but a point at best; whencesoe’er I came; wheresoe’er I go;\\nyet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and feels\\nher royal rights. But war is pain, and hate is woe. Come in thy\\nlowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy\\nhighest, come as mere supernal power; and though thou launchest\\nnavies of full-freighted worlds, there’s that in here that still remains\\nindifferent. Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like\\na true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee.”\\n[Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap\\nlengthwise to thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes\\nhis eyes, his right hand pressed hard upon them.]\\n“I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it\\nwrung from me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind;\\nbut I can then grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes.\\nTake the homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not\\ntake it. The lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache\\nand ache; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling\\non some stunning ground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to\\nthee. Light though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am\\ndarkness leaping out of light, leaping out of thee! The javelins\\ncease; open eyes; see, or not? There burn the flames! Oh, thou\\nmagnanimous! now I do glory in my genealogy. But thou art but my\\nfiery father; my sweet mother, I know not. Oh, cruel! what hast thou\\ndone with her? There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater. Thou\\nknowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten;\\ncertainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun. I\\nknow that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou\\nomnipotent. There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou\\nclear spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness\\nmechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do\\ndimly see it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou\\ntoo hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here\\nagain with haughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the\\nsky! I leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with\\nthee; defyingly I worship thee!”\\n“The boat! the boat!” cried Starbuck, “look at thy boat, old man!”\\nAhab’s harpoon, the one forged at Perth’s fire, remained firmly\\nlashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his\\nwhale-boat’s bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused\\nthe loose leather sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb\\nthere now came a levelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent\\nharpoon burned there like a serpent’s tongue, Starbuck grasped\\nAhab by the arm—“God, God is against thee, old man; forbear! ’tis\\nan ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while\\nwe may, old man, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a\\nbetter voyage than this.”\\nOverhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the\\nbraces—though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the\\naghast mate’s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous\\ncry. But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and\\nsnatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among\\nthem; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a\\nrope’s end. Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the\\nfiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again\\nspoke:—\\n“All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine;\\nand heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And\\nthat ye may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I\\nblow out the last fear!” And with one blast of his breath he\\nextinguished the flame.\\nAs in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the\\nneighborhood of some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and\\nstrength but render it so much the more unsafe, because so much\\nthe more a mark for thunderbolts; so at those last words of Ahab’s\\nmany of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay.\\nCHAPTER 120. The Deck\\nTowards the End of the First\\nNight Watch.\\nAhab standing by the helm. Starbuck approaching him.\\n“We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is\\nworking loose and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?”\\n“Strike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I’d sway them up\\nnow.”\\n“Sir!—in God’s name!—sir?”\\n“Well.”\\n“The anchors are working, sir. Shall I get them inboard?”\\n“Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind\\nrises, but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to\\nit.—By masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper\\nof some coasting smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho,\\ngluepots! Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds, and this\\nbrain-truck of mine now sails amid the cloud-scud. Shall I strike\\nthat? Oh, none but cowards send down their brain-trucks in tempest\\ntime. What a hooroosh aloft there! I would e’en take it for sublime,\\ndid I not know that the colic is a noisy malady. Oh, take medicine,\\ntake medicine!”\\nCHAPTER 121. Midnight.—The\\nForecastle Bulwarks.\\nStubb and Flask mounted on them, and passing additional\\nlashings over the anchors there hanging.\\n“No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you\\nplease, but you will never pound into me what you were just now\\nsaying. And how long ago is it since you said the very contrary?\\nDidn’t you once say that whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship\\nshould pay something extra on its insurance policy, just as though it\\nwere loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward?\\nStop, now; didn’t you say so?”\\n“Well, suppose I did? What then? I’ve part changed my flesh since\\nthat time, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we are loaded with\\npowder barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the\\nlucifers get afire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man,\\nyou have pretty red hair, but you couldn’t get afire now. Shake\\nyourself; you’re Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill\\npitchers at your coat collar. Don’t you see, then, that for these extra\\nrisks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees? Here\\nare hydrants, Flask. But hark, again, and I’ll answer ye the other\\nthing. First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here,\\nthough, so I can pass the rope; now listen. What’s the mighty\\ndifference between holding a mast’s lightning-rod in the storm, and\\nstanding close by a mast that hasn’t got any lightning-rod at all in a\\nstorm? Don’t you see, you timber-head, that no harm can come to\\nthe holder of the rod, unless the mast is first struck? What are you\\ntalking about, then? Not one ship in a hundred carries rods, and\\nAhab,—aye, man, and all of us,—were in no more danger then, in\\nmy poor opinion, than all the crews in ten thousand ships now\\nsailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose you would have\\nevery man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running\\nup the corner of his hat, like a militia officer’s skewered feather, and\\ntrailing behind like his sash. Why don’t ye be sensible, Flask? it’s\\neasy to be sensible; why don’t ye, then? any man with half an eye\\ncan be sensible.”\\n“I don’t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.”\\n“Yes, when a fellow’s soaked through, it’s hard to be sensible,\\nthat’s a fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind;\\ncatch the turn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down\\nthese anchors now as if they were never going to be used again.\\nTying these two anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man’s hands\\nbehind him. And what big generous hands they are, to be sure.\\nThese are your iron fists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder,\\nFlask, whether the world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings\\nwith an uncommon long cable, though. There, hammer that knot\\ndown, and we’ve done. So; next to touching land, lighting on deck\\nis the most satisfactory. I say, just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye?\\nThank ye. They laugh at long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a\\nlong tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat. The\\ntails tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water, d’ye see.\\nSame with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs,\\nFlask. No more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I must mount\\na swallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so. Halloa! whew! there\\ngoes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord, Lord, that the winds that come\\nfrom heaven should be so unmannerly! This is a nasty night, lad.”\\nCHAPTER 122. Midnight Aloft.\\n—Thunder and Lightning.\\nThe main-top-sail yard.—Tashtego passing new lashings around it.\\n“Um, um, um. Stop that thunder! Plenty too much thunder up\\nhere. What’s the use of thunder? Um, um, um. We don’t want\\nthunder; we want rum; give us a glass of rum. Um, um, um!”\\nCHAPTER 123. The Musket.\\nDuring the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the\\nPequod’s jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to\\nthe deck by its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles\\nhad been attached to it—for they were slack—because some play to\\nthe tiller was indispensable.\\nIn a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed\\nshuttlecock to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the\\nneedles in the compasses, at intervals, go round and round. It was\\nthus with the Pequod’s; at almost every shock the helmsman had\\nnot failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved\\nupon the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without\\nsome sort of unwonted emotion.\\nSome hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that\\nthrough the strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb—one\\nengaged forward and the other aft—the shivered remnants of the\\njib and fore and main-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars, and\\nwent eddying away to leeward, like the feathers of an albatross,\\nwhich sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird\\nis on the wing.\\nThe three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and\\na storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went\\nthrough the water with some precision again; and the course—for\\nthe present, East-south-east—which he was to steer, if practicable,\\nwas once more given to the helmsman. For during the violence of\\nthe gale, he had only steered according to its vicissitudes. But as he\\nwas now bringing the ship as near her course as possible, watching\\nthe compass meanwhile, lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming\\nround astern; aye, the foul breeze became fair!\\nInstantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of “Ho! the\\nfair wind! oh-ye-ho, cheerly men!” the crew singing for joy, that so\\npromising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents\\npreceding it.\\nIn compliance with the standing order of his commander—to\\nreport immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any\\ndecided change in the affairs of the deck,—Starbuck had no sooner\\ntrimmed the yards to the breeze—however reluctantly and gloomily,\\n—than he mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the\\ncircumstance.\\nEre knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a\\nmoment. The cabin lamp—taking long swings this way and that—\\nwas burning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man’s\\nbolted door,—a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of\\nupper panels. The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a\\ncertain humming silence to reign there, though it was hooped\\nround by all the roar of the elements. The loaded muskets in the\\nrack were shiningly revealed, as they stood upright against the\\nforward bulkhead. Starbuck was an honest, upright man; but out of\\nStarbuck’s heart, at that instant when he saw the muskets, there\\nstrangely evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its neutral or\\ngood accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for\\nitself.\\n“He would have shot me once,” he murmured, “yes, there’s the\\nvery musket that he pointed at me;—that one with the studded\\nstock; let me touch it—lift it. Strange, that I, who have handled so\\nmany deadly lances, strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I\\nmust see. Aye, aye; and powder in the pan;—that’s not good. Best\\nspill it?—wait. I’ll cure myself of this. I’ll hold the musket boldly\\nwhile I think.—I come to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair\\nfor death and doom,—that’s fair for Moby Dick. It’s a fair wind that’s\\nonly fair for that accursed fish.—The very tube he pointed at me!—\\nthe very one; this one—I hold it here; he would have killed me with\\nthe very thing I handle now.—Aye and he would fain kill all his crew.\\nDoes he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale? Has he not\\ndashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same perilous seas,\\ngropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error-\\nabounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that he\\nwould have no lightning-rods? But shall this crazed old man be\\ntamely suffered to drag a whole ship’s company down to doom with\\nhim?—Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and\\nmore, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly\\nharm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way. If, then, he\\nwere this instant—put aside, that crime would not be his. Ha! is he\\nmuttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,—in there, he’s sleeping.\\nSleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I can’t withstand\\nthee, then, old man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not entreaty\\nwilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest. Flat obedience to thy\\nown flat commands, this is all thou breathest. Aye, and say’st the\\nmen have vow’d thy vow; say’st all of us are Ahabs. Great God\\nforbid!—But is there no other way? no lawful way?—Make him a\\nprisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this old man’s\\nliving power from his own living hands? Only a fool would try it. Say\\nhe were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers;\\nchained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more\\nhideous than a caged tiger, then. I could not endure the sight; could\\nnot possibly fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable\\nreason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage. What, then,\\nremains? The land is hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan\\nthe nearest. I stand alone here upon an open sea, with two oceans\\nand a whole continent between me and law.—Aye, aye, ’tis so.—Is\\nheaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be murderer\\nin his bed, tindering sheets and skin together?—And would I be a\\nmurderer, then, if”—and slowly, stealthily, and half sideways looking,\\nhe placed the loaded musket’s end against the door.\\n“On this level, Ahab’s hammock swings within; his head this way.\\nA touch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.\\n—Oh Mary! Mary!—boy! boy! boy!—But if I wake thee not to death,\\nold man, who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck’s body\\nthis day week may sink, with all the crew! Great God, where art\\nThou? Shall I? shall I?—The wind has gone down and shifted, sir;\\nthe fore and main topsails are reefed and set; she heads her course.”\\n“Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!”\\nSuch were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old\\nman’s tormented sleep, as if Starbuck’s voice had caused the long\\ndumb dream to speak.\\nThe yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard’s arm against the\\npanel; Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from\\nthe door, he placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.\\n“He’s too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him,\\nand tell him. I must see to the deck here. Thou know’st what to say.”\\nCHAPTER 124. The Needle.\\nNext morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows\\nof mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod’s gurgling track, pushed\\nher on like giants’ palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze\\nabounded so, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the\\nwhole world boomed before the wind. Muffled in the full morning\\nlight, the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his\\nplace; where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as\\nof crowned Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything.\\nThe sea was as a crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with\\nlight and heat.\\nLong maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and\\nevery time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit,\\nhe turned to eye the bright sun’s rays produced ahead; and when\\nshe profoundly settled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the\\nsun’s rearward place, and how the same yellow rays were blending\\nwith his undeviating wake.\\n“Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-\\nchariot of the sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the\\nsun to ye! Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the\\nsea!”\\nBut suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried\\ntowards the helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.\\n“East-sou-east, sir,” said the frightened steersman.\\n“Thou liest!” smiting him with his clenched fist. “Heading East at\\nthis hour in the morning, and the sun astern?”\\nUpon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just\\nthen observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else;\\nbut its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause.\\nThrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one\\nglimpse of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment\\nhe almost seemed to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked,\\nand lo! the two compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as\\ninfallibly going West.\\nBut ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew,\\nthe old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, “I have it! It has\\nhappened before. Mr. Starbuck, last night’s thunder turned our\\ncompasses—that’s all. Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I\\ntake it.”\\n“Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,” said the pale\\nmate, gloomily.\\nHere, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more\\nthan one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic\\nenergy, as developed in the mariner’s needle, is, as all know,\\nessentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not\\nto be much marvelled at, that such things should be. Instances\\nwhere the lightning has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite\\ndown some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon the needle has\\nat times been still more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being\\nannihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use\\nthan an old wife’s knitting needle. But in either case, the needle\\nnever again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost;\\nand if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate reaches all\\nthe others that may be in the ship; even were the lowermost one\\ninserted into the kelson.\\nDeliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the\\ntranspointed compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his\\nextended hand, now took the precise bearing of the sun, and\\nsatisfied that the needles were exactly inverted, shouted out his\\norders for the ship’s course to be changed accordingly. The yards\\nwere hard up; and once more the Pequod thrust her undaunted\\nbows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair one had only\\nbeen juggling her.\\nMeanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said\\nnothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and\\nFlask—who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his\\nfeelings—likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men,\\nthough some of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater\\nthan their fear of Fate. But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers\\nremained almost wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only\\nwith a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from\\ninflexible Ahab’s.\\nFor a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But\\nchancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper\\nsight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the\\ndeck.\\n“Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun’s pilot! yesterday I\\nwrecked thee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked\\nme. So, so. But Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr.\\nStarbuck—a lance without a pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of\\nthe sail-maker’s needles. Quick!”\\nAccessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now\\nabout to do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might\\nhave been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile\\nskill, in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses.\\nBesides, the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed\\nneedles, though clumsily practicable, was not a thing to be passed\\nover by superstitious sailors, without some shudderings and evil\\nportents.\\n“Men,” said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate\\nhanded him the things he had demanded, “my men, the thunder\\nturned old Ahab’s needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can\\nmake one of his own, that will point as true as any.”\\nAbashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors,\\nas this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever\\nmagic might follow. But Starbuck looked away.\\nWith a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head\\nof the lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod\\nremaining, bade him hold it upright, without its touching the deck.\\nThen, with the maul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this\\niron rod, he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and\\nless strongly hammered that, several times, the mate still holding\\nthe rod as before. Then going through some small strange motions\\nwith it—whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or\\nmerely intended to augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain—he\\ncalled for linen thread; and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the\\ntwo reversed needles there, and horizontally suspended the sail-\\nneedle by its middle, over one of the compass-cards. At first, the\\nsteel went round and round, quivering and vibrating at either end;\\nbut at last it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently\\nwatching for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and\\npointing his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,—“Look ye, for\\nyourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone! The sun is\\nEast, and that compass swears it!”\\nOne after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes\\ncould persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they\\nslunk away.\\nIn his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all\\nhis fatal pride.\\nCHAPTER 125. The Log and\\nLine.\\nWhile now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage,\\nthe log and line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a\\nconfident reliance upon other means of determining the vessel’s\\nplace, some merchantmen, and many whalemen, especially when\\ncruising, wholly neglect to heave the log; though at the same time,\\nand frequently more for form’s sake than anything else, regularly\\nputting down upon the customary slate the course steered by the\\nship, as well as the presumed average rate of progression every\\nhour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden reel and\\nangular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the railing\\nof the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and wind\\nhad warped it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that\\nhung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he\\nhappened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the\\nmagnet scene, and he remembered how his quadrant was no more,\\nand recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line. The ship\\nwas sailing plungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.\\n“Forward, there! Heave the log!”\\nTwo seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly\\nManxman. “Take the reel, one of ye, I’ll heave.”\\nThey went towards the extreme stern, on the ship’s lee side, where\\nthe deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost\\ndipping into the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.\\nThe Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the\\nprojecting handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line\\nrevolved, so stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till\\nAhab advanced to him.\\nAhab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or\\nforty turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when\\nthe old Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line,\\nmade bold to speak.\\n“Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have\\nspoiled it.”\\n“’Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled\\nthee? Thou seem’st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not\\nthou it.”\\n“I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey\\nhairs of mine ’tis not worth while disputing, ’specially with a\\nsuperior, who’ll ne’er confess.”\\n“What’s that? There now’s a patched professor in Queen Nature’s\\ngranite-founded College; but methinks he’s too subservient. Where\\nwert thou born?”\\n“In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.”\\n“Excellent! Thou’st hit the world by that.”\\n“I know not, sir, but I was born there.”\\n“In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it’s good. Here’s a\\nman from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now\\nunmanned of Man; which is sucked in—by what? Up with the reel!\\nThe dead, blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.”\\nThe log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a\\nlong dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to\\nwhirl. In turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the\\ntowing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger\\nstrangely.\\n“Hold hard!”\\nSnap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the\\ntugging log was gone.\\n“I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the\\nmad sea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here,\\nTahitian; reel up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make\\nanother log, and mend thou the line. See to it.”\\n“There he goes now; to him nothing’s happened; but to me, the\\nskewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in,\\nhaul in, Tahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in\\nbroken, and dragging slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?”\\n“Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip’s\\nmissing. Let’s see now if ye haven’t fished him up here, fisherman. It\\ndrags hard; I guess he’s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we\\nhaul in no cowards here. Ho! there’s his arm just breaking water. A\\nhatchet! a hatchet! cut it off—we haul in no cowards here. Captain\\nAhab! sir, sir! here’s Pip, trying to get on board again.”\\n“Peace, thou crazy loon,” cried the Manxman, seizing him by the\\narm. “Away from the quarter-deck!”\\n“The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,” muttered Ahab,\\nadvancing. “Hands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip\\nwas, boy?\\n“Astern there, sir, astern! Lo! lo!”\\n“And who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant\\npupils of thy eyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for\\nimmortal souls to sieve through! Who art thou, boy?”\\n“Bell-boy, sir; ship’s-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip! One\\nhundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high—looks\\ncowardly—quickest known by that! Ding, dong, ding! Who’s seen\\nPip the coward?”\\n“There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen\\nheavens! look down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have\\nabandoned him, ye creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahab’s cabin shall\\nbe Pip’s home henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my\\ninmost centre, boy; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my\\nheart-strings. Come, let’s down.”\\n“What’s this? here’s velvet shark-skin,” intently gazing at Ahab’s\\nhand, and feeling it. “Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing\\nas this, perhaps he had ne’er been lost! This seems to me, sir, as a\\nman-rope; something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old\\nPerth now come and rivet these two hands together; the black one\\nwith the white, for I will not let this go.”\\n“Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to\\nworse horrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye\\nbelievers in gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the\\nomniscient gods oblivious of suffering man; and man, though\\nidiotic, and knowing not what he does, yet full of the sweet things\\nof love and gratitude. Come! I feel prouder leading thee by thy\\nblack hand, than though I grasped an Emperor’s!”\\n“There go two daft ones now,” muttered the old Manxman. “One\\ndaft with strength, the other daft with weakness. But here’s the end\\nof the rotten line—all dripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had\\nbest have a new line altogether. I’ll see Mr. Stubb about it.”\\nCHAPTER 126. The Life-Buoy.\\nSteering now south-eastward by Ahab’s levelled steel, and her\\nprogress solely determined by Ahab’s level log and line; the Pequod\\nheld on her path towards the Equator. Making so long a passage\\nthrough such unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere\\nlong, sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves\\nmonotonously mild; all these seemed the strange calm things\\npreluding some riotous and desperate scene.\\nAt last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the\\nEquatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes\\nbefore the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch—\\nthen headed by Flask—was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and\\nunearthly—like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod’s\\nmurdered Innocents—that one and all, they started from their\\nreveries, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or\\nleaned all transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while\\nthat wild cry remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part\\nof the crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan\\nharpooneers remained unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman—the\\noldest mariner of all—declared that the wild thrilling sounds that\\nwere heard, were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea.\\nBelow in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn,\\nwhen he came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask,\\nnot unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly\\nlaughed, and thus explained the wonder.\\nThose rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great\\nnumbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or\\nsome dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship\\nand kept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human\\nsort of wail. But this only the more affected some of them, because\\nmost mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals,\\narising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also\\nfrom the human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent\\nfaces, seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside. In the sea,\\nunder certain circumstances, seals have more than once been\\nmistaken for men.\\nBut the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most\\nplausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that\\nmorning. At sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-\\nhead at the fore; and whether it was that he was not yet half waked\\nfrom his sleep (for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state),\\nwhether it was thus with the man, there is now no telling; but, be\\nthat as it may, he had not been long at his perch, when a cry was\\nheard—a cry and a rushing—and looking up, they saw a falling\\nphantom in the air; and looking down, a little tossed heap of white\\nbubbles in the blue of the sea.\\nThe life-buoy—a long slender cask—was dropped from the stern,\\nwhere it always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand\\nrose to seize it, and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had\\nshrunken, so that it slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled\\nat its every pore; and the studded iron-bound cask followed the\\nsailor to the bottom, as if to yield him his pillow, though in sooth\\nbut a hard one.\\nAnd thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to\\nlook out for the White Whale, on the White Whale’s own peculiar\\nground; that man was swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps,\\nthought of that at the time. Indeed, in some sort, they were not\\ngrieved at this event, at least as a portent; for they regarded it, not\\nas a foreshadowing of evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an\\nevil already presaged. They declared that now they knew the reason\\nof those wild shrieks they had heard the night before. But again the\\nold Manxman said nay.\\nThe lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed\\nto see to it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found,\\nand as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching\\ncrisis of the voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what\\nwas directly connected with its final end, whatever that might prove\\nto be; therefore, they were going to leave the ship’s stern\\nunprovided with a buoy, when by certain strange signs and\\ninuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin.\\n“A life-buoy of a coffin!” cried Starbuck, starting.\\n“Rather queer, that, I should say,” said Stubb.\\n“It will make a good enough one,” said Flask, “the carpenter here\\ncan arrange it easily.”\\n“Bring it up; there’s nothing else for it,” said Starbuck, after a\\nmelancholy pause. “Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so—the\\ncoffin, I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it.”\\n“And shall I nail down the lid, sir?” moving his hand as with a\\nhammer.\\n“Aye.”\\n“And shall I caulk the seams, sir?” moving his hand as with a\\ncaulking-iron.\\n“Aye.”\\n“And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?” moving his\\nhand as with a pitch-pot.\\n“Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the\\ncoffin, and no more.—Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.”\\n“He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he\\nbaulks. Now I don’t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he\\nwears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and\\nhe won’t put his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing\\nwith that coffin? And now I’m ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It’s\\nlike turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side\\nnow. I don’t like this cobbling sort of business—I don’t like it at all;\\nit’s undignified; it’s not my place. Let tinkers’ brats do tinkerings; we\\nare their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-\\nand-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at\\nthe beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an\\nend at the conclusion; not a cobbler’s job, that’s at an end in the\\nmiddle, and at the beginning at the end. It’s the old woman’s tricks\\nto be giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old women\\nhave for tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away\\nwith a bald-headed young tinker once. And that’s the reason I never\\nwould work for lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my\\njob-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely\\nold heads to run off with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea\\nbut snow-caps. Let me see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay\\nover the same with pitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with\\nthe snap-spring over the ship’s stern. Were ever such things done\\nbefore with a coffin? Some superstitious old carpenters, now, would\\nbe tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the job. But I’m made\\nof knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don’t budge. Cruppered with a\\ncoffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We\\nworkers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as\\ncoffins and hearses. We work by the month, or by the job, or by the\\nprofit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless\\nit be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. Hem!\\nI’ll do the job, now, tenderly. I’ll have me—let’s see—how many in\\nthe ship’s company, all told? But I’ve forgotten. Any way, I’ll have me\\nthirty separate, Turk’s-headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging\\nall round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down, there’ll be thirty\\nlively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often\\nbeneath the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and\\nmarling-spike! Let’s to it.”\\nCHAPTER 127. The Deck.\\nThe coffin laid upon two line-tubs, between the vice-bench and\\nthe open hatchway; the Carpenter caulking its seams; the string of\\ntwisted oakum slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the\\nbosom of his frock.—Ahab comes slowly from the cabin-gangway,\\nand hears Pip following him.\\n“Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this\\nhand complies with my humor more genially than that boy.—Middle\\naisle of a church! What’s here?”\\n“Life-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck’s orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the\\nhatchway!”\\n“Thank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.”\\n“Sir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does.”\\n“Art not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from\\nthy shop?”\\n“I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?”\\n“Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?”\\n“Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg;\\nbut they’ve set me now to turning it into something else.”\\n“Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,\\nmonopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs,\\nand the next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys\\nout of those same coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods,\\nand as much of a jack-of-all-trades.”\\n“But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.”\\n“The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about\\na coffin? The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out\\nthe craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings,\\nspade in hand. Dost thou never?”\\n“Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I’m indifferent enough, sir, for that; but\\nthe reason why the grave-digger made music must have been\\nbecause there was none in his spade, sir. But the caulking mallet is\\nfull of it. Hark to it.”\\n“Aye, and that’s because the lid there’s a sounding-board; and\\nwhat in all things makes the sounding-board is this—there’s naught\\nbeneath. And yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the\\nsame, Carpenter. Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the\\ncoffin knock against the churchyard gate, going in?\\n“Faith, sir, I’ve——”\\n“Faith? What’s that?”\\n“Why, faith, sir, it’s only a sort of exclamation-like—that’s all, sir.”\\n“Um, um; go on.”\\n“I was about to say, sir, that——”\\n“Art thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of\\nthyself? Look at thy bosom! Despatch! and get these traps out of\\nsight.”\\n“He goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in\\nhot latitudes. I’ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the\\nGallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle. Seems to me\\nsome sort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle.\\nHe’s always under the Line—fiery hot, I tell ye! He’s looking this way\\n—come, oakum; quick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the\\ncork, and I’m the professor of musical glasses—tap, tap!”\\n(Ahab to himself.)\\n“There’s a sight! There’s a sound! The greyheaded woodpecker\\ntapping the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well be envied now.\\nSee! that thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most\\nmalicious wag, that fellow. Rat-tat! So man’s seconds tick! Oh! how\\nimmaterial are all materials! What things real are there, but\\nimponderable thoughts? Here now’s the very dreaded symbol of\\ngrim death, by a mere hap, made the expressive sign of the help\\nand hope of most endangered life. A life-buoy of a coffin! Does it\\ngo further? Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is, after\\nall, but an immortality-preserver! I’ll think of that. But no. So far\\ngone am I in the dark side of earth, that its other side, the theoretic\\nbright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me. Will ye never have\\ndone, Carpenter, with that accursed sound? I go below; let me not\\nsee that thing here when I return again. Now, then, Pip, we’ll talk\\nthis over; I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee! Some\\nunknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee!”\\nCHAPTER 128. The Pequod\\nMeets The Rachel.\\nNext day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly\\ndown upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At\\nthe time the Pequod was making good speed through the water;\\nbut as the broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the\\nboastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and\\nall life fled from the smitten hull.\\n“Bad news; she brings bad news,” muttered the old Manxman. But\\nere her commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his\\nboat; ere he could hopefully hail, Ahab’s voice was heard.\\n“Hast seen the White Whale?”\\n“Aye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?”\\nThrottling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected\\nquestion; and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the\\nstranger captain himself, having stopped his vessel’s way, was seen\\ndescending her side. A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon\\nclinched the Pequod’s main-chains, and he sprang to the deck.\\nImmediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew.\\nBut no formal salutation was exchanged.\\n“Where was he?—not killed!—not killed!” cried Ahab, closely\\nadvancing. “How was it?”\\nIt seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day\\nprevious, while three of the stranger’s boats were engaged with a\\nshoal of whales, which had led them some four or five miles from\\nthe ship; and while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the\\nwhite hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out\\nof the water, not very far to leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged\\nboat—a reserved one—had been instantly lowered in chase. After a\\nkeen sail before the wind, this fourth boat—the swiftest keeled of all\\n—seemed to have succeeded in fastening—at least, as well as the\\nman at the mast-head could tell anything about it. In the distance\\nhe saw the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of\\nbubbling white water; and after that nothing more; whence it was\\nconcluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away\\nwith his pursuers, as often happens. There was some apprehension,\\nbut no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals were placed in the\\nrigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her three far to\\nwindward boats—ere going in quest of the fourth one in the\\nprecisely opposite direction—the ship had not only been\\nnecessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for\\nthe time, to increase her distance from it. But the rest of her crew\\nbeing at last safe aboard, she crowded all sail—stunsail on stunsail\\n—after the missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon;\\nand every other man aloft on the look-out. But though when she\\nhad thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of\\nthe absent ones when last seen; though she then paused to lower\\nher spare boats to pull all around her; and not finding anything, had\\nagain dashed on; again paused, and lowered her boats; and though\\nshe had thus continued doing till daylight; yet not the least glimpse\\nof the missing keel had been seen.\\nThe story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to\\nreveal his object in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to\\nunite with his own in the search; by sailing over the sea some four\\nor five miles apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double\\nhorizon, as it were.\\n“I will wager something now,” whispered Stubb to Flask, “that\\nsome one in that missing boat wore off that Captain’s best coat;\\nmayhap, his watch—he’s so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever\\nheard of two pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-\\nboat in the height of the whaling season? See, Flask, only see how\\npale he looks—pale in the very buttons of his eyes—look—it wasn’t\\nthe coat—it must have been the—”\\n“My boy, my own boy is among them. For God’s sake—I beg, I\\nconjure”—here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus\\nfar had but icily received his petition. “For eight-and-forty hours let\\nme charter your ship—I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it\\n—if there be no other way—for eight-and-forty hours only—only\\nthat—you must, oh, you must, and you shall do this thing.”\\n“His son!” cried Stubb, “oh, it’s his son he’s lost! I take back the\\ncoat and watch—what says Ahab? We must save that boy.”\\n“He’s drowned with the rest on ’em, last night,” said the old Manx\\nsailor standing behind them; “I heard; all of ye heard their spirits.”\\nNow, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the\\nRachel’s the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only\\nwas one of the Captain’s sons among the number of the missing\\nboat’s crew; but among the number of the other boat’s crews, at the\\nsame time, but on the other hand, separated from the ship during\\nthe dark vicissitudes of the chase, there had been still another son;\\nas that for a time, the wretched father was plunged to the bottom\\nof the cruellest perplexity; which was only solved for him by his\\nchief mate’s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a\\nwhale-ship in such emergencies, that is, when placed between\\njeopardized but divided boats, always to pick up the majority first.\\nBut the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had\\nrefrained from mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab’s\\niciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but\\ntwelve years old, whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving\\nhardihood of a Nantucketer’s paternal love, had thus early sought to\\ninitiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost\\nimmemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it unfrequently\\noccur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age\\naway from them, for a protracted three or four years’ voyage in\\nsome other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of a\\nwhaleman’s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a\\nfather’s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness\\nand concern.\\nMeantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of\\nAhab; and Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but\\nwithout the least quivering of his own.\\n“I will not go,” said the stranger, “till you say aye to me. Do to me\\nas you would have me do to you in the like case. For you too have\\na boy, Captain Ahab—though but a child, and nestling safely at\\nhome now—a child of your old age too—Yes, yes, you relent; I see\\nit—run, run, men, now, and stand by to square in the yards.”\\n“Avast,” cried Ahab—“touch not a rope-yarn”; then in a voice that\\nprolongingly moulded every word—“Captain Gardiner, I will not do\\nit. Even now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man,\\nand may I forgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the\\nbinnacle watch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn\\noff all strangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as\\nbefore.”\\nHurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,\\nleaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter\\nrejection of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment,\\nGardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his\\nboat, and returned to his ship.\\nSoon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange\\nvessel was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every\\ndark spot, however small, on the sea. This way and that her yards\\nwere swung round; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack;\\nnow she beat against a head sea; and again it pushed her before it;\\nwhile all the while, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with\\nmen, as three tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among\\nthe boughs.\\nBut by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you\\nplainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained\\nwithout comfort. She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because\\nthey were not.\\nCHAPTER 129. The Cabin.\\n(Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to\\nfollow.)\\n“Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is\\ncoming when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not\\nhave thee by him. There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too\\ncuring to my malady. Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady\\nbecomes my most desired health. Do thou abide below here, where\\nthey shall serve thee, as if thou wert the captain. Aye, lad, thou shalt\\nsit here in my own screwed chair; another screw to it, thou must\\nbe.”\\n“No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor\\nme for your one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so\\nI remain a part of ye.”\\n“Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless\\nfidelity of man!—and a black! and crazy!—but methinks like-cures-\\nlike applies to him too; he grows so sane again.”\\n“They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip,\\nwhose drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his\\nliving skin. But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him. Sir, I must\\ngo with ye.”\\n“If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab’s purpose keels up\\nin him. I tell thee no; it cannot be.”\\n“Oh good master, master, master!\\n“Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is\\nmad. Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck,\\nand still know that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!—\\nMet! True art thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre. So: God\\nfor ever bless thee; and if it come to that,—God for ever save thee,\\nlet what will befall.”\\n(Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward.)\\n“Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,—but I’m alone. Now\\nwere even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he’s missing. Pip! Pip!\\nDing, dong, ding! Who’s seen Pip? He must be up here; let’s try the\\ndoor. What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there’s no\\nopening it. It must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and\\ntold me this screwed chair was mine. Here, then, I’ll seat me, against\\nthe transom, in the ship’s full middle, all her keel and her three\\nmasts before me. Here, our old sailors say, in their black seventy-\\nfours great admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of\\ncaptains and lieutenants. Ha! what’s this? epaulets! epaulets! the\\nepaulets all come crowding! Pass round the decanters; glad to see\\nye; fill up, monsieurs! What an odd feeling, now, when a black boy’s\\nhost to white men with gold lace upon their coats!—Monsieurs,\\nhave ye seen one Pip?—a little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog\\nlook, and cowardly! Jumped from a whale-boat once;—seen him?\\nNo! Well then, fill up again, captains, and let’s drink shame upon all\\ncowards! I name no names. Shame upon them! Put one foot upon\\nthe table. Shame upon all cowards.—Hist! above there, I hear ivory\\n—Oh, master! master! I am indeed down-hearted when you walk\\nover me. But here I’ll stay, though this stern strikes rocks; and they\\nbulge through; and oysters come to join me.”\\nCHAPTER 130. The Hat.\\nAnd now that at the proper time and place, after so long and\\nwide a preliminary cruise, Ahab,—all other whaling waters swept—\\nseemed to have chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the\\nmore securely there; now, that he found himself hard by the very\\nlatitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been\\ninflicted; now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day\\npreceding had actually encountered Moby Dick;—and now that all\\nhis successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred\\nto show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore\\nhis hunters, whether sinning or sinned against; now it was that there\\nlurked a something in the old man’s eyes, which it was hardly\\nsufferable for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting polar star, which\\nthrough the livelong, arctic, six months’ night sustains its piercing,\\nsteady, central gaze; so Ahab’s purpose now fixedly gleamed down\\nupon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It domineered\\nabove them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were\\nfain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a single spear\\nor leaf.\\nIn this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,\\nvanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more\\nstrove to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed\\nground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped\\nmortar of Ahab’s iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved\\nabout the deck, ever conscious that the old man’s despot eye was\\non them.\\nBut did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours;\\nwhen he thought no glance but one was on him; then you would\\nhave seen that even as Ahab’s eyes so awed the crew’s, the\\ninscrutable Parsee’s glance awed his; or somehow, at least, in some\\nwild way, at times affected it. Such an added, gliding strangeness\\nbegan to invest the thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless shudderings\\nshook him; that the men looked dubious at him; half uncertain, as it\\nseemed, whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or else a\\ntremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being’s\\nbody. And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by night,\\neven, had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go\\nbelow. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his\\nwan but wondrous eyes did plainly say—We two watchmen never\\nrest.\\nNor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step\\nupon the deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his\\npivot-hole, or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating\\nlimits,—the main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing\\nin the cabin-scuttle,—his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if\\nto step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however\\nmotionless he stood, however the days and nights were added on,\\nthat he had not swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that\\nslouching hat, they could never tell unerringly whether, for all this,\\nhis eyes were really closed at times; or whether he was still intently\\nscanning them; no matter, though he stood so in the scuttle for a\\nwhole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp gathered\\nin beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat. The clothes\\nthat the night had wet, the next day’s sunshine dried upon him; and\\nso, day after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath\\nthe planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent\\nfor.\\nHe ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,—\\nbreakfast and dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his\\nbeard; which darkly grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees\\nblown over, which still grow idly on at naked base, though perished\\nin the upper verdure. But though his whole life was now become\\none watch on deck; and though the Parsee’s mystic watch was\\nwithout intermission as his own; yet these two never seemed to\\nspeak—one man to the other—unless at long intervals some\\npassing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a\\npotent spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the\\nawe-struck crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they\\nchanced to speak one word; by night, dumb men were both, so far\\nas concerned the slightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest\\nhours, without a single hail, they stood far parted in the starlight;\\nAhab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly\\ngazing upon each other; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown\\nshadow, in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance.\\nAnd yet, somehow, did Ahab—in his own proper self, as daily,\\nhourly, \\nand \\nevery \\ninstant, \\ncommandingly \\nrevealed \\nto \\nhis\\nsubordinates,—Ahab seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but\\nhis slave. Still again both seemed yoked together, and an unseen\\ntyrant driving them; the lean shade siding the solid rib. For be this\\nParsee what he may, all rib and keel was solid Ahab.\\nAt the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was\\nheard from aft,—“Man the mast-heads!”—and all through the day,\\ntill after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the\\nstriking of the helmsman’s bell, was heard—“What d’ye see?—sharp!\\nsharp!”\\nBut when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the\\nchildren-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the\\nmonomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew’s fidelity; at\\nleast, of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to\\ndoubt, even, whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook\\nthe sight he sought. But if these suspicions were really his, he\\nsagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them, however his\\nactions might seem to hint them.\\n“I will have the first sight of the whale myself,”—he said. “Aye!\\nAhab must have the doubloon!” and with his own hands he rigged\\na nest of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single\\nsheaved block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the\\ntwo ends of the downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his\\nbasket prepared a pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the\\nrail. This done, with that end yet in his hand and standing beside\\nthe pin, he looked round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the\\nother; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego;\\nbut shunning Fedallah; and then settling his firm relying eye upon\\nthe chief mate, said,—“Take the rope, sir—I give it into thy hands,\\nStarbuck.” Then arranging his person in the basket, he gave the\\nword for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one\\nwho secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it. And\\nthus, with one hand clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed\\nabroad upon the sea for miles and miles,—ahead, astern, this side,\\nand that,—within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great\\na height.\\nWhen in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated\\nplace in the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor\\nat sea is hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope;\\nunder these circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given\\nin strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it.\\nBecause in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various\\ndifferent relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what\\nis seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes\\nare being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings, it\\nwould be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a constant\\nwatchman, the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the\\ncrew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea. So Ahab’s\\nproceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing\\nabout them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man\\nwho had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest\\ndegree approaching to decision—one of those too, whose\\nfaithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;—it\\nwas strange, that this was the very man he should select for his\\nwatchman; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise\\ndistrusted person’s hands.\\nNow, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there\\nten minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so\\noften fly incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of\\nwhalemen in these latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and\\nscreaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings.\\nThen it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air; then\\nspiralized downwards, and went eddying again round his head.\\nBut with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab\\nseemed not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else\\nhave marked it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only\\nnow almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of\\ncunning meaning in almost every sight.\\n“Your hat, your hat, sir!” suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who\\nbeing posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab,\\nthough somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air\\ndividing them.\\nBut already the sable wing was before the old man’s eyes; the\\nlong hooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted\\naway with his prize.\\nAn eagle flew thrice round Tarquin’s head, removing his cap to\\nreplace it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin\\nwould be king of Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was\\nthat omen accounted good. Ahab’s hat was never restored; the wild\\nhawk flew on and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last\\ndisappeared; while from the point of that disappearance, a minute\\nblack spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into\\nthe sea.\\nCHAPTER 131. The Pequod\\nMeets The Delight.\\nThe intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by;\\nthe life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most\\nmiserably misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all\\neyes were fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in\\nsome whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or\\nnine feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.\\nUpon the stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs,\\nand some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-\\nboat; but you now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see\\nthrough the peeled, half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a\\nhorse.\\n“Hast seen the White Whale?”\\n“Look!” replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and\\nwith his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.\\n“Hast killed him?”\\n“The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,” answered\\nthe other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck,\\nwhose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing\\ntogether.\\n“Not forged!” and snatching Perth’s levelled iron from the crotch,\\nAhab held it out, exclaiming—“Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this\\nhand I hold his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by\\nlightning are these barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that\\nhot place behind the fin, where the White Whale most feels his\\naccursed life!”\\n“Then God keep thee, old man—see’st thou that”—pointing to\\nthe hammock—“I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive\\nonly yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only that one I bury; the\\nrest were buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.” Then\\nturning to his crew—“Are ye ready there? place the plank then on\\nthe rail, and lift the body; so, then—Oh! God”—advancing towards\\nthe hammock with uplifted hands—“may the resurrection and the\\nlife——”\\n“Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like lightning to his men.\\nBut the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape\\nthe sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the\\nsea; not so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might\\nhave sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.\\nAs Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-\\nbuoy hanging at the Pequod’s stern came into conspicuous relief.\\n“Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!” cried a foreboding voice in her\\nwake. “In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us\\nyour taffrail to show us your coffin!”\\nCHAPTER 132. The Symphony.\\nIt was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were\\nhardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air\\nwas transparently pure and soft, with a woman’s look, and the\\nrobust and man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells,\\nas Samson’s chest in his sleep.\\nHither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,\\nunspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine\\nair; but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue,\\nrushed mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were\\nthe strong, troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.\\nBut though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in\\nshades and shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only\\nthe sex, as it were, that distinguished them.\\nAloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle\\nair to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the\\ngirdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion—most\\nseen here at the equator—denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the\\nloving alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.\\nTied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly\\nfirm and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the\\nashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the\\nmorn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl’s\\nforehead of heaven.\\nOh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible\\nwinged creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and\\nsky! how oblivious were ye of old Ahab’s close-coiled woe! But so\\nhave I seen little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves,\\nheedlessly gambol around their old sire; sporting with the circle of\\nsinged locks which grew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of\\nhis brain.\\nSlowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the\\nside and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his\\ngaze, the more and the more that he strove to pierce the\\nprofundity. But the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last\\nseem to dispel, for a moment, the cankerous thing in his soul. That\\nglad, happy air, that winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him;\\nthe step-mother world, so long cruel—forbidding—now threw\\naffectionate arms round his stubborn neck, and did seem to\\njoyously sob over him, as if over one, that however wilful and erring,\\nshe could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless. From beneath\\nhis slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the\\nPacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop.\\nStarbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over\\nthe side; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the\\nmeasureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity\\naround. Careful not to touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew\\nnear to him, and stood there.\\nAhab turned.\\n“Starbuck!”\\n“Sir.”\\n“Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On\\nsuch a day—very much such a sweetness as this—I struck my first\\nwhale—a boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty—forty—forty years\\nago!—ago! Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of privation,\\nand peril, and storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty\\nyears has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make\\nwar on the horrors of the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those\\nforty years I have not spent three ashore. When I think of this life I\\nhave led; the desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned,\\nwalled-town of a Captain’s exclusiveness, which admits but small\\nentrance to any sympathy from the green country without—oh,\\nweariness! heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery of solitary command!—\\nwhen I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so keenly known to\\nme before—and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted fare\\n—fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!—when the poorest\\nlandsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the\\nworld’s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts—away, whole oceans away,\\nfrom that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for Cape\\nHorn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow—\\nwife? wife?—rather a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I widowed\\nthat poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness,\\nthe frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking brow, with which, for\\na thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly chased his\\nprey—more a demon than a man!—aye, aye! what a forty years’\\nfool—fool—old fool, has old Ahab been! Why this strife of the\\nchase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and\\nthe lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh,\\nStarbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor\\nleg should have been snatched from under me? Here, brush this old\\nhair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did\\nnever grow but from out some ashes! But do I look very old, so\\nvery, very old, Starbuck? I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as\\nthough I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries since\\nParadise. God! God! God!—crack my heart!—stave my brain!—\\nmockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have I lived\\nenough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably old?\\nClose! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human eye; it\\nis better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze upon\\nGod. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the\\nmagic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no;\\nstay on board, on board!—lower not when I do; when branded\\nAhab gives chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No,\\nno! not with the far away home I see in that eye!”\\n“Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after\\nall! why should any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with\\nme! let us fly these deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too,\\nare Starbuck’s—wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow\\nyouth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,\\nlonging, paternal old age! Away! let us away!—this instant let me\\nalter the course! How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would\\nwe bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they\\nhave some such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket.”\\n“They have, they have. I have seen them—some summer days in\\nthe morning. About this time—yes, it is his noon nap now—the boy\\nvivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of\\ncannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come\\nback to dance him again.”\\n“’Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every\\nmorning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of\\nhis father’s sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for\\nNantucket! Come, my Captain, study out the course, and let us\\naway! See, see! the boy’s face from the window! the boy’s hand on\\nthe hill!”\\nBut Ahab’s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook,\\nand cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.\\n“What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what\\ncozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor\\ncommands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so\\nkeep pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time;\\nrecklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural\\nheart, I durst not so much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or\\nwho, that lifts this arm? But if the great sun move not of himself;\\nbut is as an errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve,\\nbut by some invisible power; how then can this one small heart\\nbeat; this one small brain think thoughts; unless God does that\\nbeating, does that thinking, does that living, and not I. By heaven,\\nman, we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder\\nwindlass, and Fate is the handspike. And all the time, lo! that smiling\\nsky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon Albicore! who put it into\\nhim to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where do murderers go,\\nman! Who’s to doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the\\nbar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and the air\\nsmells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have been\\nmaking hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck,\\nand the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping?\\nAye, toil we how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep?\\nAye, and rust amid greenness; as last year’s scythes flung down, and\\nleft in the half-cut swaths—Starbuck!”\\nBut blanched to a corpse’s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen\\naway.\\nAhab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started\\nat two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was\\nmotionlessly leaning over the same rail.\\nCHAPTER 133. The Chase—\\nFirst Day.\\nThat night, in the mid-watch, when the old man—as his wont at\\nintervals—stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and\\nwent to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely,\\nsnuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship’s dog will, in drawing\\nnigh to some barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near.\\nSoon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth\\nby the living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was\\nany mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then\\nthe dog-vane, and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor\\nas nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship’s course to be\\nslightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.\\nThe acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently\\nvindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea\\ndirectly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the\\npleated watery wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like\\nmarks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.\\n“Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!”\\nThundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the\\nforecastle deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment\\nclaps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so\\ninstantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands.\\n“What d’ye see?” cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.\\n“Nothing, nothing sir!” was the sound hailing down in reply.\\n“T’gallant sails!—stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!”\\nAll sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for\\nswaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments\\nthey were hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the\\nway aloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy\\nbetween the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like\\ncry in the air. “There she blows!—there she blows! A hump like a\\nsnow-hill! It is Moby Dick!”\\nFired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the\\nthree look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold\\nthe famous whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now\\ngained his final perch, some feet above the other look-outs,\\nTashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-\\nmast, so that the Indian’s head was almost on a level with Ahab’s\\nheel. From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so\\nahead, at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump,\\nand regularly jetting his silent spout into the air. To the credulous\\nmariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago\\nbeheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\\n“And did none of ye see it before?” cried Ahab, hailing the\\nperched men all around him.\\n“I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did,\\nand I cried out,” said Tashtego.\\n“Not the same instant; not the same—no, the doubloon is mine,\\nFate reserved the doubloon for me. I only; none of ye could have\\nraised the White Whale first. There she blows!—there she blows!—\\nthere she blows! There again!—there again!” he cried, in long-\\ndrawn, lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual\\nprolongings of the whale’s visible jets. “He’s going to sound! In\\nstunsails! Down top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck,\\nremember, stay on board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a\\npoint! So; steady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black\\nwater! All ready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr.\\nStarbuck; lower, lower,—quick, quicker!” and he slid through the air\\nto the deck.\\n“He is heading straight to leeward, sir,” cried Stubb, “right away\\nfrom us; cannot have seen the ship yet.”\\n“Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!—\\nbrace up! Shiver her!—shiver her!—So; well that! Boats, boats!”\\nSoon all the boats but Starbuck’s were dropped; all the boat-sails\\nset—all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to\\nleeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up\\nFedallah’s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.\\nLike noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the\\nsea; but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the\\nocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its\\nwaves; seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the\\nbreathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey,\\nthat his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the\\nsea as if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of\\nfinest, fleecy, greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of\\nthe slightly projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft\\nTurkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his\\nbroad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the\\nshade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into\\nthe moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright\\nbubbles arose and danced by his side. But these were broken again\\nby the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea,\\nalternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising\\nfrom the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a\\nrecent lance projected from the white whale’s back; and at intervals\\none of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro\\nskimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked on\\nthis pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.\\nA gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,\\ninvested the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming\\naway with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely,\\nleering eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching\\nfleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove,\\nnot that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White\\nWhale as he so divinely swam.\\nOn each soft side—coincident with the parted swell, that but once\\nleaving him, then flowed so wide away—on each bright side, the\\nwhale shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among\\nthe hunters who namelessly transported and allured by all this\\nserenity, had ventured to assail it; but had fatally found that\\nquietude but the vesture of tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh,\\nwhale! thou glidest on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no\\nmatter how many in that same way thou may’st have bejuggled and\\ndestroyed before.\\nAnd thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea,\\namong waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding\\nrapture, Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full\\nterrors of his submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched\\nhideousness of his jaw. But soon the fore part of him slowly rose\\nfrom the water; for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a\\nhigh arch, like Virginia’s Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his\\nbannered flukes in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded,\\nand went out of sight. Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing,\\nthe white sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that\\nhe left.\\nWith oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails\\nadrift, the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick’s\\nreappearance.\\n“An hour,” said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat’s stern; and he\\ngazed beyond the whale’s place, towards the dim blue spaces and\\nwide wooing vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again\\nhis eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery\\ncircle. The breeze now freshened; the sea began to swell.\\n“The birds!—the birds!” cried Tashtego.\\nIn long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were\\nnow all flying towards Ahab’s boat; and when within a few yards\\nbegan fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round,\\nwith joyous, expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man’s;\\nAhab could discover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered\\ndown and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living\\nspot no bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising,\\nand magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly\\nrevealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating\\nup from the undiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick’s open mouth\\nand scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the\\nblue of the sea. The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like\\nan open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with\\nhis steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous\\napparition. Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him,\\nwent forward to the bows, and seizing Perth’s harpoon, commanded\\nhis crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.\\nNow, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its\\naxis, its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale’s head\\nwhile yet under water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby\\nDick, with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly\\ntransplanted himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated\\nhead lengthwise beneath the boat.\\nThrough and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled\\nfor an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner\\nof a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his\\nmouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up\\ninto the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The\\nbluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of\\nAhab’s head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the\\nWhite Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her\\nmouse. With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his\\narms; but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other’s\\nheads to gain the uttermost stern.\\nAnd now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out,\\nas the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and\\nfrom his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be\\ndarted at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as\\nit were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a\\nquick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac\\nAhab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed\\nhim all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all\\nthis, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly\\nstrove to wrench it from its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the\\njaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and\\nsnapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft,\\nbit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again\\nin the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks. These floated\\naside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck\\nclinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to\\nlash them across.\\nAt that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab,\\nthe first to perceive the whale’s intent, by the crafty upraising of his\\nhead, a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that\\nmoment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of\\nthe bite. But only slipping further into the whale’s mouth, and tilting\\nover sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the\\njaw; spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell\\nflat-faced upon the sea.\\nRipplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a\\nlittle distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and\\ndown in the billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his\\nwhole spindled body; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose\\n—some twenty or more feet out of the water—the now rising\\nswells, with all their confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it;\\nvindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air.* So,\\nin a gale, the but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the\\nbase of the Eddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with\\ntheir scud.\\n*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its\\ndesignation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary\\nup-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called\\npitchpoling, previously described. By this motion the whale must\\nbest and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be\\nencircling him.\\nBut soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam\\nswiftly round and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the\\nwater in his vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another\\nand more deadly assault. The sight of the splintered boat seemed to\\nmadden him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before\\nAntiochus’s elephants in the book of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab\\nhalf smothered in the foam of the whale’s insolent tail, and too\\nmuch of a cripple to swim,—though he could still keep afloat, even\\nin the heart of such a whirlpool as that; helpless Ahab’s head was\\nseen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst.\\nFrom the boat’s fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly\\neyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not\\nsuccor him; more than enough was it for them to look to\\nthemselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale’s\\naspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made,\\nthat he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the\\nother boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not\\npull into the eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the\\ninstant destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor\\nin that case could they themselves hope to escape. With straining\\neyes, then, they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone,\\nwhose centre had now become the old man’s head.\\nMeantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the\\nship’s mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down\\nupon the scene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed\\nher!—“Sail on the”—but that moment a breaking sea dashed on\\nhim from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time. But struggling\\nout of it again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he\\nshouted,—“Sail on the whale!—Drive him off!”\\nThe Pequod’s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed\\ncircle, she effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he\\nsullenly swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.\\nDragged into Stubb’s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the\\nwhite brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab’s bodily\\nstrength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body’s doom: for\\na time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb’s boat, like one\\ntrodden under foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails\\ncame from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.\\nBut this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the\\nmore abbreviate it. In an instant’s compass, great hearts sometimes\\ncondense to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains\\nkindly diffused through feebler men’s whole lives. And so, such\\nhearts, though summary in each one suffering; still, if the gods\\ndecree it, in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly\\nmade up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless\\ncentres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of\\ninferior souls.\\n“The harpoon,” said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning\\non one bended arm—“is it safe?”\\n“Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,” said Stubb, showing it.\\n“Lay it before me;—any missing men?”\\n“One, two, three, four, five;—there were five oars, sir, and here are\\nfive men.”\\n“That’s good.—Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him!\\nthere! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!—Hands\\noff from me! The eternal sap runs up in Ahab’s bones again! Set the\\nsail; out oars; the helm!”\\nIt is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being\\npicked up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the\\nchase is thus continued with what is called double-banked oars. It\\nwas thus now. But the added power of the boat did not equal the\\nadded power of the whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his\\nevery fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that if\\nnow, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove\\nan indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew\\nendure for so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining\\nat the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief\\nvicissitude. The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered\\nthe most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase.\\nAccordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up\\nto their cranes—the two parts of the wrecked boat having been\\npreviously secured by her—and then hoisting everything to her side,\\nand stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with\\nstun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod\\nbore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At the well known,\\nmethodic intervals, the whale’s glittering spout was regularly\\nannounced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be\\nreported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then\\npacing the deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second\\nof the allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.—“Whose is the\\ndoubloon now? D’ye see him?” and if the reply was, No, sir!\\nstraightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch. In this\\nway the day wore on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless; anon,\\nunrestingly pacing the planks.\\nAs he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men\\naloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a\\nstill greater breadth—thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched\\nhat, at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been\\ndropped upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow\\nto shattered stern. At last he paused before it; and as in an already\\nover-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across,\\nso over the old man’s face there now stole some such added gloom\\nas this.\\nStubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though,\\nto evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant\\nplace in his Captain’s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck\\nexclaimed—“The thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too\\nkeenly, sir; ha! ha!”\\n“What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man,\\nman! did I not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I\\ncould swear thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard\\nbefore a wreck.”\\n“Aye, sir,” said Starbuck drawing near, “’tis a solemn sight; an\\nomen, and an ill one.”\\n“Omen? omen?—the dictionary! If the gods think to speak\\noutright to man, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their\\nheads, and give an old wives’ darkling hint.—Begone! Ye two are the\\nopposite poles of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb\\nis Starbuck; and ye two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone\\namong the millions of the peopled earth, nor gods nor men his\\nneighbors! Cold, cold—I shiver!—How now? Aloft there! D’ye see\\nhim? Sing out for every spout, though he spout ten times a\\nsecond!”\\nThe day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was\\nrustling. Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still\\nremained unset.\\n“Can’t see the spout now, sir;—too dark”—cried a voice from the\\nair.\\n“How heading when last seen?”\\n“As before, sir,—straight to leeward.”\\n“Good! he will travel slower now ’tis night. Down royals and top-\\ngallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before\\nmorning; he’s making a passage now, and may heave-to a while.\\nHelm there! keep her full before the wind!—Aloft! come down!—Mr.\\nStubb, send a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned\\ntill morning.”—Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-\\nmast—“Men, this gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide\\nhere till the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first\\nraises him, upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that man’s;\\nand if on that day I shall again raise him, then, ten times its sum\\nshall be divided among all of ye! Away now!—the deck is thine, sir!”\\nAnd so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and\\nslouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals\\nrousing himself to see how the night wore on.\\nCHAPTER 134. The Chase—\\nSecond Day.\\nAt day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned\\nafresh.\\n“D’ye see him?” cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the\\nlight to spread.\\n“See nothing, sir.”\\n“Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought\\nfor;—the top-gallant sails!—aye, they should have been kept on her\\nall night. But no matter—’tis but resting for the rush.”\\nHere be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular\\nwhale, continued through day into night, and through night into\\nday, is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery.\\nFor such is the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and\\ninvincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses\\namong the Nantucket commanders; that from the simple\\nobservation of a whale when last descried, they will, under certain\\ngiven circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the direction in\\nwhich he will continue to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well\\nas his probable rate of progression during that period. And, in these\\ncases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a coast,\\nwhose general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly\\nto return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands\\nby his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at\\npresent visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote,\\nunseen headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at\\nhis compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently\\nmarked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night\\nobscures the fish, the creature’s future wake through the darkness is\\nalmost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the\\npilot’s coast is to him. So that to this hunter’s wondrous skill, the\\nproverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all\\ndesired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land. And as\\nthe mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly\\nknown in its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time\\nhis rate as doctors that of a baby’s pulse; and lightly say of it, the\\nup train or the down train will reach such or such a spot, at such or\\nsuch an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these\\nNantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to\\nthe observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many\\nhours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have\\nabout reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to\\nrender this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the\\nsea must be the whaleman’s allies; for of what present avail to the\\nbecalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is\\nexactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable\\nfrom these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching\\nthe chase of whales.\\nThe ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a\\ncannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the\\nlevel field.\\n“By salt and hemp!” cried Stubb, “but this swift motion of the\\ndeck creeps up one’s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I\\nare two brave fellows!—Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch\\nme, spine-wise, on the sea,—for by live-oaks! my spine’s a keel. Ha,\\nha! we go the gait that leaves no dust behind!”\\n“There she blows—she blows!—she blows!—right ahead!” was\\nnow the mast-head cry.\\n“Aye, aye!” cried Stubb, “I knew it—ye can’t escape—blow on and\\nsplit your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow\\nyour trump—blister your lungs!—Ahab will dam off your blood, as a\\nmiller shuts his watergate upon the stream!”\\nAnd Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The\\nfrenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up,\\nlike old wine worked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings\\nsome of them might have felt before; these were not only now kept\\nout of sight through the growing awe of Ahab, but they were\\nbroken up, and on all sides routed, as timid prairie hares that scatter\\nbefore the bounding bison. The hand of Fate had snatched all their\\nsouls; and by the stirring perils of the previous day; the rack of the\\npast night’s suspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in\\nwhich their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark; by all\\nthese things, their hearts were bowled along. The wind that made\\ngreat bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible\\nas irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which\\nso enslaved them to the race.\\nThey were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them\\nall; though it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and\\nmaple, and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran\\ninto each other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both\\nbalanced and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the\\nindividualities of the crew, this man’s valor, that man’s fear; guilt and\\nguiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all\\ndirected to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did\\npoint to.\\nThe rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\\noutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with\\none hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings;\\nothers, shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the\\nrocking yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe\\nfor their fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness\\nto seek out the thing that might destroy them!\\n“Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?” cried Ahab, when,\\nafter the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had\\nbeen heard. “Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby\\nDick casts one odd jet that way, and then disappears.”\\nIt was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had\\nmistaken some other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself\\nsoon proved; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the\\nrope belayed to its pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an\\norchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the combined\\ndischarges of rifles. The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs\\nwas heard, as—much nearer to the ship than the place of the\\nimaginary jet, less than a mile ahead—Moby Dick bodily burst into\\nview! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not by the\\npeaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the White\\nWhale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous\\nphenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the\\nfurthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into\\nthe pure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam,\\nshows his place to the distance of seven miles and more. In those\\nmoments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in\\nsome cases, this breaching is his act of defiance.\\n“There she breaches! there she breaches!” was the cry, as in his\\nimmeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-\\nlike to Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and\\nrelieved against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he\\nraised, for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a\\nglacier; and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its\\nfirst sparkling intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower\\nin a vale.\\n“Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!” cried Ahab, “thy\\nhour and thy harpoon are at hand!—Down! down all of ye, but one\\nman at the fore. The boats!—stand by!”\\nUnmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men,\\nlike shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and\\nhalyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped\\nfrom his perch.\\n“Lower away,” he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat—a\\nspare one, rigged the afternoon previous. “Mr. Starbuck, the ship is\\nthine—keep away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!”\\nAs if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first\\nassailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for\\nthe three crews. Ahab’s boat was central; and cheering his men, he\\ntold them he would take the whale head-and-head,—that is, pull\\nstraight up to his forehead,—a not uncommon thing; for when\\nwithin a certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from\\nthe whale’s sidelong vision. But ere that close limit was gained, and\\nwhile yet all three boats were plain as the ship’s three masts to his\\neye; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in\\nan instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and\\na lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of\\nthe irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on\\nannihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made.\\nBut skilfully manœuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers\\nin the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but\\nby a plank’s breadth; while all the time, Ahab’s unearthly slogan tore\\nevery other cry but his to shreds.\\nBut at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so\\ncrossed and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack\\nof the three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of\\nthemselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in\\nhim; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to\\nrally for a more tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab\\nfirst paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in\\nupon it again—hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls—\\nwhen lo!—a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks!\\nCaught and twisted—corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose\\nharpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came\\nflashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab’s boat.\\nOnly one thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically\\nreached within—through—and then, without—the rays of steel;\\ndragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman,\\nand then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks—dropped the\\nintercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That\\ninstant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining\\ntangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more\\ninvolved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed them\\ntogether like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and then,\\ndiving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom, in\\nwhich, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced\\nround and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of\\npunch.\\nWhile the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out\\nafter the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while\\naslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching\\nhis legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb\\nwas lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the\\nold man’s line—now parting—admitted of his pulling into the\\ncreamy \\npool \\nto \\nrescue \\nwhom \\nhe \\ncould;—in \\nthat \\nwild\\nsimultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils,—Ahab’s yet\\nunstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by invisible\\nwires,—as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from the sea, the\\nWhite Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom, and\\nsent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell again—gunwale\\ndownwards—and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it,\\nlike seals from a sea-side cave.\\nThe first uprising momentum of the whale—modifying its\\ndirection as he struck the surface—involuntarily launched him along\\nit, to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had\\nmade; and with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly\\nfeeling with his flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar,\\nbit of plank, the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin,\\nhis tail swiftly drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea. But\\nsoon, as if satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed\\nhis pleated forehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the\\nintertangled lines, continued his leeward way at a traveller’s\\nmethodic pace.\\nAs before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight,\\nagain came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat,\\npicked up the floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could\\nbe caught at, and safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained\\nshoulders, wrists, and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons\\nand lances; inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and\\nplanks; all these were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed\\nto have befallen any one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab\\nwas now found grimly clinging to his boat’s broken half, which\\nafforded a comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the\\nprevious day’s mishap.\\nBut when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon\\nhim; as instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the\\nshoulder of Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist\\nhim. His ivory leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short\\nsharp splinter.\\n“Aye, aye, Starbuck, ’tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner\\nwho he will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.”\\n“The ferrule has not stood, sir,” said the carpenter, now coming\\nup; “I put good work into that leg.”\\n“But no bones broken, sir, I hope,” said Stubb with true concern.\\n“Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!—d’ye see it.—But even\\nwith a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living\\nbone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that’s lost. Nor\\nwhite whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in\\nhis own proper and inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder\\nfloor, any mast scrape yonder roof?—Aloft there! which way?”\\n“Dead to leeward, sir.”\\n“Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest\\nof the spare boats and rig them—Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the\\nboat’s crews.”\\n“Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.”\\n“Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that\\nthe unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven\\nmate!”\\n“Sir?”\\n“My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane—there,\\nthat shivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen\\nhim yet. By heaven it cannot be!—missing?—quick! call them all.”\\nThe old man’s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the\\ncompany, the Parsee was not there.\\n“The Parsee!” cried Stubb—“he must have been caught in——”\\n“The black vomit wrench thee!—run all of ye above, alow, cabin,\\nforecastle—find him—not gone—not gone!”\\nBut quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee\\nwas nowhere to be found.\\n“Aye, sir,” said Stubb—“caught among the tangles of your line—I\\nthought I saw him dragging under.”\\n“My line! my line? Gone?—gone? What means that little word?—\\nWhat death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the\\nbelfry. The harpoon, too!—toss over the litter there,—d’ye see it?—\\nthe forged iron, men, the white whale’s—no, no, no,—blistered fool!\\nthis hand did dart it!—’tis in the fish!—Aloft there! Keep him nailed\\n—Quick!—all hands to the rigging of the boats—collect the oars—\\nharpooneers! the irons, the irons!—hoist the royals higher—a pull\\non all the sheets!—helm there! steady, steady for your life! I’ll ten\\ntimes girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight through it,\\nbut I’ll slay him yet!”\\n“Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,” cried\\nStarbuck; “never, never wilt thou capture him, old man—In Jesus’\\nname no more of this, that’s worse than devil’s madness. Two days\\nchased; twice stove to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched\\nfrom under thee; thy evil shadow gone—all good angels mobbing\\nthee with warnings:—what more wouldst thou have?—Shall we keep\\nchasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man? Shall we\\nbe dragged by him to the bottom of the sea? Shall we be towed by\\nhim to the infernal world? Oh, oh,—Impiety and blasphemy to hunt\\nhim more!”\\n“Starbuck, of late I’ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that\\nhour we both saw—thou know’st what, in one another’s eyes. But in\\nthis matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm\\nof this hand—a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab,\\nman. This whole act’s immutably decreed. ’Twas rehearsed by thee\\nand me a billion years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates’\\nlieutenant; I act under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou\\nobeyest mine.—Stand round me, men. Ye see an old man cut down\\nto the stump; leaning on a shivered lance; propped up on a lonely\\nfoot. ’Tis Ahab—his body’s part; but Ahab’s soul’s a centipede, that\\nmoves upon a hundred legs. I feel strained, half stranded, as ropes\\nthat tow dismasted frigates in a gale; and I may look so. But ere I\\nbreak, ye’ll hear me crack; and till ye hear that, know that Ahab’s\\nhawser tows his purpose yet. Believe ye, men, in the things called\\nomens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore! For ere they drown,\\ndrowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to\\nsink for evermore. So with Moby Dick—two days he’s floated—\\ntomorrow will be the third. Aye, men, he’ll rise once more,—but only\\nto spout his last! D’ye feel brave men, brave?”\\n“As fearless fire,” cried Stubb.\\n“And as mechanical,” muttered Ahab. Then as the men went\\nforward, he muttered on: “The things called omens! And yesterday I\\ntalked the same to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh!\\nhow valiantly I seek to drive out of others’ hearts what’s clinched so\\nfast in mine!—The Parsee—the Parsee!—gone, gone? and he was to\\ngo before:—but still was to be seen again ere I could perish—How’s\\nthat?—There’s a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by\\nthe ghosts of the whole line of judges:—like a hawk’s beak it pecks\\nmy brain. I’ll, I’ll solve it, though!”\\nWhen dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.\\nSo once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed\\nnearly as on the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and\\nthe hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men\\ntoiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare\\nboats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow.\\nMeantime, of the broken keel of Ahab’s wrecked craft the carpenter\\nmade him another leg; while still as on the night before, slouched\\nAhab stood fixed within his scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance\\nanticipatingly gone backward on its dial; sat due eastward for the\\nearliest sun.\\nCHAPTER 135. The Chase.—\\nThird Day.\\nThe morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once\\nmore the solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by\\ncrowds of the daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost\\nevery spar.\\n“D’ye see him?” cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.\\n“In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that’s all.\\nHelm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a\\nlovely day again! were it a new-made world, and made for a\\nsummer-house to the angels, and this morning the first of its\\nthrowing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that\\nworld. Here’s food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab\\nnever thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; that’s tingling enough for\\nmortal man! to think’s audacity. God only has that right and\\nprivilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a calmness;\\nand our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for\\nthat. And yet, I’ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm—\\nfrozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the\\ncontents turned to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing\\nnow; this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it’s like\\nthat sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the\\nearthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild\\nwinds blow it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails\\nlash the tossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt\\nblown ere this through prison corridors and cells, and wards of\\nhospitals, and ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as\\ninnocent as fleeces. Out upon it!—it’s tainted. Were I the wind, I’d\\nblow no more on such a wicked, miserable world. I’d crawl\\nsomewhere to a cave, and slink there. And yet, ’tis a noble and\\nheroic thing, the wind! who ever conquered it? In every fight it has\\nthe last and bitterest blow. Run tilting at it, and you but run through\\nit. Ha! a coward wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not\\nstand to receive a single blow. Even Ahab is a braver thing—a\\nnobler thing than that. Would now the wind but had a body; but all\\nthe things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these\\nthings are bodiless, but only bodiless as objects, not as agents.\\nThere’s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious\\ndifference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that there’s\\nsomething all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm Trade\\nWinds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in strong\\nand steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark,\\nhowever the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and\\nmightiest Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about,\\nuncertain where to go at last. And by the eternal Poles! these same\\nTrades that so directly blow my good ship on; these Trades, or\\nsomething like them—something so unchangeable, and full as\\nstrong, blow my keeled soul along! To it! Aloft there! What d’ye\\nsee?”\\n“Nothing, sir.”\\n“Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See\\nthe sun! Aye, aye, it must be so. I’ve oversailed him. How, got the\\nstart? Aye, he’s chasing me now; not I, him—that’s bad; I might have\\nknown it, too. Fool! the lines—the harpoons he’s towing. Aye, aye, I\\nhave run him by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but\\nthe regular look outs! Man the braces!”\\nSteering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the\\nPequod’s quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse\\ndirection, the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she\\nrechurned the cream in her own white wake.\\n“Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw,” murmured\\nStarbuck to himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon\\nthe rail. “God keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me,\\nand from the inside wet my flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my\\nGod in obeying him!”\\n“Stand by to sway me up!” cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen\\nbasket. “We should meet him soon.”\\n“Aye, aye, sir,” and straightway Starbuck did Ahab’s bidding, and\\nonce more Ahab swung on high.\\nA whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself\\nnow held long breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three\\npoints off the weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and\\ninstantly from the three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the\\ntongues of fire had voiced it.\\n“Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On\\ndeck there!—brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind’s eye. He’s\\ntoo far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over\\nthat helmsman with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must\\ndown. But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the\\nsea; there’s time for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so\\nyoung; aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from\\nthe sand-hills of Nantucket! The same!—the same!—the same to\\nNoah as to me. There’s a soft shower to leeward. Such lovely\\nleewardings! They must lead somewhere—to something else than\\ncommon land, more palmy than the palms. Leeward! the white\\nwhale goes that way; look to windward, then; the better if the\\nbitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old mast-head! What’s\\nthis?—green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks. No such\\ngreen weather stains on Ahab’s head! There’s the difference now\\nbetween man’s old age and matter’s. But aye, old mast, we both\\ngrow old together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship?\\nAye, minus a leg, that’s all. By heaven this dead wood has the better\\nof my live flesh every way. I can’t compare with it; and I’ve known\\nsome ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the\\nmost vital stuff of vital fathers. What’s that he said? he should still\\ngo before me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I\\nhave eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those\\nendless stairs? and all night I’ve been sailing from him, wherever he\\ndid sink to. Aye, aye, like many more thou told’st direful truth as\\ntouching thyself, O Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short.\\nGood-bye, mast-head—keep a good eye upon the whale, the while\\nI’m gone. We’ll talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale\\nlies down there, tied by head and tail.”\\nHe gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily\\nlowered through the cloven blue air to the deck.\\nIn due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his\\nshallop’s stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he\\nwaved to the mate,—who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck—\\nand bade him pause.\\n“Starbuck!”\\n“Sir?”\\n“For the third time my soul’s ship starts upon this voyage,\\nStarbuck.”\\n“Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.”\\n“Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,\\nStarbuck!”\\n“Truth, sir: saddest truth.”\\n“Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full\\nof the flood;—and I feel now like a billow that’s all one crested\\ncomb, Starbuck. I am old;—shake hands with me, man.”\\nTheir hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck’s tears the glue.\\n“Oh, my captain, my captain!—noble heart—go not—go not!—\\nsee, it’s a brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the\\npersuasion then!”\\n“Lower away!”—cried Ahab, tossing the mate’s arm from him.\\n“Stand by the crew!”\\nIn an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.\\n“The sharks! the sharks!” cried a voice from the low cabin-window\\nthere; “O master, my master, come back!”\\nBut Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then;\\nand the boat leaped on.\\nYet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship,\\nwhen numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters\\nbeneath the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars,\\nevery time they dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied\\nthe boat with their bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to\\nthe whale-boats in those swarming seas; the sharks at times\\napparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures\\nhover over the banners of marching regiments in the east. But these\\nwere the first sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since\\nthe White Whale had been first descried; and whether it was that\\nAhab’s crew were all such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore\\ntheir flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks—a matter\\nsometimes well known to affect them,—however it was, they\\nseemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others.\\n“Heart of wrought steel!” murmured Starbuck gazing over the\\nside, and following with his eyes the receding boat—“canst thou yet\\nring boldly to that sight?—lowering thy keel among ravening sharks,\\nand followed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the\\ncritical third day?—For when three days flow together in one\\ncontinuous intense pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the\\nsecond the noon, and the third the evening and the end of that\\nthing—be that end what it may. Oh! my God! what is this that\\nshoots through me, and leaves me so deadly calm, yet expectant,—\\nfixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim before me, as in\\nempty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.\\nMary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to see\\nbut thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem\\nclearing; but clouds sweep between—Is my journey’s end coming?\\nMy legs feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,—\\nbeats it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!—stave it off—move, move! speak\\naloud!—Mast-head there! See ye my boy’s hand on the hill?—\\nCrazed;—aloft there!—keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:—mark\\nwell the whale!—Ho! again!—drive off that hawk! see! he pecks—he\\ntears the vane”—pointing to the red flag flying at the main-truck\\n—“Ha! he soars away with it!—Where’s the old man now? see’st\\nthou that sight, oh Ahab!—shudder, shudder!”\\nThe boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-\\nheads—a downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had\\nsounded; but intending to be near him at the next rising, he held\\non his way a little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew\\nmaintaining the profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves\\nhammered and hammered against the opposing bow.\\n“Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads\\ndrive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and\\nno hearse can be mine:—and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!”\\nSuddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles;\\nthen quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged\\nberg of ice, swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was\\nheard; a subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as\\nbedraggled with trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast\\nform shot lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a\\nthin drooping veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the\\nrainbowed air; and then fell swamping back into the deep. Crushed\\nthirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of\\nfountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes, leaving the\\ncircling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the\\nwhale.\\n“Give way!” cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted\\nforward to the attack; but maddened by yesterday’s fresh irons that\\ncorroded in him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all\\nthe angels that fell from heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons\\noverspreading his broad white forehead, beneath the transparent\\nskin, looked knitted together; as head on, he came churning his tail\\namong the boats; and once more flailed them apart; spilling out the\\nirons and lances from the two mates’ boats, and dashing in one side\\nof the upper part of their bows, but leaving Ahab’s almost without a\\nscar.\\nWhile Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks;\\nand as the whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed\\none entire flank as he shot by them again; at that moment a quick\\ncry went up. Lashed round and round to the fish’s back; pinioned in\\nthe turns upon turns in which, during the past night, the whale had\\nreeled the involutions of the lines around him, the half torn body of\\nthe Parsee was seen; his sable raiment frayed to shreds; his\\ndistended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.\\nThe harpoon dropped from his hand.\\n“Befooled, befooled!”—drawing in a long lean breath—“Aye,\\nParsee! I see thee again.—Aye, and thou goest before; and this, this\\nthen is the hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the\\nlast letter of thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to\\nthe ship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time,\\nand return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die—Down, men! the\\nfirst thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that\\nthing I harpoon. Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs;\\nand so obey me.—Where’s the whale? gone down again?”\\nBut he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping\\nwith the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last\\nencounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick\\nwas now again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed\\nthe ship,—which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction\\nto him, though for the present her headway had been stopped. He\\nseemed swimming with his utmost velocity, and now only intent\\nupon pursuing his own straight path in the sea.\\n“Oh! Ahab,” cried Starbuck, “not too late is it, even now, the third\\nday, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that\\nmadly seekest him!”\\nSetting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled\\nto leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was\\nsliding by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck’s face\\nas he leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about,\\nand follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing\\nupwards, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly\\nmounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking\\nin the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side,\\nand were busily at work in repairing them. One after the other,\\nthrough the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses\\nof Stubb and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of\\nnew irons and lances. As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers\\nin the broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into\\nhis heart. But he rallied. And now marking that the vane or flag was\\ngone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had\\njust gained that perch, to descend again for another flag, and a\\nhammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.\\nWhether fagged by the three days’ running chase, and the\\nresistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or\\nwhether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him:\\nwhichever was true, the White Whale’s way now began to abate, as\\nit seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more; though\\nindeed the whale’s last start had not been so long a one as before.\\nAnd still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks\\naccompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat; and so\\ncontinually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became jagged\\nand crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at almost every\\ndip.\\n“Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars.\\nPull on! ’tis the better rest, the shark’s jaw than the yielding water.”\\n“But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!”\\n“They will last long enough! pull on!—But who can tell”—he\\nmuttered—“whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on\\nAhab?—But pull on! Aye, all alive, now—we near him. The helm!\\ntake the helm! let me pass,”—and so saying two of the oarsmen\\nhelped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat.\\nAt length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along\\nwith the White Whale’s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its\\nadvance—as the whale sometimes will—and Ahab was fairly within\\nthe smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale’s spout,\\ncurled round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close\\nto him; when, with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise\\nhigh-lifted to the poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer\\ncurse into the hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the\\nsocket, as if sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed;\\nspasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without\\nstaving a hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it\\nnot been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then\\nclung, Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea. As it\\nwas, three of the oarsmen—who foreknew not the precise instant of\\nthe dart, and were therefore unprepared for its effects—these were\\nflung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the\\ngunwale again, and rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled\\nthemselves bodily inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping\\nastern, but still afloat and swimming.\\nAlmost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,\\ninstantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the\\nweltering sea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take\\nnew turns with the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to\\nturn round on their seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the\\nmoment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug, it\\nsnapped in the empty air!\\n“What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!—’tis whole again; oars!\\noars! Burst in upon him!”\\nHearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale\\nwheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that\\nevolution, catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship;\\nseemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking\\nit—it may be—a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down\\nupon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of\\nfoam.\\nAhab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. “I grow blind;\\nhands! stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is’t\\nnight?”\\n“The whale! The ship!” cried the cringing oarsmen.\\n“Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be\\nfor ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I\\nsee: the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?”\\nBut as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the\\nsledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two\\nplanks burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily\\ndisabled boat lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading,\\nsplashing crew, trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the\\npouring water.\\nMeantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego’s mast-head\\nhammer remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-\\nwrapping him as with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from\\nhim, as his own forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb,\\nstanding upon the bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-\\ncoming monster just as soon as he.\\n“The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers\\nof air, now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a\\nwoman’s fainting fit. Up helm, I say—ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is\\nthis the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities?\\nOh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay!\\nUp helm again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow\\ndrives on towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart. My\\nGod, stand by me now!”\\n“Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will\\nnow help Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou\\ngrinning whale! Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but\\nStubb’s own unwinking eye? And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon\\na mattrass that is all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood!\\nI grin at thee, thou grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I\\ncall ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost.\\nFor all that, I would yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the\\ncup! Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou grinning whale, but there’ll be plenty of\\ngulping soon! Why fly ye not, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket\\nto it; let Stubb die in his drawers! A most mouldy and over salted\\ndeath, though;—cherries! cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask, for one red\\ncherry ere we die!”\\n“Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I\\nhope my poor mother’s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few\\ncoppers will now come to her, for the voyage is up.”\\nFrom the ship’s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive;\\nhammers, bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained\\nin their hands, just as they had darted from their various\\nemployments; all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which\\nfrom side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a\\nbroad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he\\nrushed. Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his\\nwhole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man could do, the solid\\nwhite buttress of his forehead smote the ship’s starboard bow, till\\nmen and timbers reeled. Some fell flat upon their faces. Like\\ndislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their\\nbull-like necks. Through the breach, they heard the waters pour, as\\nmountain torrents down a flume.\\n“The ship! The hearse!—the second hearse!” cried Ahab from the\\nboat; “its wood could only be American!”\\nDiving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its\\nkeel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far\\noff the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab’s boat, where, for\\na time, he lay quiescent.\\n“I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy\\nhammer. Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked\\nkeel; and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm,\\nand Pole-pointed prow,—death-glorious ship! must ye then perish,\\nand without me? Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest\\nshipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel\\nmy topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all\\nyour furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole\\nforegone life, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards\\nthee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I\\ngrapple with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I\\nspit my last breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one\\ncommon pool! and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to\\npieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned\\nwhale! Thus, I give up the spear!”\\nThe harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with\\nigniting velocity the line ran through the grooves;—ran foul. Ahab\\nstooped to clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him\\nround the neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their\\nvictim, he was shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone.\\nNext instant, the heavy eye-splice in the rope’s final end flew out of\\nthe stark-empty tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the\\nsea, disappeared in its depths.\\nFor an instant, the tranced boat’s crew stood still; then turned.\\n“The ship? Great God, where is the ship?” Soon they through dim,\\nbewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the\\ngaseous Fata Morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water;\\nwhile fixed by infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty\\nperches, the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking\\nlookouts on the sea. And now, concentric circles seized the lone\\nboat itself, and all its crew, and each floating oar, and every lance-\\npole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round and round in\\none vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.\\nBut as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over\\nthe sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches\\nof the erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of\\nthe flag, which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the\\ndestroying billows they almost touched;—at that instant, a red arm\\nand a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the\\nact of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A\\nsky-hawk that tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards\\nfrom its natural home among the stars, pecking at the flag, and\\nincommoding Tashtego there; this bird now chanced to intercept its\\nbroad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood; and\\nsimultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the submerged savage\\nbeneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there; and so\\nthe bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak\\nthrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the flag of\\nAhab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to\\nhell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her, and\\nhelmeted herself with it.\\nNow small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a\\nsullen white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and\\nthe great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years\\nago.\\nEpilogue\\n“AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO\\nTELL THEE” Job.\\nThe drama’s done. Why then here does any one step forth?—\\nBecause one did survive the wreck.\\nIt so chanced, that after the Parsee’s disappearance, I was he\\nwhom the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab’s bowsman,\\nwhen that bowsman assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when\\non the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking\\nboat, was dropped astern. So, floating on the margin of the ensuing\\nscene, and in full sight of it, when the halfspent suction of the sunk\\nship reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing\\nvortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool. Round\\nand round, then, and ever contracting towards the button-like black\\nbubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I\\ndid revolve. Till, gaining that vital centre, the black bubble upward\\nburst; and now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring, and,\\nowing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin life-\\nbuoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side.\\nBuoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I\\nfloated on a soft and dirgelike main. The unharming sharks, they\\nglided by as if with padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks\\nsailed with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a sail drew near,\\nnearer, and picked me up at last. It was the devious-cruising Rachel,\\nthat in her retracing search after her missing children, only found\\nanother orphan.\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MOBY DICK; OR, THE\\nWHALE ***\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old\\neditions will be renamed.\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S.\\ncopyright law means that no one owns a United States\\ncopyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can\\ncopy and distribute it in the United States without permission\\nand without paying copyright royalties.
