In his _Journal to Stella_, his social\\nverses, and his letters to his friends, we have a vivid picture of those\\nrelations with women and that protracted suffering which invest with such\\ntragic interest the history of Swift. Pope, by the publication of his own\\ncorrespondence, has enabled us, in a way that he never intended, to\\nunderstand the strange moral twist which distorted a nature by no means\\ndevoid of noble instincts. Johnson was fortunate in the companionship of\\nperhaps the best biographer who ever lived. But of the real life and\\ncharacter of Addison scarcely any contemporary record remains. The formal\\nnarrative prefixed to his works by Tickell is, by that writer\\'s own\\nadmission, little more than a bibliography. Steele, who might have told us\\nmore than any man about his boyhood and his manner of life in London, had\\nbecome estranged from his old friend before his death. No writer has\\ntaken the trouble to preserve any account of the wit and wisdom that\\nenlivened the \"little senate\" at Button\\'s. His own letters are, as a rule,\\ncompositions as finished as his papers in the _Spectator_. Those features\\nin his character which excite the greatest interest have been delineated\\nby the hand of an enemy--an enemy who possessed an unrivalled power of\\nsatirical portrait-painting, and was restrained by no regard for truth\\nfrom creating in the public mind such impressions about others as might\\nserve to heighten the favourable opinion of himself.\\n\\nThis absence of dramatic incident in Addison\\'s life would lead us\\nnaturally to conclude that he was deficient in the energy and passion\\nwhich cause a powerful nature to leave a mark upon its age. Yet such a\\njudgment would certainly be erroneous. Shy and reserved as he was, the\\nunanimous verdict of his most illustrious contemporaries is decisive as to\\nthe respect and admiration which he excited among them. The man who could\\nexert so potent an influence over the mercurial Steele, who could\\nfascinate the haughty and cynical intellect of Swift, whose conversation,\\nby the admission of his satirist Pope, had in it something more charming\\nthan that of any other man; of whom it was said that he might have been\\nchosen king if he wished it; such a man, though to the coarse perception\\nof Mandeville he might have seemed no more than \"a parson in a tye-wig,\"\\ncan hardly have been deficient in force of character.\\n\\nNor would it have been possible for a writer distinguished by mere\\nelegance and refinement to leave a lasting impress on the literature and\\nsociety of his country. In one generation after another, men representing\\nopposing elements of rank, class, interest, and taste, have agreed in\\nacknowledging Addison\\'s extraordinary merits. \"Whoever wishes,\" says\\nJohnson--at the end of a biography strongly coloured with the\\nprepossessions of a semi-Jacobite Tory--\"whoever wishes to attain an\\nEnglish style, familiar but not coarse, and elegant but not ostentatious,\\nmust give his days and nights to the volumes of Addison.\" \"Such a mark of\\nnational respect,\" says Macaulay, the best representative of middle-class\\nopinion in the present century, speaking of the statue erected to Addison\\nin Westminster Abbey, \"was due to the unsullied statesman, to the\\naccomplished scholar, to the master of pure English eloquence, to the\\nconsummate painter of life and manners. It was due, above all, to the\\ngreat satirist who alone knew how to use ridicule without abusing it; who,\\nwithout inflicting a wound, effected a great social reform, and who\\nreconciled wit and virtue after a long and disastrous separation, during\\nwhich wit had been led astray by profligacy, and virtue by fanaticism.\"\\n\\nThis verdict of a great critic is accepted by an age to which the grounds\\nof it are, perhaps, not very apparent. The author of any ideal creation--a\\npoem, a drama, or a novel--has an imprescriptible property in the fame of\\nhis work. But to harmonise conflicting social elements, to bring order out\\nof chaos in the sphere of criticism, to form right ways of thinking about\\nquestions of morals, taste, and breeding, are operations of which the\\ncredit, though it is certainly to be ascribed to particular individuals,\\nis generally absorbed by society itself. Macaulay\\'s eulogy is as just as\\nit is eloquent, but the pages of the _Spectator_ alone will hardly show\\nthe reader why Addison should be so highly praised for having reconciled\\nwit with virtue. Nor, looking at him as a critic, will it appear a great\\nachievement to have pointed out to English society the beauties of\\n_Paradise Lost_, unless it be remembered that the taste of the preceding\\ngeneration still influenced Addison\\'s contemporaries, and that in that\\ngeneration Cowley was accounted a greater poet than Milton.\\n\\nTo estimate Addison at his real value we must regard him as the chief\\narchitect of Public Opinion in the eighteenth century. But here again we\\nare met by an initial difficulty, because it has become almost a\\ncommonplace of contemporary criticism to represent the eighteenth century\\nas a period of sheer destruction. It is tacitly assumed by a school of\\ndistinguished philosophical writers that we have arrived at a stage in the\\nworld\\'s history in which it is possible to take a positive and scientific\\nview of human affairs. As it is of course necessary that from such a\\nsystem all belief in the supernatural shall be jealously excluded, it has\\nnot seemed impossible to write the history of Thought itself in the\\neighteenth century. And in tracing the course of this supposed continuous\\nstream it is natural that all the great English writers of the period\\nshould be described as in one way or another helping to pull down, or\\nvainly to strengthen, the theological barriers erected by centuries of\\nbigotry against the irresistible tide of enlightened progress.\\n\\nIt would be of course entirely out of place to discuss here the merits of\\nthis new school of history. Those who consider that, whatever glimpses we\\nmay obtain of the law and order of the universe, man is, as he always has\\nbeen and always will be, a mystery to himself, will hardly allow that the\\noperations of the human spirit can be traced in the dissecting-room. But\\nit is, in any case, obvious that to treat the great _imaginative_ writers\\nof any age as if they were only mechanical agents in an evolution of\\nthought is to do them grave injustice. Such writers are, above all things,\\ncreative. Their first aim is to \"show the very age and body of the time\\nhis form and pressure.\" No work of the eighteenth century, composed in a\\nconsciously destructive spirit, has taken its place among the acknowledged\\nclassics of the language. Even the _Tale of a Tub_ is to be regarded as a\\nsatire upon the aberrations of theologians from right reason, not upon the\\nprinciples of Christianity itself. The _Essay on Man_ has, no doubt,\\nlogically a tendency towards Deism, but nobody ever read the poem for the\\nsake of its philosophy; and it is well known that Pope was much alarmed\\nwhen it was pointed out to him that his conclusions might be represented\\nas incompatible with the doctrines of revealed religion.\\n\\nThe truth indeed seems to be the exact converse of what is alleged by the\\nscientific historians. So far from the eighteenth century in England being\\nan age of destructive analysis, its energies were chiefly devoted to\\npolitical, social, and literary reconstruction. Whatever revolution in\\nfaith and manners the English nation had undergone had been the work of\\nthe two preceding centuries, and though the historic foundations of\\nsociety remained untouched, the whole form of the superstructure had been\\nprofoundly modified.\\n\\n    \"So tenacious are we,\" said Burke, towards the close of the last\\n    century, \"of our old ecclesiastical modes and fashions of institution\\n    that very little change has been made in them since the fourteenth or\\n    fifteenth centuries, adhering in this particular as in all else to our\\n    old settled maxim never entirely nor at once to depart from antiquity.\\n    We found these institutions on the whole favourable to morality and\\n    discipline, and we thought they were susceptible of amendment without\\n    altering the ground. We thought they were capable of receiving and\\n    meliorating, and, above all, of preserving the accessories of science\\n    and literature as the order of Providence should successively produce\\n    them. And after all, with this Gothic and monkish education (for such\\n    it is the groundwork), we may put in our claim to as ample and early\\n    a share in all the improvements in science, in arts, and in literature\\n    which have illuminated the modern world as any other nation in Europe.\\n    We think one main cause of this improvement was our not despising the\\n    patrimony of knowledge which was left us by our forefathers.\"\\n\\nAll this is, in substance, true of our political as well as our\\necclesiastical institutions. And yet, when Burke wrote, the great feudal\\nand mediæval structure of England had been so transformed by the Wars of\\nthe Roses, the Reformation, the Rebellion, and the Revolution, that its\\nancient outlines were barely visible. In so far, therefore, as his words\\nseem to imply that the social evolution he describes was produced by an\\nimperceptible and almost mechanical process of national instinct, the\\nimpression they tend to create is entirely erroneous.\\n\\nIf we have been hitherto saved from such corruption as undermined the\\nrepublics of Italy, from the religious wars that so long enfeebled and\\ndivided Germany, and from the Revolution that has severed modern France\\nfrom her ancient history, thanks for this are due partly, no doubt, to\\nfavouring conditions of nature and society, but quite as much to the\\ngenius of great individuals who prepared the mind of the nation for the\\ngradual assimilation of new ideas. Thus Langland and Wycliffe and their\\nnumerous followers, long before the Reformation, had so familiarised the\\nminds of the people with their ideas of the Christian religion that the\\nSovereign was able to assume the Headship of the Church without the shock\\nof a social convulsion. Fresh feelings and instincts grew up in the hearts\\nof whole classes of the nation without at first producing any change in\\noutward habits of life, and even without arousing a sense of their logical\\nincongruity. These mixed ideas were constantly brought before the\\nimagination in the works of the poets. Shakespeare abounds with passages\\nin which, side by side with the old feudal, monarchical, catholic, and\\npatriotic instincts of Englishmen, we find the sentiments of the Italian\\nRenaissance. Spenser conveys Puritan doctrines sometimes by the mouth of\\nshepherds, whose originals he had found in Theocritus and Virgil;\\nsometimes under allegorical forms derived from books of chivalry and the\\nceremonial of the Catholic Church. Milton, the most rigidly Calvinistic of\\nall the English poets in his opinions, is also the most severely classical\\nin his style.\\n\\nIt was the task of Addison to carry on the reconciling traditions of our\\nliterature. It is his praise to have accomplished his task under\\nconditions far more difficult than any that his predecessors had\\nexperienced. What they had done was to give instinctive and characteristic\\nexpression to the floating ideas of the society about them; what Addison\\nand his contemporaries did was to found a public opinion by a conscious\\neffort of reason and persuasion. Before the Civil Wars there had been at\\nleast no visible breach in the principle of Authority in Church and State.\\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century constituted authority had been\\nrecently overthrown; one king had been beheaded, another had been\\nexpelled; the Episcopalian form of Church Government had been violently\\ndisplaced in favour of the Presbyterian, and had been with almost equal\\nviolence restored. Whole classes of the population had been drawn into\\nopposing camps during the Civil War, and still stood confronting each\\nother with all the harsh antagonism of sentiment inherited from that\\nconflict. Such a bare summary alone is sufficient to indicate the nature\\nof the difficulties Addison had to encounter in his efforts to harmonise\\npublic opinion; but a more detailed examination of the state of society\\nafter the Restoration is required to place in its full light the\\nextraordinary merits of the success that he achieved.\\n\\nThere was, to begin with, a vehement opposition between town and country.\\nIn the country the old ideas of Feudalism, modified by circumstances, but\\nvigorous and deep-rooted, still prevailed. True, the military system of\\nland-tenure had disappeared with the Restoration, but it was not so with\\nthe relations of life, and the habits of thought and feeling which the\\nsystem had created. The features of surviving Feudalism have been\\ninimitably preserved for us in the character of Sir Roger de Coverley.\\nLiving in the patriarchal fashion, in the midst of tenants and retainers,\\nwho looked up to him as their chief, and for whose welfare and protection\\nhe considered himself responsible, the country gentleman valued above all\\nthings the principle of Loyalty. To the moneyed classes in the towns he\\nwas instinctively opposed; he regarded their interests, both social and\\ncommercial, as contrary to his own; he looked with dislike and suspicion\\non the economical principles of government and conduct on which these\\nclasses naturally rely. Even the younger sons of county families had in\\nAddison\\'s day abandoned the custom, common enough in the feudal times, of\\nseeking their fortune in trade. Many a Will Wimble now spent his whole\\nlife in the country, training dogs for his neighbours, fishing their\\nstreams, making whips for their young heirs, and even garters for their\\nwives and daughters.[1]\\n\\nThe country gentlemen were confirmed in these ideas by the difficulties of\\ncommunication. During his visit to Sir Roger de Coverley the _Spectator_\\nobserved the extreme slowness with which fashions penetrated into the\\ncountry; and he noticed, too, that party spirit was much more violent\\nthere than in the towns. The learning of the clergy, many of whom resided\\nwith the country squires as chaplains, was of course enlisted on the Tory\\nside, and supplied it with arguments which the body of the party might\\nperhaps have found it difficult to discover, or at least to express, for\\nthemselves. For Tory tastes undoubtedly lay generally rather in the\\ndirection of sport than of books. Sir Roger seems to be as much above the\\naverage level of his class as Squire Western is certainly below it:\\nperhaps the Tory fox-hunter of the _Freeholder_, though somewhat\\nsatirically painted, is a fair representative of the society which had its\\nheadquarters at the October Club, and whose favourite poet was Tom\\nD\\'Urfey.\\n\\nThe commercial and professional classes, from whom the Whigs derived their\\nchief support, of course predominated in the towns, and their larger\\nopportunities of association gave them an influence in affairs which\\ncompensated for their inferiority in numbers. They lacked, however, what\\nthe country party possessed, a generous ideal of life. Though many of them\\nwere connected with the Presbyterian system, their common sense made them\\nrevolt from its rigidity, while at the same time their economical\\nprinciples failed to supply them with any standard that could satisfy the\\nimagination. Sir Andrew Freeport excites in us less interest than any\\nmember of the Spectator\\'s Club. There was not yet constituted among the\\nupper middle classes that mixed conception of good feeling, good breeding,\\nand good taste which we now attach to the name of \"gentleman.\"\\n\\nTwo main currents of opinion divided the country, to one of which a man\\nwas obliged to surrender himself if he wished to enjoy the pleasures of\\norganised society. One of these was Puritanism, but this was undoubtedly\\nthe less popular, or at least the less fashionable. A protracted\\nexperience of Roundhead tyranny under the Long Parliament had inclined the\\nnation to believe that almost any form of Government was preferable to\\nthat of the Saints. The Puritan, no longer the mere sectarian, as in the\\ndays of Elizabeth and James I., somewhat ridiculous in the extravagance of\\nhis opinions, but respectable from the constancy with which he maintained\\nthem, had ruled over them as a taskmaster, and had forced them, as far as\\nhe could by military violence, to practise the asceticism to which monks\\nand nuns had voluntarily submitted themselves. The most innocent as well\\nas the most brutal diversions of the people were sacrificed to his\\nspiritual pride. As Macaulay well says, he hated bear-baiting, not because\\nit gave pain to the bear, but because it gave pleasure to the spectator.\\nThe tendency of his creed was, in fact, anti-social. Beauty in his eyes\\nwas a snare, and pleasure a sin; the only mode of social intercourse which\\nhe approved was a sermon.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the habits of the Court, which gave the tone to all\\npolite society, were almost equally distasteful to the instincts of the\\npeople. It was inevitable that the inclinations of Charles II. should be\\nviolently opposed to every sentiment of the Puritans. While he was in the\\npower of the Scots he had been forced into feigned compliance with\\nPresbyterian rites; the Puritans had put his father to death, and had\\ncondemned himself to many years of exile and hardship in Catholic\\ncountries. He had returned to his own land half French in his political\\nand religious sympathies, and entirely so in his literary tastes. To\\nconvert and to corrupt those of his subjects who immediately surrounded\\nhim was an easy matter. \"All by the king\\'s example lived and loved.\"\\nPoets, painters, and actors were forward to promote principles viewed\\nwith favour by their sovereign and not at all disagreeable to themselves.\\nAn ingenious philosopher elevated Absolutism into an intellectual and\\nmoral system, the consequence of which was to encourage the powerful in\\nthe indulgence of every selfish instinct. As the Puritans had oppressed\\nthe country with a system of inhuman religion and transcendental morality,\\nso now, in order to get as far from Puritanism as possible, it seemed\\nnecessary for every one aspiring to be thought a gentleman to avow himself\\nan atheist or a debauchee.\\n\\nThe ideas of the man in the mode after the Restoration are excellently hit\\noff in one of the fictitious letters in the _Spectator_:\\n\\n    \"I am now between fifty and sixty, and had the honour to be well with\\n    the first men of taste and gallantry in the joyous reign of Charles\\n    the Second. As for yourself, Mr. Spectator, you seem with the utmost\\n    arrogance to undermine the very fundamentals upon which we conducted\\n    ourselves. It is monstrous to set up for a man of wit and yet deny\\n    that honour in a woman is anything but peevishness, that inclination\\n    is not the best rule of life, or virtue and vice anything else but\\n    health and disease. We had no more to do but to put a lady in a good\\n    humour, and all we could wish followed of course. Then, again, your\\n    Tully and your discourses of another life are the very bane of mirth\\n    and good humour. Prythee, don\\'t value thyself on thy reason at that\\n    exorbitant rate and the dignity of human nature; take my word for it,\\n    a setting dog has as good reason as any man in England.\"[2]\\n\\nWhile opinions, which from different sides struck at the very roots of\\nsociety, prevailed both in the fashionable and religious portions of the\\ncommunity, it was inevitable that Taste should be hopelessly corrupt. All\\nthe artistic and literary forms which the Court favoured were of the\\nromantic order, but it was romance from which beauty and vitality had\\nutterly disappeared. Of the two great principles of ancient chivalry, Love\\nand Honour, the last notes of which are heard in the lyrics of Lovelace\\nand Montrose, one was now held to be non-existent, and the other was\\nutterly perverted. The feudal spirit had surrounded woman with an\\natmosphere of mystical devotion, but in the reign of Charles II. the\\npassion of love was subjected to the torturing treatment then known as\\n\"wit.\" Cowley and Waller seem to think that when a man is in love the\\nenergy of his feelings is best shown by discovering resemblances between\\nhis mistress and those objects in nature to which she is apparently most\\nunlike.\\n\\nThe ideal of Woman, as she is represented in the _Spectator_, adding\\ngrace, charity, and refinement to domestic life, had still to be created.\\nThe king himself, the presumed mirror of good taste, was notoriously under\\nthe control of his numerous mistresses; and the highest notion of love\\nwhich he could conceive was gallantry. French romances were therefore\\ngenerally in vogue. All the casuistry of love which had been elaborated by\\nMademoiselle de Scudery was reproduced with improvements by Mrs. Aphra\\nBehn. At the same time, as usually happens in diseased societies, there\\nwas a general longing to cultivate the simplicity of the Golden Age, and\\nthe consequence was that no person, even in the lower grades of society,\\nwho pretended to any reading, ever thought of making love in his own\\nperson. The proper tone of feeling was not acquired till he had invested\\nhimself with the pastoral attributes of Damon and Celadon, and had\\naddressed his future wife as Amarantha or Phyllis.\\n\\nThe tragedies of the period illustrate this general inclination to\\nspurious romance. If ever there was a time when the ideal of monarchy was\\ndegraded, and the instincts of chivalrous action discouraged, it was in\\nthe reign of Charles II. Absorbed as he was in the pursuit of pleasure,\\nthe king scarcely attempted to conceal his weariness when obliged to\\nattend to affairs of State. He allowed the Dutch fleet to approach his\\ncapital and to burn his own ships of war on the Thames; he sold Dunkirk to\\nthe French; hardly any action in his life evinces any sense of patriotism\\nor honour. And yet we have only to glance at Johnson\\'s _Life of Dryden_ to\\nsee how all the tragedies of the time turn on the great characters, the\\ngreat actions, the great sufferings of princes. The Elizabethan drama had\\nexhibited man in every degree of life and with every variety of character;\\nthe playwright of the Restoration seldom descended below such themes as\\nthe conquest of Mexico or Granada, the fortunes of the Great Mogul, and\\nthe fate of Hannibal. This monotony of subject was doubtless in part the\\nresult of policy, for in pitying the fortunes of Montezuma the imagination\\nof the spectator insensibly recalled those of Charles the Second.\\n\\nEverything in these tragedies is unreal, strained, and affected. In order\\nto remove them as far as possible from the language of ordinary life they\\nare written in rhyme, while the astonishment of the audience is raised\\nwith big swelling words, which vainly seek to hide the absence of genuine\\nfeeling. The heroes tear their passion to tatters because they think it\\nheroic to do so; their flights into the sublime generally drop into the\\nridiculous; instead of holding up the mirror to nature, their object is to\\ndepart as far as possible from common sense. Nothing exhibits more\\ncharacteristically the utterly artificial feeling, both of the dramatists\\nand the spectators, than the habit which then prevailed of dismissing the\\naudience after a tragic play with a witty epilogue. On one occasion, Nell\\nGwynne, in the character of St. Catherine, was, at the end of the play,\\nleft for dead upon the stage. Her body having to be removed, the actress\\nsuddenly started to her feet, exclaiming,\\n\\n  \"Hold! are you mad? you damned confounded dog,\\n  I am to rise and speak the epilogue!\"[3]\\n\\nBy way of compensation, however, the writers of the period poured forth\\ntheir real feelings without reserve in their comedies. So great, indeed,\\nis the gulf that separates our own manners from theirs, that some critics\\nhave endeavoured to defend the comic dramatists of the Restoration against\\nthe moralists on the ground that their representations of Nature are\\nentirely devoid of reality. Charles Lamb, who loved all curiosities, and\\nthe Caroline comedians among the number, says of them:\\n\\n    \"They are a world of themselves almost as much as fairy-land. Take one\\n    of their characters, male or female (with few exceptions they are\\n    alike), and place it in a modern play, and my virtuous indignation\\n    shall rise against the profligate wretch as warmly as the Catos of the\\n    pit could desire, because in a modern play I am to judge of the right\\n    and the wrong. The standard of _police_ is the measure of _political\\n    justice_. The atmosphere will blight it; it cannot live here. It has\\n    got into a moral world, where it has no business, from which it must\\n    needs fall headlong--as dizzy and incapable of making a stand as a\\n    Swedenborgian bad spirit that has wandered unawares into his sphere of\\n    Good Men or Angels. But in its own world do we feel the creature is so\\n    very bad? The Fainalls and Mirabels, the Dorimants and Lady\\n    Touchwoods, in their own sphere do not offend my moral sense; in fact,\\n    they do not appeal to it at all. They seem engaged in their proper\\n    element. They break through no laws or conscientious restraints. They\\n    know of none. They have got out of Christendom into the land of-what\\n    shall I call it?--of cuckoldry--the Utopia of gallantry, where\\n    pleasure is duty and the manners perfect freedom. It is altogether a\\n    speculative scene of things, which has no reference whatever to the\\n    world that is.\"\\n\\nThis is a very happy description of the manner in which the plays of\\nEtherege, Shadwell, Wycherley, and Congreve affect us to-day; and it is no\\ndoubt superfluous to expend much moral indignation on works which have\\nlong since lost their power to charm: comedies in which the reader finds\\nneither the horseplay of Aristophanes, nor the nature of Terence, nor the\\npoetry of Shakespeare; in which there is not a single character that\\narouses interest, or a situation that spontaneously provokes laughter; in\\nwhich the complications of plot are produced by the devices of fine\\ngentlemen for making cuckolds of citizens, and the artifices of wives to\\ndupe their husbands; in which the profuse wit of the dialogue might excite\\nadmiration, if it were possible to feel the smallest interest in the\\noccasion that produced it. But to argue that these plays never represented\\nany state of existing society is a paradox which chooses to leave out of\\naccount the contemporary attack on the stage made by Jeremy Collier, the\\nadmissions of Dryden, and all those valuable glimpses into the manners of\\nour ancestors which are afforded by the prologues of the period.\\n\\nIt is sufficient to quote against Lamb the witty and severe criticism of\\nSteele in the _Spectator_, upon Etherege\\'s _Man of the Mode_:\\n\\n    \"It cannot be denied but that the negligence of everything which\\n    engages the attention of the sober and valuable part of mankind\\n    appears very well drawn in this piece. But it is denied that it is\\n    necessary to the character of a fine gentleman that he should in that\\n    manner trample upon all order and decency. As for the character of\\n    Dorimant, it is more of a coxcomb than that of Fopling. He says of one\\n    of his companions that a good correspondence between them is their\\n    mutual interest. Speaking of that friend, he declares their being much\\n    together \\'makes the women think the better of his understanding, and\\n    judge more favourably of my reputation. It makes him pass upon some\\n    for a man of very good sense, and me upon others for a very civil\\n    person.\\' This whole celebrated piece is a perfect contradiction to\\n    good manners, good sense, and common honesty; and as there is nothing\\n    in it but what is built upon the ruin of virtue and innocence,\\n    according to the notion of virtue in this comedy, I take the shoemaker\\n    to be in reality the fine gentleman of the play; for it seems he is an\\n    atheist, if we may depend upon his character as given by the\\n    orange-woman, who is herself far from being the lowest in the play.\\n    She says of a fine man who is Dorimant\\'s companion, \\'there is not such\\n    another heathen in the town except the shoemaker.\\' His pretension to\\n    be the hero of the drama appears still more in his own description of\\n    his way of living with his lady. \\'There is,\\' says he, \\'never a man in\\n    the town lives more like a gentleman with his wife than I do. I never\\n    mind her motions; she never inquires into mine. We speak to one\\n    another civilly; hate one another heartily; and, because it is vulgar\\n    to lie and soak together, we have each of us our several settle-beds.\\'\\n\\n    \"That of \\'soaking together\\' is as good as if Dorimant had spoken it\\n    himself; and I think, since he puts human nature in as ugly a form as\\n    the circumstances will bear, and is a staunch unbeliever, he is very\\n    much wronged in having no part of the good fortune bestowed in the\\n    last act. To speak plain of this whole work, I think nothing but being\\n    lost to a sense of innocence and virtue can make any one see this\\n    comedy without observing more frequent occasion to move sorrow and\\n    indignation than mirth and laughter. At the same time I allow it to be\\n    nature, but it is nature in its utmost corruption and degeneracy.\"[4]\\n\\nThe truth is, that the stage after the Restoration reflects only too\\nfaithfully the manners and the sentiments of the only society which at\\nthat period could boast of anything like organisation. The press, which\\nnow enables public opinion to exercise so powerful a control over the\\nmanners of the times, had then scarcely an existence. No standard of\\nfemale honour restrained the license of wit and debauchery. If the clergy\\nwere shocked at the propagation of ideas so contrary to the whole spirit\\nof Christianity, their natural impulse to reprove them was checked by the\\nfear that an apparent condemnation of the practices of the Court might end\\nin the triumph of their old enemies, the Puritans. All the elements of an\\nold and decaying form of society that tended to atheism, cynicism, and\\ndissolute living, exhibited themselves, therefore, in naked shamelessness\\non the stage. The audiences in the theatres were equally devoid of good\\nmanners and good taste; they did not hesitate to interrupt the actors in\\nthe midst of a serious play, while they loudly applauded their obscene\\nallusions. So gross was the character of comic dialogue that women could\\nnot venture to appear at a comedy without masks, and under these\\ncircumstances the theatre became the natural centre for assignations. In\\nsuch an atmosphere women readily cast off all modesty and reserve; indeed,\\nthe choicest indecencies of the times are to be found in the epilogues to\\nthe plays, which were always assigned to the female actors.\\n\\nIt at first sight seems remarkable that a society inveterately corrupt\\nshould have contained in itself such powers of purification and vitality\\nas to discard the literary garbage of the Restoration period in favour of\\nthe refined sobriety which characterises the writers of Queen Anne\\'s\\nreign. But, in fact, the spread of the infection was confined within\\ncertain well-marked limits. The Court moved in a sphere apart, and was\\naltogether too light and frivolous to exert a decided moral influence on\\nthe great body of the nation. The country gentlemen, busied on their\\nestates, came seldom to town; the citizens, the lawyers, and the members\\nof the other professions steadily avoided the theatre, and regarded with\\nequal contempt the moral and literary excesses of the courtiers. Among\\nthis class, unrepresented at present in the world of letters, except,\\nperhaps, by antiquarians like Selden, the foundations of sound taste were\\nbeing silently laid. The readers of the nation had hitherto been almost\\nlimited to the nobility. Books were generally published by subscription,\\nand were dependent for their success on the favour with which they were\\nreceived by the courtiers. But, after the subsidence of the Civil War, the\\nnation began to make rapid strides in wealth and refinement, and the\\nmoneyed classes sought for intellectual amusement in their leisure hours.\\nAuthors by degrees found that they might look for readers beyond the\\nselect circle of their aristocratic patrons; and the book-seller, who had\\nhitherto calculated his profits merely by the commission he might obtain\\non the sale of books, soon perceived that they were becoming valuable as\\nproperty. The reign of Charles II. is remarkable not only for the great\\nincrease in the number of the licensed printers in London, but for the\\nappearance of the first of the race of modern publishers, Jacob Tonson.\\n\\nThe portion of society whose tastes the publishers undertook to satisfy\\nwas chiefly interested in history, poetry, and criticism. It was this for\\nwhich Dryden composed his _Miscellany_, this to which he addressed the\\nadmirable critical essays which precede his _Translations from the Latin\\nPoets_ and his _Versifications of Chaucer_, and this which afterwards gave\\nthe main support to the _Tatler_ and the _Spectator_. Ignorant of the\\nwritings of the great classical authors, as well as of the usages of\\npolite society, these men were nevertheless robust and manly in their\\nideas, and were eager to form for themselves a correct standard of taste\\nby reference to the best authorities. Though they turned with repugnance\\nfrom the playhouse and from the morals of the Court, they could not\\navoid being insensibly affected by the tone of grace and elegance which\\nprevailed in Court circles. And in this respect, if in no other, our\\ngratitude is due to the Caroline dramatists, who may justly claim to be\\nthe founders of the _social_ prose style in English literature. Before\\nthem English prose had been employed, no doubt, with music and majesty by\\nmany writers; but the style of these is scarcely representative; they had\\nused the language for their own elevated purposes, without, however,\\nattempting to give it that balanced fineness and subtlety which makes it a\\nfitting instrument for conveying the complex ideas of an advanced stage of\\nsociety. Dryden, Wycherley, and their followers, impelled by the taste of\\nthe Court to study the French language, brought to English composition a\\nnicer standard of logic and a more choice selection of language, while the\\nnecessity of pleasing their audiences with brilliant dialogue made them\\ncareful to give their sentences that well-poised structure which Addison\\nafterwards carried to perfection in the _Spectator_.\\n\\nBy this brief sketch the reader may be enabled to judge of the distracted\\nstate of society, both in politics and taste, in the reign of Charles II.\\nOn the one side, the Monarchical element in the Constitution was\\nrepresented by the Court Party, flushed with the recent restoration;\\nretaining the old ideas and principles of absolutism which had prevailed\\nunder James I., without being able to perceive their inapplicability to\\nthe existing nature of things; feeding its imagination alternately on\\nsentiments derived from the decayed spirit of chivalry, and on artistic\\nrepresentations of fashionable debauchery in its most open form--a party\\nwhich, while it fortunately preserved the traditions of wit, elegance, and\\ngaiety of style, seemed unaware that these qualities could be put to any\\nother use than the mitigation of an intolerable _ennui_. On the other\\nside, the rising power of Democracy found its representatives in austere\\nRepublicans opposed to all institutions in Church and State that seemed to\\nobstruct their own abstract principles of government; gloomy fanatics,\\nwho, with an intense intellectual appreciation of eternal principles of\\nreligion and morality, sought to sacrifice to their system the most\\npermanent and even innocent instincts of human nature. Between the two\\nextreme parties was the unorganised body of the nation, grouped round old\\ncustoms and institutions, rapidly growing in wealth and numbers, conscious\\nof the rise in their midst of new social principles, but perplexed how to\\nreconcile these with time-honoured methods of religious, political, and\\nliterary thought. To lay the foundations of sound opinion among the people\\nat large; to prove that reconciliation was possible between principles\\nhitherto exhibited only in mutual antagonism; to show that under the\\nEnglish Constitution monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy might all be\\nharmonised, that humanity was not absolutely incompatible with religion or\\nmorality with art, was the task of the statesmen, and still more of the\\nmen of letters, of the early part of the eighteenth century.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nADDISON\\'S FAMILY AND EDUCATION.\\n\\n\\nJoseph Addison was born on the 1st of May, 1672. He was the eldest son of\\nLancelot Addison, at the time of his birth rector of Milston, near\\nAmesbury, in Wiltshire, and afterwards Dean of Lichfield. His father was a\\nman of character and accomplishments. Educated at Oxford, while that\\nUniversity was under the control of the famous Puritan Visitation, he made\\nno secret of his contempt for principles to which he was forced to submit,\\nor of his preferences for Monarchy and Episcopacy. His boldness was not\\nagreeable to the University authorities, and being forced to leave Oxford,\\nhe maintained himself for a time near Petworth, in Sussex, by acting as\\nchaplain or tutor in families attached to the Royalist cause. After the\\nRestoration he obtained the appointment of chaplain to the garrison of\\nDunkirk, and when that town was ceded to France in 1662, he was removed in\\na similar capacity to Tangier. Here he remained eight years, but,\\nventuring on a visit to England, his post was bestowed upon another, and\\nhe would have been left without resources had not one of his friends\\npresented him with the living of Milston, valued at £120 a year. With the\\ncourage of his order he thereupon took a wife, Jane, daughter of Dr.\\nNathaniel Gulston, and sister of William Gulston, Bishop of Bristol, by\\nwhom he had six children, three sons and three daughters, all born at\\nMilston. In 1675 he was made a prebendary of Salisbury Cathedral and\\nChaplain-in-Ordinary to the King; and in 1683 he was promoted to the\\nDeanery of Lichfield, as a reward for his services at Tangier, and out of\\nconsideration of losses which he had sustained by a fire at Milston. His\\nliterary reputation stood high, and it is said that he would have been\\nmade a bishop, if his old zeal for legitimacy had not prompted him to\\nmanifest in the Convocation of 1689 his hostility to the Revolution. He\\ndied in 1703.\\n\\nLancelot was a writer at once voluminous and lively. In the latter part of\\nhis life he produced several treatises on theological subjects, the most\\npopular of which was called _An Introduction to the Sacrament_. This book\\npassed through many editions. The doctrine it contains leans rather to the\\nLow Church side. But much the most characteristic of his writings were his\\nworks on Mahommedanism and Judaism, the results of his studies during his\\nresidence in Barbary. These show not only considerable industry and\\nresearch and powers of shrewd observation, but that genuine literary\\nfaculty which enables a writer to leave upon a subject of a general nature\\nthe impression of his own character. While there is nothing forced or\\nexaggerated in his historical style, a vein of allegory runs through the\\nnarrative of the _Revolutions of the Kingdoms of Fez and Morocco_, which\\nmust have had a piquant flavour for the orthodox English reader of that\\nday. Recollections of the Protectorate would have taken nothing of its\\nvividness from the portrait of the Moorish priest who \"began to grow into\\nreputation with the people by reason of his high pretensions to piety and\\nfervent zeal for their law, illustrated by a stubborn rigidity of\\nconversation and outward sanctity of life.\" When the Zeriffe, with\\nambitious designs on the throne, sent his sons on a pilgrimage to Mecca,\\nthe religious buffooneries practised by the young men must have recalled\\nto the reader circumstances more recent and personal than those which the\\nauthor was apparently describing. \"Much was the reverence and reputation\\nof holiness which they thereby acquired among the superstitious people,\\nwho could hardly be kept from kissing their garments and adoring them as\\nsaints, while they failed not in their parts, but acted as much devotion\\nas high contemplative looks, deep sighs, tragical gestures, and other\\npassionate interjections of holiness could express. \\'Allah, allah!\\' was\\ntheir doleful note, their sustenance the people\\'s alms.\" And when these\\nimpostors had inveigled the King of Fez into a religious war, the\\ndescription of those who \"mistrusted their own safety, and began, but too\\nlate, to repent their approving of an armed hypocrisy,\" was not more\\napplicable to the rulers of Barbary than to the people of England. \"Puffed\\nup with their successes, they forgot their obedience, and these saints\\ndenied the king the fifth part of their spoils.... By which it appeared\\nthat they took up arms, not out of love for their country and zeal for\\ntheir religion, but out of desire of rule.\" There is, indeed, nothing in\\nthese utterances which need have prevented the writer from consistently\\npromoting the Revolution of 1688; yet his principles seem to have carried\\nhim far in the opposite direction; and it is interesting to remember that\\nthe assertor in Convocation of the doctrine of indefeasible hereditary\\nright was the father of the author of the _Whig Examiner_ and the\\n_Freeholder_. However decidedly Joseph may have dissented from his\\nfather\\'s political creed, we know that he entertained admiration and\\nrespect for his memory, and that death alone prevented him from\\ncompleting the monument afterwards erected in Lancelot\\'s honour in\\nLichfield Cathedral.\\n\\nOf Addison\\'s mother nothing of importance is recorded. His second brother,\\nGulston, became Governor of Fort St. George, in the East Indies; and the\\nthird, Lancelot, followed in Joseph\\'s footsteps so far as to obtain a\\nFellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford. His sisters, Jane and Anna, died\\nyoung; but Dorothy was twice married, and Swift records in her honour that\\nshe was \"a kind of wit, and very like her brother.\" We may readily believe\\nthat a writer so lively as Lancelot would have had clever children, but\\nSteele was perhaps carried away by the zeal of friendship or the love of\\nepigram when he said, in his dedication to the _Drummer_: \"Mr. Dean\\nAddison left behind him four children, each of whom, for excellent talents\\nand singular perfections, was as much above the ordinary world as their\\nbrother Joseph was above them.\" But that Steele had a sincere admiration\\nfor the whole family is sufficiently shown by his using them as an example\\nin one of his early _Tatlers_:\\n\\n    \"I remember among all my acquaintance but one man whom I have thought\\n    to live with his children with equanimity and a good grace. He had\\n    three sons and one daughter, whom he bred with all the care imaginable\\n    in a liberal and ingenuous way. I have often heard him say he had the\\n    weakness to love one much better than the other, but that he took as\\n    much pains to correct that as any other criminal passion that could\\n    arise in his mind. His method was to make it the only pretension in\\n    his children to his favour to be kind to each other, and he would tell\\n    them that he who was the best brother he would reckon the best son.\\n    This turned their thoughts into an emulation for the superiority in\\n    kind and tender affection towards each other. The boys behaved\\n    themselves very early with a manly friendship; and their sister,\\n    instead of the gross familiarities and impertinent freedoms in\\n    behaviour usual in other houses, was always treated by them with as\\n    much complaisance as any other young lady of their acquaintance. It\\n    was an unspeakable pleasure to visit or sit at a meal in that family.\\n    I have often seen the old man\\'s heart flow at his eyes with joy upon\\n    occasions which would appear indifferent to such as were strangers to\\n    the turn of his mind; but a very slight accident, wherein he saw his\\n    children\\'s good-will to one another, created in him the god-like\\n    pleasure of loving them because they loved each other. This great\\n    command of himself in hiding his first impulse to partiality at last\\n    improved to a steady justice towards them, and that which at first was\\n    but an expedient to correct his weakness was afterwards the measure of\\n    his virtue.\"[5]\\n\\nThis, no doubt, is the set description of a moralist, and to an age in\\nwhich the liberty of manners has grown into something like license it may\\nsavour of formalism and priggishness; but when we remember that the writer\\nwas one of the most warm-hearted of men, and that the subject of his\\npanegyric was himself, full of vivacity and impulse, it must be admitted\\nthat the picture which it gives us of the Addison family in the rectory of\\nMilston is a particularly amiable one.\\n\\nThough the eighteenth century had little of that feeling for natural\\nbeauty which distinguishes our own, a man of Addison\\'s imagination could\\nhardly fail to be impressed by the character of the scenery in which his\\nchildhood was passed. No one who has travelled on a summer\\'s day across\\nSalisbury plain, with its vast canopy of sky and its open tracts of\\nundulating downland, relieved by no shadows except such as are thrown by\\nthe passing cloud, the grazing sheep, and the great circle of Stonehenge,\\nwill forget the delightful sense of refreshment and repose produced by the\\ndescent into the valley of the Avon. The sounds of human life rising from\\nthe villages after the long solitude of the plain, the shade of the deep\\nwoods, the coolness of the river, like all streams rising in the chalk,\\nclear and peaceful, are equally delicious to the sense and the\\nimagination. It was, doubtless, the recollection of these scenes that\\ninspired Addison in his paraphrase of the twenty-third Psalm:\\n\\n  \"The Lord my pasture shall prepare,\\n  And feed me with a shepherd\\'s care.\\n\\n     *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n  When in the sultry glebe I faint,\\n  Or on the thirsty mountain pant,\\n  To fertile vales and dewy meads\\n  My weary wandering steps he leads,\\n  Where peaceful rivers, soft and slow,\\n  Amid the verdant landscape flow.\"\\n\\nAt Amesbury he was first sent to school, his master being one Nash; and\\nhere, too, he probably met with the first recorded adventure of his life.\\nIt is said that having committed some fault, and being fearful of the\\nconsequences, he ran away from school, and, taking up his abode in a\\nhollow tree, maintained himself as he could till he was discovered and\\nbrought back to his parents. He was removed from Amesbury to Salisbury,\\nand thence to the Grammar School at Lichfield, where he is said to have\\nbeen the leader in a \"barring out.\" From Lichfield he passed to the\\nCharter House, then under the charge of Dr. Ellis, a man of taste and\\nscholarship. The Charter House at that period was, after Westminster, the\\nbest-known school in England, and here was laid the foundation of that\\nsound classical taste which perfected the style of the essays in the\\n_Spectator_.\\n\\nMacaulay labours with much force and ingenuity to prove that Addison\\'s\\nclassical acquirements were only superficial, and, in his usual\\nepigrammatic manner, hazards the opinion that \"his knowledge of Greek,\\nthough doubtless such as was, in his time, thought respectable at Oxford,\\nwas evidently less than that which many lads now carry away every year\\nfrom Eton and Rugby.\" That Addison was not a scholar of the class of\\nBentley or Porson may be readily admitted. But many scattered allusions in\\nhis works prove that his acquaintance with the Greek poets of every\\nperiod, if cursory, was wide and intelligent: he was sufficiently master\\nof the language thoroughly to understand the spirit of what he read; he\\nundertook while at Oxford a translation of Herodotus, and one of the\\npapers in the _Spectator_ is a direct imitation of a _jeu d\\'esprit_ of\\nLucian\\'s. The Eton or Rugby boy who, in these days, with a normal appetite\\nfor cricket and football, acquired an equal knowledge of Greek literature,\\nwould certainly be somewhat of a prodigy.\\n\\nNo doubt, however, Addison\\'s knowledge of the Latin poets was, as Macaulay\\ninfers, far more extensive and profound. It would have been strange had it\\nbeen otherwise. The influence of the classical side of the Italian\\nRenaissance was now at its height, and wherever those ideas became\\nparamount Latin composition was held in at least as much esteem as poetry\\nin the vernacular. Especially was this the case in England, where certain\\naffinities of character and temperament made it easy for writers to adopt\\nRoman habits of thought. Latin verse composition soon took firm root in\\nthe public schools and universities, so that clever boys of the period\\nwere tolerably familiar with most of the minor Roman poets. Pope, in the\\nFourth Book of the _Dunciad_, vehemently attacked the tradition as\\nconfining the mind to the study of words rather than of things; but he had\\nhimself had no experience of a public school, and only those who fail to\\nappreciate the influence of Latin verse composition on the style of our\\nown greatest orators, and of poets like Milton and Gray, will be inclined\\nto undervalue it as an instrument of social and literary training.\\n\\nProficiency in this art may at least be said to have laid the foundation\\nof Addison\\'s fortunes. Leaving the Charter House in 1687, at the early age\\nof fifteen, he was entered at Queen\\'s College, Oxford, and remained a\\nmember of that society for two years, when a copy of his Latin verses fell\\ninto the hands of Dr. Lancaster, then Fellow and afterwards Provost of the\\nCollege. Struck with their excellence, Lancaster used his influence to\\nobtain for him a demyship at Magdalen. The subject of this fortunate set\\nof verses was \"Inauguratio Regis Gulielmi,\" from which fact we may\\nreasonably infer that even in his boyhood his mind had acquired a Whig\\nbias. Whatever inclination he may have had in this direction would have\\nbeen confirmed by the associations of his new college. The fluctuations of\\nopinion in Magdalen had been frequent and extraordinary. Towards the close\\nof Elizabeth\\'s reign it was notorious for its Calvinism, but under the\\nChancellorship of Laud it appears to have adopted, with equal ardour, the\\ncause of Arminianism, for it was among the colleges that offered the\\nstoutest opposition to the Puritan visitors in 1647-48. The despotic\\ntendencies of James II., however, again cooled its loyalty, and its\\nspirited resistance to the king\\'s order for the election of a Roman\\nCatholic President had given a mortal blow to the Stuart dynasty. Hough\\nwas now President, but in consequence of the dispute with the king there\\nhad been no election of demies in 1688, so that twice the usual number was\\nchosen in the following year, and the occasion was distinguished by the\\nname of the \"golden election.\" From Magdalen Addison proceeded to his\\nmaster\\'s degree in 1693; the College elected him probationary Fellow in\\n1697, and actual Fellow the year after. He retained his Fellowship till\\n1711.\\n\\nOf his tastes, habits, and friendships at Oxford there are few records.\\nAmong his acquaintance were Boulter, afterwards Archbishop of\\nDublin--whose memory is unenviably perpetuated, in company with Ambrose\\nPhillips, in Pope\\'s _Epistle to Arbuthnot_,\\n\\n  \"Does not one table Bavius still admit,\\n  Still to one Bishop Phillips seem a wit?\"--\\n\\nand possibly the famous Sacheverell.[6] He is said to have shown in the\\nsociety of Magdalen some of the shyness that afterwards distinguished him;\\nhe kept late hours, and read chiefly after dinner. The walk under the\\nwell-known elms by the Cherwell is still connected with his name. Though\\nhe probably acted as tutor in the college, the greater part of his quiet\\nlife at the University was doubtless occupied in study. A proof of his\\nearly maturity is seen in the fact that, in his nineteenth year, a young\\nman of birth and fortune, Mr. Rushout, who was being educated at Magdalen,\\nwas placed under his charge.\\n\\nHis reputation as a scholar and a man of taste soon extended itself to the\\nworld of letters in London. In 1693, being then in his twenty-second year,\\nhe wrote his _Account of the Greatest English Poets_; and about the same\\ntime he addressed a short copy of verses to Dryden, complimenting him on\\nthe enduring vigour of his poetical faculty, as shown in his translations\\nof Virgil and other Latin poets, some of which had recently appeared in\\nTonson\\'s _Miscellany_. The old poet appears to have been highly gratified,\\nand to have welcomed the advances thus made to him, for he returned\\nAddison\\'s compliment by bestowing high and not unmerited praise on the\\ntranslation of the Fourth Book of the _Georgics_, which the latter soon\\nafter undertook, and by printing, as a preface to his own translation, a\\ndiscourse written by Addison on the _Georgics_, as well as arguments to\\nmost of the books of the _Æneid_.\\n\\nThrough Dryden, no doubt, he became acquainted with Jacob Tonson. The\\nfather of English publishing had for some time been a well-known figure in\\nthe literary world. He had purchased the copyright of _Paradise Lost_; he\\nhad associated himself with Dryden in publishing before the Revolution two\\nvolumes of _Miscellanies_; encouraged by the success which these obtained,\\nhe put the poet, in 1693, on some translations of Juvenal and Persius, and\\ntwo new volumes of _Miscellanies_; while in 1697 he urged him to undertake\\na translation of the whole of the works of Virgil. Observing how strongly\\nthe public taste set towards the great classical writers, he was anxious\\nto employ men of ability in the work of turning them into English; and it\\nappears from existing correspondence that he engaged Addison, while the\\nlatter was at Oxford, to superintend a translation of Herodotus. He also\\nsuggested a translation of Ovid. Addison undertook to procure coadjutors\\nfor the work of translating the Greek historian. He himself actually\\ntranslated the books called _Polymnia_ and _Urania_, but for some\\nunexplained reason the work was never published. For Ovid he seems, on the\\nwhole, to have had less inclination. At Tonson\\'s instance he translated\\nthe Second Book of the _Metamorphoses_, which was first printed in the\\nvolume of _Miscellanies_ that appeared in 1697; but he wrote to the\\npublisher that \"Ovid had so many silly stories with his good ones that he\\nwas more tedious to translate than a better poet would be.\" His study of\\nOvid, however, was of the greatest use in developing his critical faculty;\\nthe excesses and want of judgment in that poet forced him to reflect, and\\nhis observations on the style of his author anticipate his excellent\\nremarks on the difference between True and False Wit in the sixty-second\\nnumber of the _Spectator_.\\n\\nWhoever, indeed, compares these notes with the _Essay on the Georgics_,\\nand with the opinions expressed in the _Account of the English Poets_,\\nwill be convinced that the foundations of his critical method were laid at\\nthis period (1697). In the _Essay on the Georgics_ he seems to be timid in\\nthe presence of Virgil\\'s superiority; his _Account of the English Poets_,\\nbesides being impregnated with the principles of taste prevalent after the\\nRestoration, shows deficient powers of perception and appreciation. The\\nname of Shakespeare is not mentioned in it, Dryden and Congreve alone\\nbeing selected to represent the drama. Chaucer is described as \"a merry\\nbard,\" whose humour has become obsolete through time and change; while the\\nrich pictorial fancy of the _Faery Queen_ is thus described:\\n\\n  \"Old Spenser next, warmed with poetic rage,\\n  In ancient tales amused a barbarous age--\\n  An age that yet uncultivate and rude,\\n  Where\\'er the poet\\'s fancy led pursued,\\n  Through pathless fields and unfrequented floods,\\n  To dens of dragons and enchanted woods.\\n  But now the mystic tale, that pleased of yore,\\n  Can charm an understanding age no more;\\n  The long-spun allegories fulsome grow,\\n  While the dull moral lies too plain below.\"\\n\\nAccording to Pope--always a suspicious witness where Addison is\\nconcerned--he had not read Spenser when he wrote this criticism on him.[7]\\n\\nMilton, as a legitimate successor of the classics, is of course\\nappreciated, but not at all after the elaborate fashion of the\\n_Spectator_; to Dryden, the most distinguished poet of the day, deserved\\ncompliments are paid, but their value is lessened by the exaggerated\\nopinion which the writer entertains of Cowley, who is described as a\\n\"mighty genius,\" and is praised for the inexhaustible riches of his\\nimagination. Throughout the poem, in fact, we observe a remarkable\\nconfusion of various veins of thought; an unjust depreciation of the\\nGothic grandeur of the older English poets; a just admiration for the\\nGreek and Roman authors; a sense of the necessity of good sense and\\nregularity in writings composed for an \"understanding age;\" and at the\\nsame time a lingering taste for the forced invention and far-fetched\\nconceits that mark the decay of the spirit of mediæval chivalry.\\n\\nWith the judgments expressed in this performance it is instructive to\\ncompare such criticisms on Shakespeare as we find in No. 42 of the\\n_Spectator_, the papers on \"Chevy Chase\" (73, 74), and particularly the\\nfollowing passage:\\n\\n    \"As true wit consists in the resemblance of ideas, and false wit in\\n    the resemblance of words, according to the foregoing instances, there\\n    is another kind of wit which consists partly in the resemblance of\\n    ideas and partly in the resemblance of words, which, for distinction\\'s\\n    sake, I shall call mixed wit. This kind of wit is that which abounds\\n    in Cowley more than in any author that ever wrote. Mr. Waller has\\n    likewise a great deal of it. Mr. Dryden is very sparing in it. Milton\\n    has a genius much above it. _Spenser is in the same class with\\n    Milton._ The Italians even in their epic poetry are full of it.\\n    Monsieur Boileau, who formed himself upon the ancient poets, has\\n    everywhere rejected it with scorn. If we look after mixed wit among\\n    the Greeks, we shall find it nowhere but in the epigrammatists. There\\n    are, indeed, some strokes of it in the little poem ascribed to Musæus,\\n    which by that, as well as many other marks, betrays itself to be a\\n    modern composition. If we look into the Latin writers we find none of\\n    this mixed wit in Virgil, Lucretius, or Catullus; very little in\\n    Horace, but a great deal of it in Ovid, and scarce anything else in\\n    Martial.\"\\n\\nThe stepping-stone from the immaturity of the early criticisms in the\\n_Account of the Greatest English Poets_ to the finished ease of the\\n_Spectator_ is to be found in the notes to the translation of Ovid.[8]\\n\\nThe time came when he was obliged to form a decision affecting the entire\\ncourse of his life. Tonson, who had a wide acquaintance, no doubt\\nintroduced him to Congreve and the leading men of letters in London, and\\nthrough them he was presented to Somers and Montague. Those ministers\\nperhaps persuaded him, as a point of etiquette, to write, in 1695, his\\n_Address to King William_, a poem composed in a vein of orthodox\\nhyperbole, all of which must have been completely thrown away on that most\\nunpoetical of monarchs. Yet in spite of those seductions Addison lingered\\nat Oxford. To retain his Fellowship it was necessary for him to take\\norders. Had he done so, there can be no doubt that his literary skill and\\nhis value as a political partizan would have opened for him a road to the\\nhighest preferment. At that time the clergy were far from thinking it\\nunbecoming to their cloth to fight in the political arena or to take part\\nin journalism. Swift would have been advanced to a bishopric, as a reward\\nfor his political services, if it had not been for the prejudice\\nentertained towards him by Queen Anne; Boulter, rector of St. Saviour\\'s,\\nSouthwark, having made himself conspicuous by editing a paper called the\\n_Freethinker_, was raised to the Primacy of Ireland; Hoadley, the\\nnotorious Bishop of Bangor, edited the _London Journal_; the honours that\\nwere awarded to two men of such second-rate intellectual capacity would\\nhardly have been denied to Addison. He was inclined in this direction by\\nthe example and advice of his father, who was now Dean of Lichfield, and\\nwho was urgent on his son to rid himself of the pecuniary embarrassments\\nin which he was involved by embracing the Church as a profession. A few\\nyears before he had himself seemed to look upon the Church as his future\\nsphere. In his _Account of the Greatest English Poets_ he says:\\n\\n  \"I leave the arts of poetry and verse\\n  To them that practise them with more success.\\n  Of greater truths I\\'ll now propose to tell,\\n  And so at once, dear friend and muse, farewell.\"\\n\\nHad he followed up his intention we might have known the name of Addison\\nas that of an artful controversialist, and perhaps as a famous writer of\\nsermons; but we should, in all probability, have never heard of the\\n_Spectator_.\\n\\nFortunately for English letters, other influences prevailed to give a\\ndifferent direction to his fortunes. It is true that Tickell, Addison\\'s\\nearliest biographer, states that his determination not to take orders was\\nthe result of his own habitual self-distrust, and of a fear of the\\nresponsibilities which the clerical office would involve. But Steele, who\\nwas better acquainted with his friend\\'s private history, on reading\\nTickell\\'s Memoir, addressed a letter to Congreve on the subject, in which\\nhe says:\\n\\n    \"These, you know very well, were not the reasons which made Mr.\\n    Addison turn his thoughts to the civil world; and, as you were the\\n    instrument of his becoming acquainted with Lord Halifax, I doubt not\\n    but you remember the warm instances that noble lord made to the head\\n    of the College not to insist upon Mr. Addison\\'s going into orders. His\\n    arguments were founded upon the general pravity and corruption of men\\n    of business, who wanted liberal education. And I remember, as if I had\\n    read the letter yesterday, that my lord ended with a compliment that,\\n    however he might be represented as a friend to the Church, he never\\n    would do it any other injury than keeping Mr. Addison out of it.\"\\n\\nNo doubt the real motive of the interest in Addison shown by Lord Halifax,\\nat that time known as Charles Montague, was an anxiety which he shared\\nwith all the leading statesmen of the period, and of which more will be\\nsaid presently, to secure for his party the services of the ablest\\nwriters. Finding his _protégé_ as yet hardly qualified to transact affairs\\nof State, he joined with Lord Somers, who had also fixed his eyes on\\nAddison, in soliciting for him from the Crown, in 1699, a pension of £300\\na year, which might enable him to supplement his literary accomplishments\\nwith the practical experience of travel. Addison naturally embraced the\\noffer. He looked forward to studying the political institutions of foreign\\ncountries, to seeing the spots of which he had read in his favourite\\nclassical authors, and to meeting the most famous men of letters on the\\nContinent.\\n\\nIt is characteristic both of his own tastes and of his age that he seems\\nto have thought his best passport to intellectual society abroad would be\\nhis Latin poems. His verses on the _Peace of Ryswick_, written in 1697\\nand dedicated to Montague, had already procured him great reputation, and\\nhad been praised by Edmund Smith--a high authority--as \"the best Latin\\npoem since the _Æneid_.\" This gave him the opportunity of collecting his\\nvarious compositions of the same kind, and in 1699 he published from the\\nSheldonian Press a second volume of the _Musæ Anglicanæ_--the first having\\nappeared in 1691--containing poems by various Oxford scholars. Among the\\ncontributors were Hannes, one of the many scholarly physicians of the\\nperiod; J. Philips, the author of the _Splendid Shilling_; and Alsop, a\\nprominent antagonist of Bentley, whose Horatian humour is celebrated by\\nPope in the _Dunciad_.[9]\\n\\nBut the most interesting of the names in the volume is that of the once\\ncelebrated Edmond, commonly called \"Rag,\" Smith, author of the _Ode on the\\nDeath of Dr. Pocock_, who seems to have been among Addison\\'s intimate\\nacquaintance, and deserves to be recollected in connection with him on\\naccount of a certain similarity in their genius and the extraordinary\\ndifference in their fortunes. \"Rag\" was a man of fine accomplishments and\\ngraceful humour, but, like other scholars of the same class, indolent and\\nlicentious. In spite of great indulgence extended to him by the\\nauthorities of Christ Church, he was expelled from the University in\\nconsequence of his irregularities. His friends stood by him, and, through\\nthe interest of Addison, a proposal was made to him to undertake a history\\nof the Revolution, which, however, from political scruples he felt himself\\nobliged to decline. Like Addison, he wrote a tragedy modelled on classical\\nlines; but, as it had no political significance, it only pleased the\\ncritics, without, like \"Cato,\" interesting the public. Like Addison, too,\\nhe had an opportunity of profiting by the patronage of Halifax, but\\nlaziness or whim prevented him from keeping an appointment which the\\nlatter had made with him, and caused him to miss a place worth £300 a\\nyear. Addison, by his own exertions, rose to posts of honour and profit,\\nand towards the close of his life became Secretary of State. Smith envied\\nhis advancement, and, ignoring the fact that his own failure was entirely\\ndue to himself, murmured at fortune for leaving him in poverty. Yet he\\nestimated his wants at £600 a year, and died of indulgence when he can\\nscarcely have been more than forty years of age.\\n\\nAddison\\'s compositions in the _Musæ Anglicanæ_ are eight in number. All of\\nthem are distinguished by the ease and flow of the versification, but they\\nare generally wanting in originality. The best of them is the\\n_Pygmæo-Gerano-Machia_, which is also interesting as showing traces of\\nthat rich vein of humour which Addison worked out in the _Tatler_ and\\n_Spectator_. The mock-heroic style in prose and verse was sedulously\\ncultivated in England throughout the eighteenth century. Swift, Pope,\\nArbuthnot, and Fielding, developed it in various forms; but Addison\\'s\\nLatin poem is perhaps the first composition in which the fine fancy and\\ninvention afterwards shown in the _Rape of the Lock_ and _Gulliver\\'s\\nTravels_ conspicuously displayed itself.\\n\\nA literary success of this kind at that epoch gave a writer a wider\\nreputation than he could gain by compositions in his own language. Armed,\\ntherefore, with copies of the _Musæ Anglicanæ_ for presentation to\\nscholars, and with Halifax\\'s recommendatory letters to men of political\\ndistinction, Addison started for the Continent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nADDISON ON HIS TRAVELS.\\n\\n\\nTravelling in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries involved an amount\\nof thought and precaution which would have seemed inconvenient to the\\ntourist accustomed to abandon himself to the authority of guide-books,\\ncouriers, and railway companies. By ardent spirits like Roderick Random it\\nwas regarded as the sphere of enterprise and fortune, and not without\\nreason, in days when adventures were to be met with on almost every road\\nin the country, and in the streets and inns of the towns. The graver\\nportion of society, on the other hand, considered it as part of the\\nregular course of education through which every young man of position\\nought to pass before entering into active life. French was the universally\\nrecognised language of diplomacy. French manners and conversation were\\nconsidered to be the best school for politeness, while Italy was held in\\nthe highest respect by the northern nations as the source of revived art\\nand letters. Some of the most distinguished Englishmen of the time looked,\\nit is true, with little favour on this fashionable training. \"Lord\\nCowper,\" says Spence, on the information of Dr. Conybeare, \"on his\\ndeath-bed ordered that his son should never travel (it is by the absolute\\ndesire of the Queen that he does). He ordered this from a good deal of\\nobservation on its effects; he had found that there was little to be\\nhoped, and much to be feared, from travelling. Atwell, who is the young\\nlord\\'s tutor abroad, gives but a very discouraging account of it, too, in\\nhis letters, and seems to think that people are sent out too young, and\\nare too hasty to find any great good from it.\"\\n\\nOn some of the stronger and more enthusiastic minds the chief effect of\\nthe grand tour was to produce a violent hatred of all foreign manners.\\nDennis, the critic, for instance, who, after leaving Cambridge, spent some\\ntime on the Continent, returned with a confirmed dislike to the French,\\nand ostentatiously displayed in his writings how much he held \"dragoons\\nand wooden shoes in scorn;\" and it is amusing to find Addison at a later\\ndate making his Tory fox-hunter declare this anti-Gallican temper to be\\nthe main fruits of foreign travel.\\n\\nBut, in general, what was intended to be a school for manners and\\npolitical instruction proved rather a source of unsettlement and\\ndissipation; and the vigorous and glowing lines in which Pope makes the\\ntutor describe to Dullness the doings of the \"young Æneas\" abroad, may be\\ntaken as a faithful picture of the travelled pupil of the period:\\n\\n  \"Intrepid then o\\'er seas and land he flew;\\n  Europe he saw, and Europe saw him too.\\n  There all thy gifts and graces we display,\\n  Thou, only thou, directing all our way!\\n  To where the Seine, obsequious as she runs,\\n  Pours at great Bourbon\\'s feet her silken sons;\\n  Or Tyber, now no longer Roman, rolls,\\n  Vain of Italian arts, Italian souls:\\n  To happy convents bosomed deep in vines,\\n  Where slumber abbots purple as their wines:\\n  To isles of fragrance, lily-silvered vales,\\n  Diffusing languor in the panting gales:\\n  To lands of singing or of dancing slaves,\\n  Love-whispering woods, and lute-resounding waves.\\n  But chief her shrine where naked Venus keeps,\\n  And Cupids ride the lion of the deeps;\\n  Where, eased of fleets, the Adriatic main\\n  Wafts the smooth eunuch and enamoured swain.\\n  Led by my hand, he sauntered Europe round,\\n  And gathered every vice on Christian ground;\\n  Saw every court, heard every king declare\\n  His royal sense of operas or the fair;\\n  The stews and palace equally explored,\\n  Intrigued with glory, and with spirit whored;\\n  Tried all _hors-d\\'oeuvres_, all liqueurs defined,\\n  Judicious drank, and greatly daring dined;\\n  Dropped the dull lumber of the Latin store,\\n  Spoiled his own language, and acquired no more;\\n  All classic learning lost on classic ground;\\n  And last turned air, the echo of a sound.\"\\n\\nIt is needless to say that Addison\\'s experiences of travel were of a very\\ndifferent kind. He left England in his twenty-eighth year, with a mind\\nwell equipped from a study of the best authors, and with the intention of\\nqualifying himself for political employment at home, after familiarising\\nhimself with the languages and manners of foreign countries. His sojourn\\nabroad extended over four years, and his experience was more than usually\\nvaried and comprehensive. Crossing from Dover to Calais, some time in the\\nsummer of 1699, he spent nearly eighteen months in France making himself\\nmaster of the language. In December, 1700, he embarked at Marseilles for a\\ntour in Italy, and visited in succession the following places: Monaco,\\nGenoa, Pavia, Milan, Brescia, Verona, Padua, Venice, Ferrara, Ravenna,\\nRimini, S. Marino, Pesaro, Fano, Sinigaglia, Ancona, Loreto, Rome (where,\\nas it was his intention to return, he only visited St. Peter\\'s and the\\nPantheon), Naples, Capri, whence he came back to Rome by sea, the various\\ntowns in the neighbourhood of Rome, Siena, Leghorn, Pisa, Lucca, Florence,\\nBologna, Modena, Parma, and Turin. Thus, in the course of this journey,\\nwhich lasted exactly a twelvemonth, he twice crossed the Apennines, and\\nmade acquaintance with all the more important cities in the northern part\\nof the Peninsula. In December, 1701, he passed over Mont Cenis to Geneva,\\nproceeding then by Fribourg, Berne, Soleure, Zurich, St. Gall, Linden,\\nInsbruck, Hall, to Vienna, where he arrived in the autumn of 1702. After\\nmaking a brief stay in the Austrian capital he turned his face homewards,\\nand having visited the Protestant cities of Germany, and made a rather\\nlonger stay in Hamburg than in any other, he reached Holland in the spring\\nof 1703, and remained in that country till his return to England, some\\ntime in the autumn of the same year.\\n\\nDuring his journey he made notes for his _Remarks on Italy_, which he\\npublished immediately on his return home, and he amused himself, while\\ncrossing Mont Cenis, with composing his _Letter to Lord Halifax_, which\\ncontains, perhaps, the best verses he ever wrote. Though the ground over\\nwhich he passed was well trodden, and though he possessed none of the\\nspecial knowledge which gives value to the observations of travellers like\\nArthur Young, yet his remarks on the people and places he saw are the\\nproduct of an original mind, and his illustrations of his route from the\\nLatin poets are remarkably happy and graceful. It is interesting, also, to\\nobserve how many of the thoughts and suggestions which occurred to him on\\nthe road are afterwards worked up into papers for the _Spectator_.\\n\\nWhen Addison landed in France, in 1699, the power of Louis XIV., so long\\nthe determined enemy of the English Revolution of 1688, had passed its\\nclimax. The Peace of Ryswick, by which the hopes of the Jacobites were\\nfinally demolished, was two years old. The king, disappointed in his\\ndreams of boundless military glory, had fallen into a fit of devotion, and\\nAddison, arriving from England with a very imperfect knowledge of the\\nlanguage, was astonished to find the whole of French literature saturated\\nwith the royal taste. \"As for the state of learning,\" says he, in a letter\\nto Montague, dated August, 1699, \"there is no book comes out at present\\nthat has not something in it of an air of devotion. Dacier has bin forced\\nto prove his Plato a very good Christian before he ventures upon his\\ntranslation, and has so far comply\\'d with y{e} tast of the age that his\\nwhole book is overrun with texts of Scripture, and y{e} notion of\\npræ-existence, supposed to be stolen from two verses of y{e} prophets.\\nNay, y{e} humour is grown so universal that it is got among y{e} poets,\\nwho are every day publishing Lives of Saints and Legends in Rhime.\"\\n\\nFinding, perhaps, that the conversation at the capital was not very\\ncongenial to his taste, he seems to have hurried on to Blois, a town then\\nnoted for the purity with which its inhabitants spoke the French language,\\nand where he had determined to make his temporary abode. His only record\\nof his first impressions of Paris is a casual criticism of \"y{e} King\\'s\\nStatue that is lately set up in the Place Vendome.\" He visited, however,\\nboth Versailles and Fontainebleau, and the preference which he gives to\\nthe latter (in a letter to Congreve) is interesting, as anticipating that\\ntaste for natural as opposed to artificial beauty which he afterwards\\nexpressed in the _Spectator_.\\n\\n    \"I don\\'t believe, as good a poet as you are, that you can make finer\\n    Lanskips than those about the King\\'s houses, or with all yo{r}\\n    descriptions build a more magnificent palace than Versailles. I am,\\n    however, so singular as to prefer Fontainebleau to the rest. It is\\n    situated among rocks and woods that give you a fine variety of Savage\\n    prospects. The King has Humoured the Genius of the place, and only\\n    made of so much art as is necessary to Help and regulate Nature,\\n    without reforming her too much. The Cascades seem to break through the\\n    Clefts and Cracks of Rocks that are covered over with Moss, and look\\n    as if they were piled upon one another by Accident. There is an\\n    artificial wildness in the Meadows, Walks, and Canals, and y{e}\\n    Garden, instead of a Wall, is Fenced on the Lower End by a Natural\\n    Mound of Rock-work that strikes the eye very agreeably. For my part, I\\n    think there is something more charming in these rude heaps of Stone\\n    than in so many Statues, and wou\\'d as soon see a River winding through\\n    Woods and Meadows as when it is tossed up in such a variety of figures\\n    at Versailles.\"[10]\\n\\nHere and there, too, his correspondence exhibits traces of that delicate\\nvein of ridicule in which he is without a rival, as in the following\\ninimitable description of Le Brun\\'s paintings at Versailles:\\n\\n    \"The painter has represented his most Xtian Majesty under y{e} figure\\n    of Jupiter throwing thunderbolts all about the ceiling, and striking\\n    terror into y{e} Danube and Rhine, that lie astonished and blasted a\\n    little above the Cornice.\"\\n\\nOf his life at Blois a very slight sketch has been preserved by the Abbe\\nPhilippeaux, one of the many gossipping informants from whom Spence\\ncollected his anecdotes:\\n\\n    \"Mr. Addison stayed above a year at Blois. He would rise as early as\\n    between two and three in summer, and lie abed till between eleven and\\n    twelve in the depth of winter. He was untalkative while here, and\\n    often thoughtful; sometimes so lost in thought that I have come into\\n    his room and have stayed five minutes there before he has known\\n    anything of it. He had his masters generally at supper with him, kept\\n    very little company beside, and had no amour whilst here that I know\\n    of, and I think I should have known it if he had had any.\"\\n\\nThe following characteristic letter to a gentleman of Blois, with whom he\\nseems to have had an altercation, is interesting as showing the mixture of\\ncoolness and dignity, the \"blood and judgment well commingled\" which\\nHamlet praised in Horatio, and which are conspicuous in all Addison\\'s\\nactions as well as in his writings:\\n\\n    \"Sir,--I am always as slow in making an Enemy as a Friend, and am\\n    therefore very ready to come to an Accommodation with you; but as for\\n    any satisfaction, I don\\'t think it is due on either side when y{e}\\n    Affront is mutual. You know very well that according to y{e} opinion\\n    of y{e} world a man would as soon be called a Knave as a Fool, and I\\n    believe most people w{d} be rather thought to want Legs than Brains.\\n    But I suppose whatever we said in y{e} heat of discourse is not y{e}\\n    real opinion we have of each other, since otherwise you would have\\n    scorned to subscribe yourself as I do at present, S{r}, y{r} very,\\n    etc.\\n\\n      A. Mons{r} L\\'Espagnol,\\n        Blois, 10{br} 1699.\"\\n\\nThe length of Addison\\'s sojourn at Blois seems to have been partly caused\\nby the difficulty he experienced, owing to the defectiveness of his\\nmemory, in mastering the language. Finding himself at last able to\\nconverse easily, he returned to Paris some time in the autumn of 1700, in\\norder to see a little of polite society there before starting on his\\ntravels in Italy. He found the best company in the capital among the men\\nof letters, and he makes especial mention of Malebranche, whom he\\ndescribes as solicitous about the adequate rendering of his works into\\nEnglish; and of Boileau, who, having now survived almost all his literary\\nfriends, seems, in his conversation with Addison, to have been even more\\nthan usually splenetic in his judgments on his contemporaries. The old\\npoet and critic was, however, propitiated with the present of the _Musæ\\nAnglicanæ_; and, according to Tickell, said \"that he did not question\\nthere were excellent compositions in the native language of a country that\\npossessed the Roman genius in so eminent a degree.\"\\n\\nIn general, Addison\\'s remarks on the French character are not\\ncomplimentary. He found the vanity of the people so elated by the\\nelevation of the Duke of Anjou to the throne of Spain that they were\\ninsupportable, and he felt no reluctance to quit France for Italy. His\\nobservations on the national manners, as seen at Blois, are\\ncharacteristic:\\n\\n    \"Truly, by what I have yet seen, they are the Happiest nation in the\\n    world. \\'Tis not in the pow\\'r of Want or Slavery to make \\'em miserable.\\n    There is nothing to be met with in the Country but Mirth and Poverty.\\n    Ev\\'ry one sings, laughs, and starves. Their Conversation is generally\\n    Agreeable; for if they have any Wit or Sense they are sure to show it.\\n    They never mend upon a Second meeting, but use all the freedom and\\n    familiarity at first Sight that a long Intimacy or Abundance of wine\\n    can scarce draw from an Englishman. Their Women are perfect Mistresses\\n    in this Art of showing themselves to the best Advantage. They are\\n    always gay and sprightly, and set off y{e} worst faces in Europe with\\n    y{e} best airs. Ev\\'ry one knows how to give herself as charming a look\\n    and posture as S{r} Godfrey Kneller c{d} draw her in.\"[11]\\n\\nHe embarked from Marseilles for Genoa in December, 1700, having as his\\ncompanion Edward Wortley Montague, whom Pope satirises under the various\\nnames of Shylock, Worldly, and Avidien. It is unnecessary to follow him\\nstep by step in his travels, but the reader of his _Letter to Lord\\nHalifax_ may still enjoy the delight and enthusiasm to which he gives\\nutterance on finding himself among the scenes described in his favourite\\nauthors:\\n\\n  \"Poetic fields encompass me around,\\n  And still I seem to tread on classic ground;\\n  For here the Muse so oft her harp has strung,\\n  That not a mountain rears its head unsung;\\n  Renowned in verse each shady thicket grows,\\n  And every stream in heavenly numbers flows.\"[12]\\n\\nThe phrase \"classic ground,\" which has become proverbial, is first used in\\nthese verses, and, as will have been observed, Pope repeats it with\\nevident reference to the above passage in his satire on the travels of the\\n\"young Æneas.\" Addison seems to have carried the Latin poets with him, and\\nhis quotations from them are abundant and apposite. When he is driven into\\nthe harbour at Monaco, he remembers Lucan\\'s description of its safety and\\nshelter; as he passes under Monte Circeo, he feels that Virgil\\'s\\ndescription of Æneas\\'s voyage by the same spot can never be sufficiently\\nadmired; he recalls, as he crosses the Apennines, the fine lines of\\nClaudian recording the march of Honorius from Ravenna to Rome; and he\\ndelights to think that at the falls of the Velino he can still see the\\n\"angry goddess\" of the _Æneid_ (Alecto) \"thus sinking, as it were, in a\\ntempest, and plunging herself into Hell\" amidst such a scene of horror and\\nconfusion.\\n\\nHis enthusiastic appreciation of the classics, which caused him in judging\\nany work of art to look, in the first place, for regularity of design and\\nsimplicity of effect, shows it self characteristically in his remarks on\\nthe Lombard and German styles of architecture in Italy. Of Milan Cathedral\\nhe speaks without much admiration, but he was impressed with the wonders\\nof the Certosa near Pavia. \"I saw,\" says he, \"between Pavia and Milan the\\nconvent of the Carthusians, which is very spacious and beautiful. Their\\nchurch is very fine and curiously adorned, _but_ of a Gothic structure.\"\\nHis most interesting criticism, however, is that on the Duomo at Siena:\\n\\n    \"When a man sees the prodigious pains and expense that our forefathers\\n    have been at in these barbarous buildings, one cannot but fancy to\\n    himself what miracles of architecture they would have left us had they\\n    only been instructed in the right way; for, when the devotion of those\\n    ages was much warmer than that of the present, and the riches of the\\n    people much more at the disposal of the priests, there was so much\\n    money consumed on these Gothic cathedrals as would have finished a\\n    greater variety of noble buildings than have been raised either before\\n    or since that time. One would wonder to see the vast labour that has\\n    been laid out on this single cathedral. The very spouts are loaden\\n    with ornaments, the windows are formed like so many scenes of\\n    perspective, with a multitude of little pillars retiring behind one\\n    another, the great columns are finely engraven with fruits and\\n    foliage, that run twisting about them from the very top to the bottom;\\n    the whole body of the church is chequered with different lays of black\\n    and white marble, the pavement curiously cut out in designs and\\n    Scripture stories, and the front covered with such a variety of\\n    figures, and overrun with so many mazes and little labyrinths of\\n    sculpture, that nothing in the world can make a prettier show to those\\n    who prefer false beauties and _affected ornaments_ to a noble and\\n    majestic simplicity.\"[13]\\n\\nAddison had not reached that large liberality in criticism afterwards\\nattained by Sir Joshua Reynolds, who, while insisting that in all art\\nthere was but _one_ true style, nevertheless allowed very high merit to\\nwhat he called the _characteristic_ styles. Sir Joshua would never have\\nfallen into the error of imputing affectation to such simple and honest\\nworkmen as the early architects of Northern Italy. The effects of\\nAddison\\'s classical training are also very visible in his descriptions of\\nnatural scenery. There is in these nothing of that craving melancholy\\nproduced by a sense of the infinity of nature which came into vogue after\\nthe French Revolution; no projection of the feelings of the spectator into\\nthe external scene on which he gazes; nor, on the other hand, is there any\\nattempt to rival the art of the painter by presenting a landscape in words\\ninstead of in colours. He looks on nature with the same clear sight as the\\nGreek and Roman writers, and in describing a scene he selects those\\nparticulars in it which he thinks best adapted to arouse pleasurable\\nimages in the mind of the reader. Take, for instance, the following\\nexcellent description of his passage over the Apennines:\\n\\n    \"The fatigue of our crossing the Apennines, and of our whole journey\\n    from Loretto to Rome, was very agreeably relieved by the variety of\\n    scenes we passed through. For, not to mention the rude prospect of\\n    rocks rising one above another, of the deep gutters worn in the sides\\n    of them by torrents of rain and snow-water, or the long channels of\\n    sand winding about their bottoms that are sometimes filled with so\\n    many rivers, we saw in six days\\' travelling the several seasons of the\\n    year in their beauty and perfection. We were sometimes shivering on\\n    the top of a bleak mountain, and a little while afterwards basking in\\n    a warm valley, covered with violets and almond-trees in blossom, the\\n    bees already swarming over them, though but in the month of February.\\n    Sometimes our road led us through groves of olives, or by gardens of\\n    oranges, or into several hollow apartments among the rocks and\\n    mountains, that look like so many natural greenhouses, as being always\\n    shaded with a great variety of trees and shrubs that never lose their\\n    verdure.\"[14]\\n\\nThough his thoughts during his travels were largely occupied with objects\\nchiefly interesting to his taste and imagination, and though he busied\\nhimself with such compositions as the _Epistle from Italy_, the _Dialogue\\non Medals_, and the first four acts of _Cato_, he did not forget that his\\nexperience was intended to qualify him for taking part in the affairs of\\nState. And when he reached Geneva, in December, 1701, the door to a\\npolitical career seemed to be on the point of opening. He there learned,\\nas Tickell informs us, that he had been selected to attend the army under\\nPrince Eugene as secretary from the King. He accordingly waited in the\\ncity for official confirmation of this intelligence; but his hopes were\\ndoomed to disappointment. William III. died in March, 1702; Halifax, on\\nwhom Addison\\'s prospects chiefly depended, was struck off the Privy\\nCouncil by Queen Anne; and the travelling pension ceased with the life of\\nthe sovereign who had granted it. Henceforth he had to trust to his own\\nresources; and though the loss of his pension does not seem to have\\ncompelled him at once to turn homewards, as he continued on his route to\\nVienna, yet an incident that occurred towards the close of his travels\\nshows that he was prepared to eke out his income by undertaking work that\\nwould have been naturally irksome to him.\\n\\nAt Rotterdam, on his return towards England, he met with Jacob Tonson, the\\nbookseller, for whom, as has been said, he had already done some work as a\\ntranslator. Tonson was one of the founders of the Kit-Kat Club, and in\\nthat capacity was brought into frequent and intimate connection with the\\nWhig magnates of the day. Among these was the Duke of Somerset, who,\\nthrough his wife, then high in Queen Anne\\'s favour, exercised considerable\\ninfluence on the course of affairs. The Duke required a tutor for his\\nson, Lord Hertford, and Tonson recommended Addison. On the Duke\\'s approval\\nof the recommendation, the bookseller seems to have communicated with\\nAddison, who expressed himself, in general terms, as willing to undertake\\nthe charge of Lord Hertford, but desired to know more particulars about\\nhis engagement. These were furnished by the Duke in a letter to Tonson,\\nand they are certainly a very curious illustration of the manners of the\\nperiod. \"I ought,\" says his Grace, \"to enter into that affair more freely\\nand more plainly, and tell you what I propose, and what I hope he will\\ncomply with--viz., I desire he may be more on the account of a companion\\nin my son\\'s travels than as a governor, and that as such I shall account\\nhim: my meaning is, that neither lodging, travelling, nor diet shall cost\\nhim sixpence, and over and above that my son shall present him at the\\nyear\\'s end with a hundred guineas, as long as he is pleased to continue in\\nthat service to my son, by his personal attendance and advice, in what he\\nfinds necessary during his time of travelling.\"\\n\\nTo this not very tempting proposal Addison replied: \"I have lately\\nreceived one or two advantageous offers of y{e} same nature, but as I\\nshould be very ambitious of executing any of your Grace\\'s commands, so I\\ncan\\'t think of taking y{e} like employ from any other hands. As for y{e}\\nrecompense that is proposed to me, I must take the liberty to assure your\\nGrace that I should not see my account in it, but in y{e} hope that I have\\nto recommend myself to your Grace\\'s favour and approbation.\" This reply\\nproved highly offensive to the Duke, who seems to have considered his own\\noffer a magnificent one. \"Your letter of the 16th,\" he writes to Tonson,\\non June 22, 1703, \"with one from Mr. Addison, came safe to me. You say he\\nwill give me an account of his readiness of complying with my proposal. I\\nwill set down his own words, which are thus: \\'As for the recompense that\\nis proposed to me, I must confess I can by no means see my account in it,\\'\\netc. All the other parts of his letter are compliments to me, which he\\nthought he was bound in good breeding to write, and as such I have taken\\nthem, and no otherwise; and now I leave you to judge how ready he is to\\ncomply with my proposal. Therefore, I have wrote by this first post to\\nprevent his coming to England on my account, and have told him plainly\\nthat I must look for another, which I cannot be long a-finding.\"\\n\\nAddison\\'s principal biographer, Miss Aikin, expresses great contempt for\\nthe niggardliness of the Duke, and says that, \"Addison must often have\\ncongratulated himself in the sequel on that exertion of proper spirit by\\nwhich he had escaped from wasting, in an attendance little better than\\nservile, three precious years, which he found means of employing so much\\nmore to his own honour and satisfaction, and to the advantage of the\\npublic.\" Mean as the Duke\\'s offer was, it is nevertheless plain that\\nAddison really intended to accept it, and, this being so, he can scarcely\\nbe congratulated on having on this occasion displayed his usual tact and\\nfelicity. Two courses appear to have been open to him. He might either\\nhave simply declined the offer \"as not finding his account in it,\" or he\\nmight have accepted it in view of the future advantages which he hoped to\\nderive from the Duke\\'s \"favour and approbation;\" in which case he should\\nhave said nothing about finding the \"recompense\" proposed insufficient. By\\nthe course that he took he contrived to miss an appointment which he seems\\nto have made up his mind to accept, and he offended an influential\\nstatesman whose favour he was anxious to secure.\\n\\nTo his pecuniary embarrassments was soon added domestic loss. At Amsterdam\\nhe received news of his father\\'s death, and it may be supposed that the\\nprivate business in which he must have been involved in consequence of\\nthis event brought him to England, where he arrived some time in the\\nautumn of 1703.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nHIS EMPLOYMENT IN AFFAIRS OF STATE.\\n\\n\\nAddison\\'s fortunes were now at their lowest ebb. The party from which he\\nhad looked for preferment was out of office; his chief political patron\\nwas in particular discredit at Court; his means were so reduced that he\\nwas forced to adopt a style of living not much more splendid than that of\\nthe poorest inhabitants of Grub Street. Yet within three years of his\\nreturn to England he was promoted to be an Under-Secretary of State--a\\npost from which he mounted to one position of honour after another till\\nhis final retirement from political life. That he was able to take\\nadvantage of the opportunity that offered itself was owing to his own\\ngenius and capacity; the opportunity was the fruit of circumstances which\\nhad produced an entire revolution in the position of English men of\\nletters.\\n\\nThrough the greater part of Charles II.\\'s reign the profession of\\nliterature was miserably degraded. It is true that the King himself, a man\\nof wit and taste, was not slow in his appreciation of art; but he was by\\nhis character insensible to what was serious or elevated, and the poetry\\nof gallantry, which he preferred, was quite within reach of the courtiers\\nby whom he was surrounded. Rochester, Buckingham, Sedley, and Dorset are\\namong the principal poetical names of the period; all of them being well\\nqualified to shine in verse, the chief requirements of which were a\\ncertain grace of manner, an air of fashionable breeding, and a complete\\ndisregard of the laws of decency. Besides these \"songs by persons of\\nquality,\" the principal entertainment was provided by the drama. But the\\nstage, seldom a lucrative profession, was then crowded with writers whose\\nfertile, if not very lofty, invention kept down the price of plays. Otway,\\nthe most successful dramatist of his time, died in a state of indigence,\\nand as some say, almost of starvation, while playwrights of less ability,\\nif the house was ill-attended on the third night, when the poet received\\nall the profits of the performance, were forced, as Oldham says, \"to\\nstarve or live in tatters all the year.\"[15]\\n\\nPeriodical literature, in the shape of journals and magazines, had as yet\\nno existence; nor could the satirical poet or the pamphleteer find his\\nremuneration in controversial writing the strong reaction against\\nPuritanism having raised the monarchy to a position in which it was\\npractically secure against the assaults of all its enemies. The author of\\nthe most brilliant satire of the period, who had used all the powers of a\\nrich imagination to discredit the Puritan and Republican cause, was paid\\nwith nothing more solid than admiration, and died neglected and in want.\\n\\n  \"The wretch, at summing up his misspent days,\\n  Found nothing left but poverty and praise!\\n  Of all his gains by verse he could not save\\n  Enough to purchase flannel and a grave!\\n  Reduced to want he in due time fell sick,\\n  Was fain to die, and be interred on tick;\\n  And well might bless the fever that was sent\\n  To rid him hence, and his worse fate prevent.\"[16]\\n\\nIn the latter part of this reign, however, a new combination of\\ncircumstances produced a great change in the character of English\\nliterature and in the position of its professors. The struggle of Parties\\nrecommenced. Wearied with the intolerable rule of the Saints, the nation\\nhad been at first glad to leave its newly-restored King to his pleasures,\\nbut, as the memories of the Commonwealth became fainter, the people\\nwatched with a growing feeling of disgust the selfishness and extravagance\\nof the Court, while the scandalous sale of Dunkirk and the sight of the\\nDutch fleet on the Thames made them think of the patriotic energies which\\nCromwell had succeeded in arousing. At the same time the thinly-disguised\\ninclination of the King to Popery, and the avowed opinions of his brother,\\nraised a general feeling of alarm for the Protestant liberties of the\\nnation. On the other hand, the Puritans, taught moderation by adversity,\\nexhibited the really religious side of their character, and attracted\\ntowards themselves a considerable portion of the aristocracy, as well as\\nof the commercial and professional classes in the metropolis--a\\ncombination of interests which helped to form the nucleus of the Whig\\nparty. The clergy and the landed proprietors, who had been the chief\\nsufferers from Parliamentary rule, naturally adhered to the Court, and\\nwere nicknamed by their opponents Tories. Violent party conflicts ensued,\\nmarked by such incidents as the Test Act, the Exclusion Bill, the\\nintrigues of Monmouth, the Popish Plot, and the trial and acquittal of\\nShaftesbury on the charge of high treason.\\n\\nFinding his position no longer so easy as at his restoration, Charles\\nnaturally bethought him of calling literature to his assistance. The\\nstage, being completely under his control, seemed the readiest instrument\\nfor his purpose; the order went forth, and an astonishing display of\\nmonarchical fervour in all the chief dramatists of the time--Otway,\\nDryden, Lee, and Crowne--was the result. Shadwell, who was himself\\ninclined to the Whig interest, laments the change:\\n\\n  \"The stage, like old Rump pulpits, is become\\n  The scene of News, a furious Party\\'s drum.\"\\n\\nBut the political influence of the drama and the audience to which it\\nappealed being necessarily limited, the King sought for more powerful\\nliterary artillery, and he found it in the serviceable genius of Dryden,\\nwhose satirical and controversial poems date from this period. The wide\\npopularity of _Absalom and Achitophel_, written against Monmouth and\\nShaftesbury; of _The Medal_, satirising the acquittal of Shaftesbury; of\\n_The Hind and Panther_, composed to advance the Romanising projects of\\nJames II.; points to the vast influence exercised by literature in the\\nparty struggle. Nevertheless, in spite of all that Dryden had done for the\\nRoyal cause, in spite of the fact that he himself had more than once\\nappealed to the poet for assistance, the ingratitude or levity of Charles\\nwas so inveterate that he let the poet\\'s services go almost unrequited.\\nDryden, it is true, held the posts of Laureate and Royal Historiographer,\\nbut his salary was always in arrears, and the letter which he addressed to\\nRochester, First Lord of the Treasury, asking for six months\\' payment of\\nwhat was due to him, tells its own story.\\n\\nJames II. cared nothing for literature, and was probably too dull of\\napprehension to understand the incalculable service that Dryden had\\nrendered to his cause. He showed his appreciation of the Poet-Laureate\\'s\\ngenius by deducting £100 from the salary which his brother had promised\\nhim, and by cutting off from the emoluments of the office the\\ntime-honoured butt of canary!\\n\\nUnder William III. the complexion of affairs again altered. The Court, in\\nthe old sense of the word, ceased to be a paramount influence in\\nliterature. William III. derived his authority from Parliament; he knew\\nthat he must support it mainly by his sword and his statesmanship. A\\nstranger to England, its manners and its language, he showed little\\ndisposition to encourage letters. Pope, indeed, maliciously suggests that\\nhe had the bad taste to admire the poetry of Blackmore, whom he knighted;\\nbut, as a matter of fact, the honour was conferred on the worthy Sir\\nRichard in consequence of his distinction in medicine, and he himself\\nbears witness to William\\'s contempt for poetry.\\n\\n  \"Reverse of Louis he, example rare,\\n  Loved to deserve the praise he could not bear.\\n  He shunned the acclamations of the throng,\\n  And always coldly heard the poet\\'s song.\\n  Hence the great King the Muses did neglect,\\n  And the mere poet met with small respect.\"[17]\\n\\nSuch political verse as we find in this reign generally consists, like\\nHalifax\\'s _Epistle to Lord Dorset_, or Addison\\'s own _Address to King\\nWilliam_, of hyperbolical flattery. Opposition was extinct, for both\\nparties had for the moment united to promote the Revolution, and the only\\ndiscordant notes amid the chorus of adulation proceeded from Jacobite\\nwriters concealed in the garrets and cellars of Grub Street. Such an\\natmosphere was not favorable to the production of literature of an\\nelevated or even of a characteristic order.\\n\\nAddison\\'s return to England coincided most happily with another remarkable\\nturn of the tide. Leaning decidedly to the Tory party, who were now\\nstrongly leavened with the Jacobite element, Anne had not long succeeded\\nto the throne before she seized an opportunity for dismissing the Whig\\nMinistry whom she found in possession of office. The Whigs, equally\\nalarmed at the influence acquired by their rivals, and at the danger which\\nthreatened the Protestant succession, neglected no effort to\\ncounterbalance the loss of their sovereign\\'s favour by strengthening their\\ncredit with the people. Having been trained in a school which had at least\\nqualified them to appreciate the influence of style, the aristocratic\\nleaders of the party were well aware of the advantages they would derive\\nby attracting to themselves the services of the ablest writers of the day.\\nHence they made it their policy to mingle with men of letters on an equal\\nfooting, and to hold out to them an expectation of a share in the\\nadvantages to be reaped from the overthrow of their rivals.\\n\\nThe result of this union of forces was a great increase in the number of\\nliterary-political clubs. In its half-aristocratic, half-democratic\\nconstitution the club was the natural product of enlarged political\\nfreedom, and helped to extend the organisation of polite opinion beyond\\nthe narrow orbit of Court society. Addison himself, in his simple style,\\npoints out the nature of the fundamental principle of Association which he\\nobserved in operation all around him. \"When a set of men find themselves\\nagree in any particular, though never so trivial, they establish\\nthemselves into a kind of fraternity, and meet once or twice a week upon\\nthe account of such a fantastic resemblance.\"[18] Among these societies,\\nin the first years of the eighteenth century, the most celebrated was,\\nperhaps, the Kit-Kat Club. It consisted of thirty-nine of the leading men\\nof the Whig party; and, though many of these were of the highest rank, it\\nis a characteristic fact that the founder of the club should have been the\\nbookseller Jacob Tonson. It was probably through his influence, joined to\\nthat of Halifax, that Addison was elected a member of the society soon\\nafter his return to England. Among its prominent members was the Duke of\\nSomerset, the first meeting between whom and Addison, after the\\ncorrespondence that had passed between them, must have been somewhat\\nembarrassing. The club assembled at one Christopher Catt\\'s, a pastry-cook,\\nwho gave his name both to the society and the mutton-pies which were its\\nordinary entertainment. Each member was compelled to select a lady as his\\ntoast, and the verses which he composed in her honour were engraved on the\\nwine-glasses belonging to the club. Addison chose the Countess of\\nManchester, whose acquaintance he had made in Paris, and complimented her\\nin the following lines:\\n\\n  \"While haughty Gallia\\'s dames, that spread\\n  O\\'er their pale cheeks an artful red,\\n  Beheld this beauteous stranger there,\\n  In native charms divinely fair,\\n  Confusion in their looks they showed,\\n  And with unborrowed blushes glowed.\"\\n\\nCircumstances seemed now to be conspiring in favour of the Whigs. The\\nTories, whose strength lay mainly in the Jacobite element, were jealous of\\nMarlborough\\'s ascendency over the Queen; on the other hand, the Duchess of\\nMarlborough, who was rapidly acquiring the chief place in Anne\\'s\\naffections, intrigued in favour of the opposite faction. In spite, too, of\\nher Tory predilections, the Queen, finding her throne menaced by the\\nambition of Louis XIV., was compelled in self-defence to look for support\\nto the party which had most vigorously identified itself with the\\nprinciples of the Revolution. She bestowed her unreserved confidence on\\nMarlborough, and he, in order to counterbalance the influence of the\\nJacobites, threw himself into the arms of the Whigs. Being named\\nCaptain-General in 1704, he undertook the campaign which he brought to so\\nglorious a conclusion on the 2d of August in that year at the battle of\\nBlenheim.\\n\\nGodolphin, who, in the absence of Marlborough, occupied the chief place in\\nthe Ministry, moved perhaps by patriotic feeling, and no doubt also by a\\nsense of the advantage which his party would derive from this great\\nvictory, was anxious that it should be commemorated in adequate verse. He\\naccordingly applied to Halifax as the person to whom the _sacer vates_\\nrequired for the occasion would probably be known. Halifax has had the\\nmisfortune to have his character transmitted to posterity by two poets who\\nhated him either on public or private grounds. Swift describes him as the\\nwould-be \"Mæcenas of the nation,\" but insinuates that he neglected the\\nwants of the poets whom he patronised:\\n\\n  \"Himself as rich as fifty Jews,\\n  Was easy though they wanted shoes.\"\\n\\nPope also satirises the vanity and meanness of his disposition in the\\nwell-known character of Bufo. Such portraits, though they are justified to\\nsome extent by evidence coming from other quarters, are not to be too\\nstrictly examined as if they bore the stamp of historic truth. It is, at\\nany rate, certain that Halifax always proved himself a warm and zealous\\nfriend to Addison, and when Godolphin applied to him for a poet to\\ncelebrate Blenheim, he answered that, though acquainted with a person who\\npossessed every qualification for the task, he could not ask him to\\nundertake it. Being pressed for his reasons, he replied \"that while too\\nmany fools and blockheads were maintained in their pride and luxury at the\\npublic expense, such men as were really an honour to their age and country\\nwere shamefully suffered to languish in obscurity; that, for his own\\nshare, he would never desire any gentleman of parts and learning to employ\\nhis time in celebrating a Ministry who had neither the justice nor the\\ngenerosity to make it worth his while.\" In answer to this the Lord\\nTreasurer assured Halifax that any person whom he might name as equal to\\nthe required task, should have no cause to repent of having rendered his\\nassistance; whereupon Halifax mentioned Addison, but stipulated that all\\nadvances to the latter must come from Godolphin himself. Accordingly,\\nBoyle, Chancellor of the Exchequer, afterwards Lord Carleton, was\\ndespatched on the embassy, and, if Pope is to be trusted, found Addison\\nlodged up three pair of stairs over a small shop. He opened to him the\\nsubject, and informed him that, in return for the service that was\\nexpected of him, he was instructed to offer him a Commissionership of\\nAppeal in the Excise, as a pledge of more considerable advancement in the\\nfuture. The fruits of this negotiation were _The Campaign_.\\n\\nWarton disposes of the merits of _The Campaign_ with the cavalier\\ncriticism, so often since repeated, that it is merely \"a gazette in\\nrhyme.\" In one sense the judgment is no doubt just. As a poem, _The\\nCampaign_ shows neither loftiness of invention nor enthusiasm of personal\\nfeeling, and it cannot therefore be ranked with such an ode as Horace\\'s\\n_Qualem ministrum_, or with Pope\\'s very fine _Epistle_ to the Earl of\\nOxford after his disgrace. Its methodical narrative style is scarcely\\nmisrepresented by Warton\\'s sarcastic description of it; but it should be\\nremembered that this style was adopted by Addison with deliberate\\nintention. \"Thus,\" says he, in the conclusion of the poem,\\n\\n  \"Thus would I fain Britannia\\'s wars rehearse\\n  In the smooth records of a faithful verse;\\n  That, if such numbers can o\\'er time prevail,\\n  May tell posterity the wondrous tale.\\n  When actions unadorned are faint and weak\\n  Cities and countries must be taught to speak;\\n  Gods may descend in factions from the skies,\\n  And rivers from their oozy beds arise;\\n  Fiction may deck the truth with spurious rays,\\n  And round the hero cast a borrowed blaze.\\n  Marlbro\\'s exploits appear divinely bright,\\n  And proudly shine in their own native light;\\n  Raised in themselves their genuine charms they boast,\\n  And those that paint them truest praise them most.\"\\n\\nThe design here avowed is certainly not poetical, but it is eminently\\nbusiness-like and extremely well adapted to the end in view. What\\nGodolphin wanted was a set of complimentary verses on Marlborough.\\nAddison, with infinite tact, declares that the highest compliment that can\\nbe paid to the hero is to recite his actions in their unadorned grandeur.\\nThis happy turn of flattery shows how far he had advanced in literary\\nskill since he wrote his address _To the King_. He had then excused\\nhimself for the inadequate celebration of William\\'s deeds on the plea\\nthat, great though these might be, they were too near the poet\\'s own time\\nto be seen in proper focus. A thousand years hence, he suggests, some\\nHomer may be inspired by the theme, \"and Boyne be sung when it has ceased\\nto flow.\" This could not have been very consolatory to a mortal craving\\nfor contemporary applause, and the apology offered in _The Campaign_ for\\nthe prosaic treatment of the subject is far more dexterous. Bearing in\\nmind the fact that it was written to order, and that the poet deliberately\\ndeclined to avail himself of the aid of fiction, we must allow that the\\nconstruction of the poem exhibits both art and dignity. The allusion to\\nthe vast slaughter at Blenheim, in the opening paragraph--\\n\\n  \"Rivers of blood I see and hills of slain,\\n  An Iliad rising out of one campaign\"--\\n\\nis not very fortunate; but the lines describing the ambition of Louis XIV.\\nare weighty and dignified, and the couplet indicating, through the single\\nimage of the Danube, the vast extent of the French encroachments, shows\\nhow thoroughly Addison was imbued with the spirit of classical poetry:\\n\\n  \"The rising Danube its long race began,\\n  And half its course through the new conquests ran.\"\\n\\nWith equal felicity he describes the position and intervention of England,\\nseizing at the same time the opportunity for a panegyric on her free\\ninstitutions:\\n\\n  \"Thrice happy Britain, from the kingdoms rent\\n  To sit the guardian of the Continent!\\n  That sees her bravest sons advanced so high\\n  And flourishing so near her prince\\'s eye;\\n  Thy favourites grow not up by fortune\\'s sport,\\n  Or from the crimes and follies of a court:\\n  On the firm basis of desert they rise,\\n  From long-tried faith and friendship\\'s holy ties,\\n  Their sovereign\\'s well-distinguished smiles they share,\\n  Her ornaments in peace, her strength in war;\\n  The nation thanks them with a public voice,\\n  By showers of blessings Heaven approves their choice;\\n  Envy itself is dumb, in wonder lost,\\n  And factions strive who shall applaud them most.\"\\n\\nHe proceeds in a stream of calm and equal verse, enlivened by dexterous\\nallusions and occasional happy turns of expression, to describe the\\nscenery of the Moselle; the march between the Maese and the Danube; the\\nheat to which the army was exposed; the arrival on the Neckar; and the\\ntrack of devastation left by the French armies. The meeting between\\nMarlborough and Eugene inspires him again to raise his style:\\n\\n  \"Great souls by instinct to each other turn,\\n  Demand alliance, and in friendship burn,\\n  A sudden friendship, while with outstretched rays\\n  They meet each other mingling blaze with blaze.\\n  Polished in courts, and hardened in the field,\\n  Renowned for conquest, and in council skilled,\\n  Their courage dwells not in a troubled flood\\n  Of mounting spirits and fermenting blood;\\n  Lodged in the soul, with virtue overruled,\\n  Inflamed by reason, and by reason cooled,\\n  In hours of peace content to be unknown,\\n  And only in the field of battle shown:\\n  To souls like these in mutual friendship joined\\n  Heaven dares entrust the cause of human kind.\"\\n\\nThe celebrated passage describing Marlborough\\'s conduct at Blenheim is\\ncertainly the finest in the poem:\\n\\n  \"\\'Twas then great Marlborough\\'s mighty soul was proved\\n  That in the shock of charging hosts unmoved,\\n  Amidst confusion, horror, and despair,\\n  Examined all the dreadful scenes of war;\\n  In peaceful thought the field of death surveyed,\\n  To fainting squadrons sent the timely aid,\\n  Inspired repulsed battalions to engage,\\n  And taught the doubtful battle where to rage.\\n  So when an angel by divine command\\n  With rising tempests shakes a guilty land,\\n  Such as of late o\\'er pale Britannia past,\\n  Calm and serene he drives the furious blast;\\n  And pleased th\\' Almighty\\'s orders to perform,\\n  Rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm.\"\\n\\nJohnson makes some characteristic criticisms on this simile, which indeed,\\nhe maintains, is not a simile, but \"an exemplification.\" He says:\\n\"Marlborough is so like the angel in the poem that the action of both is\\nalmost the same, and performed by both in the same manner. Marlborough\\n\\'teaches the battle to rage;\\' the angel \\'directs the storm;\\' Marlborough\\nis \\'unmoved in peaceful thought;\\' the angel is \\'calm and serene;\\'\\nMarlborough stands \\'unmoved amid the shock of hosts;\\' the angel rides\\n\\'calm in the whirlwind.\\' The lines on Marlborough are just and noble; but\\nthe simile gives almost the same images a second time.\"\\n\\nThis judgment would be unimpeachable if the force of the simile lay solely\\nin the likeness between Marlborough and the angel, but it is evident that\\nequal stress is to be laid on the resemblance between the battle and the\\nstorm. It was Addison\\'s intention to raise in the mind of the reader the\\nnoblest possible idea of composure and design in the midst of confusion:\\nto do this he selected an angel as the minister of the divine purpose, and\\na storm as the symbol of fury and devastation; and, in order to heighten\\nhis effect, he recalls with true art the violence of the particular\\ntempest which had recently ravaged the country. Johnson has noticed the\\nclose similarity between the persons of Marlborough and the angel; but he\\nhas exaggerated the resemblance between the actions in which they are\\nseverally engaged.\\n\\n_The Campaign_ completely fulfilled the purpose for which it was written.\\nIt strengthened the position of the Whig Ministry, and secured for its\\nauthor the advancement that had been promised him. Early in 1706 Addison,\\non the recommendation of Lord Godolphin, was promoted from the\\nCommissionership of Appeals in Excise to be Under-Secretary of State to\\nSir Charles Hedges. The latter was one of the few Tories who had retained\\ntheir position in the Ministry since the restoration of the Whigs to the\\nfavour of their sovereign, and he, too, shortly vanished from the stage\\nlike his more distinguished friends, making way for the Earl of\\nSunderland, a staunch Whig, and son-in-law to the Duke of Marlborough.\\n\\nAddison\\'s duties as Under-Secretary were probably not particularly\\narduous. In 1705 he was permitted to attend Lord Halifax to the Court of\\nHanover, whither the latter was sent to carry the Act for the\\nNaturalisation of the Electress Sophia. The mission also included\\nVanbrugh, who, as Clarencieux King-at-Arms, was charged to invest the\\nElector with the Order of the Garter; the party thus constituted affording\\na remarkable illustration of the influence exercised by literature over\\nthe politics of the period. Addison must have obtained during this journey\\nconsiderable insight into the nature of England\\'s foreign policy, as,\\nbesides establishing the closest relations with Hanover, Halifax was also\\ninstructed to form an alliance with the United Provinces for securing the\\nsuccession of the House of Brunswick to the English throne.\\n\\nIn the meantime his imagination was not idle. After helping Steele in the\\ncomposition of his _Tender Husband_, which was acted in 1705, he found\\ntime for engaging in a fresh literary enterprise of his own. The\\nprinciples of operatic music, which had long been developed in Italy, had\\nbeen slow in making their way to this country. Their introduction had been\\ndelayed partly by the French prejudices of Charles II., but more, perhaps,\\nby the strong insular tastes of the people, and by the vigorous forms of\\nthe native drama. What the untutored English audience liked best to hear\\nwas a well-marked tune, sung in a fine natural way: the kind of music\\nwhich was in vogue on the stage till the end of the seventeenth century\\nwas simply the regular drama interspersed with airs; _recitative_ was\\nunknown; and there was no attempt to cultivate the voice according to the\\nmethods practised in the Italian schools. But with the increase of wealth\\nand travel more exacting tastes began to prevail; Italian singers appeared\\non the stage and exhibited to the audience capacities of voice of which\\nthey had hitherto had no experience. In 1705 was acted at the Haymarket\\n_Arsinoe_, the first opera constructed in England on avowedly Italian\\nprinciples. The words were still in English, but the dialogue was\\nthroughout in _recitative_. The composer was Thomas Clayton, who, though a\\nman entirely devoid of genius, had travelled in Italy, and was eager to\\nturn to account the experience which he had acquired. In spite of its\\nbadness _Arsinoe_ greatly impressed the public taste; and it was soon\\nfollowed by _Camilla_, a version of an opera by Bononcini, portions of\\nwhich were sung in Italian, and portions in English--an absurdity on which\\nAddison justly comments in a number of the _Spectator_. His remarks on the\\nconsequences of translating the Italian operas are equally humorous and\\njust.\\n\\n    \"As there was no great danger,\" says he, \"of hurting the sense of\\n    these extraordinary pieces, our authors would often make words of\\n    their own which were entirely foreign to the meaning of the passages\\n    they pretended to translate; their chief care being to make the\\n    numbers of the English verse answer to those of the Italian, that both\\n    of them might go to the same tune. Thus the famous song in _Camilla_,\\n\\n        \\'Barbara si t\\'intendo,\\' etc.\\n        \\'Barbarous woman, yes, I know your meaning,\\'\\n\\n    which expresses the resentment of an angry lover, was translated into\\n    that English lamentation,\\n\\n        \\'Frail are a lover\\'s hopes,\\' etc.\\n\\n    And it was pleasant enough to see the most refined persons of the\\n    British nation dying away and languishing to notes that were filled\\n    with the spirit of rage and indignation. It happened also very\\n    frequently where the sense was rightly translated; the necessary\\n    transposition of words, which were drawn out of the phrase of one\\n    tongue into that of another, made the music appear very absurd in one\\n    tongue that was very natural in the other. I remember an Italian verse\\n    that ran thus, word for word:\\n\\n        \\'And turned my rage into pity,\\'\\n\\n    which the English, for rhyme\\'s sake, translated,\\n\\n        \\'And into pity turned my rage.\\'\\n\\n    By this means the soft notes that were adapted to pity in the Italian\\n    fell upon the word \\'rage\\' in the English; and the angry sounds that\\n    were turned to rage in the original were made to express pity in the\\n    translation. It oftentimes happened likewise that the finest notes in\\n    the air fell upon the most insignificant word in the sentence. I have\\n    known the word \\'and\\' pursued through the whole gamut; have been\\n    entertained with many a melodious \\'the;\\' and have heard the most\\n    beautiful graces, quavers, and divisions bestowed upon \\'then,\\' \\'for,\\'\\n    and \\'from,\\' to the eternal honour of our English particles.\"[19]\\n\\nPerceiving these radical defects, Addison seems to have been ambitious of\\nshowing by example how they might be remedied. \"The great success this\\nopera (_Arsinoe_) met with produced,\" says he, \"some attempts of forming\\npieces upon Italian plans, which should give a more natural and reasonable\\nentertainment than what can be met with in the elaborate trifles of that\\nnation. This alarmed the poetasters and fiddlers of the town, who were\\nused to deal in a more ordinary kind of ware, and therefore laid down an\\nestablished rule, which is received as such to this day, \\'That nothing is\\ncapable of being well set to music that is not nonsense.\\'\"[20] The\\nallusion to the failure of the writer\\'s own opera of _Rosamond_ is\\nunmistakable. The piece was performed on the 2d of April, 1706, but was\\ncoldly received, and after two or three representations was withdrawn.\\n\\nThe reasons which the _Spectator_ assigns for the catastrophe betray\\nrather the self-love of the author than the clear perception of the\\ncritic. _Rosamond_ failed because, in the first place, it was very bad as\\na musical composition. Misled by the favour with which _Arsinoe_ was\\nreceived, Addison seems to have regarded Clayton as a great musician, and\\nhe put his poem into the hands of the latter, thinking that his score\\nwould be as superior to that of _Arsinoe_ as his own poetry was to the\\nwords of that opera. Clayton, however, had no genius, and only succeeded\\nin producing what Sir John Hawkins, quoting with approbation the words of\\nanother critic, calls \"a confused chaos of music, the only merit of which\\nis its shortness.\"[21]\\n\\nBut it may be doubted whether in any case the most skilful composer could\\nhave produced music of a high order adapted to the poetry of _Rosamond_.\\nThe play is neither a tragedy, a comedy, nor a melodrama. It seems that\\nEleanor did not really poison Fair Rosamond, but only administered to her\\na sleeping potion, and, as she takes care to explain to the King,\\n\\n  \"The bowl with drowsy juices filled,\\n  From cold Egyptian drugs distilled,\\n  In borrowed death has closed her eyes.\"\\n\\nThis information proves highly satisfactory to the King, not only because\\nhe is gratified to find that Rosamond is not dead, but also because, even\\nbefore discovering her supposed dead body, he had resolved, in consequence\\nof a dream sent to him by his guardian angel, to terminate the relations\\nexisting between them. The Queen and he accordingly arrange, in a\\nbusiness-like manner, that Rosamond shall be quietly removed in her trance\\nto a nunnery; a reconciliation is then effected between the husband and\\nwife, who, as we are led to suppose, live happily ever after.\\n\\nThe main motive of the opera in Addison\\'s mind appears to have been the\\ndesire of complimenting the Marlborough family. It is dedicated to the\\nDuchess; the warlike character of Henry naturally recalls the prowess of\\nthe great modern captain; and the King is consoled by his guardian angel\\nfor the loss of Fair Rosamond with a vision of the future glories of\\nBlenheim:\\n\\n  \"To calm thy grief and lull thy cares,\\n      Look up and see\\n  What, after long revolving years,\\n      Thy bower shall be!\\n  When time its beauties shall deface,\\n  And only with its ruins grace\\n  The future prospect of the place!\\n  Behold the glorious pile ascending,\\n  Columns swelling, arches bending,\\n  Domes in awful pomp arising,\\n  Art in curious strokes surprising,\\n  Foes in figured fights contending,\\n  Behold the glorious pile ascending.\"\\n\\nThis is graceful enough, but it scarcely offers material for music of a\\nserious kind. Nor can the Court have been greatly impressed by the\\ncompliment paid to its morality, as contrasted with that of Charles II.,\\nconveyed as it was by the mouth of Grideline, one of the comic characters\\nin the piece--\\n\\n      \"Since conjugal passion\\n      Is come into fashion,\\n  And marriage so blest on the throne is,\\n      Like a Venus I\\'ll shine,\\n      Be fond and be fine,\\n  And Sir Trusty shall be my Adonis.\"\\n\\nThe ill success of _Rosamond_ confirmed Addison\\'s dislike to the Italian\\nopera, which he displayed both in his grave and humorous papers on the\\nsubject in the _Spectator_. The disquisition upon the various actors of\\nthe lion in _Hydaspes_ is one of his happiest inspirations; but his\\nserious criticisms are, as a rule, only just in so far as they are\\ndirected against the dramatic absurdities of the Italian opera. As to his\\ntechnical qualifications as a critic of music, it will be sufficient to\\ncite the opinion of Dr. Burney: \"To judges of music nothing more need be\\nsaid of Mr. Addison\\'s abilities to decide concerning the comparative\\ndegrees of national excellence in the art, and the merit of particular\\nmasters, than his predilection for the productions of Clayton, and\\ninsensibility to the force and originality of Handel\\'s compositions in\\n_Rinaldo_.\"[22]\\n\\nIn December, 1708, the Earl of Sunderland was displaced to make room for\\nthe Tory Lord Dartmouth, and Addison, as Under-Secretary, following the\\nfortunes of his superior, found himself again without employment.\\nFortunately for him the Earl of Wharton was almost immediately afterwards\\nmade Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and offered him the lucrative post of\\nSecretary. The Earl, who was subsequently created a Marquis, was the\\nfather of the famous Duke satirised in Pope\\'s first _Moral Essay_; he was\\nin every respect the opposite of Addison--a vehement Republican, a\\nsceptic, unprincipled in his morals, venal in his methods of Government.\\nHe was nevertheless a man of the finest talents, and seems to have\\npossessed the power of gaining personal ascendency over his companions by\\na profound knowledge of character. An acquaintance with Addison, doubtless\\ncommencing at the Kit-Kat Club, of which both were members, had convinced\\nhim that the latter had eminent qualifications for the task, which the\\nSecretary\\'s post would involve, of dealing with men of very various\\nconditions. Of the feelings with which Addison on his side regarded the\\nEarl we have no record. \"It is reasonable to suppose,\" says Johnson, \"that\\nhe counteracted, as far as he was able, the malignant and blasting\\ninfluence of the Lieutenant; and that, at least, by his intervention some\\ngood was done and some mischief prevented.\" Not a shadow of an imputation,\\nat any rate, rests upon his own conduct as Secretary. He appears to have\\nacted strictly on that conception of public duty which he defines in one\\nof his papers in the _Spectator_. Speaking of the marks of a corrupt\\nofficial, \"Such an one,\" he declares, \"is the man who, upon any pretence\\nwhatsoever, receives more than what is the stated and unquestioned fee of\\nhis office. Gratifications, tokens of thankfulness, despatch money, and\\nthe like specious terms, are the pretences under which corruption very\\nfrequently shelters itself. An honest man will, however, look on all these\\nmethods as unjustifiable, and will enjoy himself better in a moderate\\nfortune, that is gained with honour and reputation, than in an overgrown\\nestate that is cankered with the acquisitions of rapine and exaction. Were\\nall our offices discharged with such an inflexible integrity, we should\\nnot see men in all ages, who grow up to exorbitant wealth, with the\\nabilities which are to be met with in an ordinary mechanic.\"[23] His\\nfriends perhaps considered that his impartiality was somewhat\\noverstrained, since he always declined to remit the customary fees in\\ntheir favour. \"For,\" said he, \"I may have forty friends, whose fees may be\\ntwo guineas a-piece; then I lose eighty guineas, and my friends gain but\\ntwo a-piece.\"\\n\\nHe took with him as his own Secretary, Eustace Budgell, who was related to\\nhim, and for whom he seems to have felt a warm affection. Budgell was a\\nman of considerable literary ability, and was the writer of the various\\npapers in the _Spectator_ signed \"X,\" some of which succeed happily in\\nimitating Addison\\'s style. While he was under his friend\\'s guidance his\\ncareer was fairly successful, but his temper was violent, and when, at a\\nlater period of his life, he served in Ireland under a new Lieutenant and\\nanother Secretary, he became involved in disputes which led to his\\ndismissal. A furious pamphlet against the Lord-Lieutenant, the Duke of\\nBolton, published by him in spite of Addison\\'s remonstrances, only\\ncomplicated his position, and from this period his fortunes steadily\\ndeclined. He lost largely in the South Sea Scheme; spent considerable sums\\nin a vain endeavour to obtain a seat in Parliament; and at last came under\\nthe influence of his kinsman, Tindal, the well-known deist, whose will he\\nis accused of having falsified. With his usual infelicity he happened to\\nrouse the resentment of Pope, and was treated in consequence to one of\\nthe deadly couplets with which that great poet was in the habit of\\nrepaying real or supposed injuries:\\n\\n  \"Let Budgell charge low Grub Street on his quill,\\n  And write whate\\'er he pleased--except his will.\"\\n\\nThe lines were memorable, and were doubtless often quoted, and the\\nwretched man finding his life insupportable, ended it by drowning himself\\nin the Thames.\\n\\nDuring his residence in Ireland Addison firmly cemented his friendship\\nwith Swift, whose acquaintance he had probably made after _The Campaign_\\nhad given him a leading position in the Whig party, on the side of which\\nthe sympathies of both were then enlisted. Swift\\'s admiration for Addison\\nwas warm and generous. When the latter was on the point of embarking on\\nhis new duties, Swift wrote to a common friend, Colonel Hunter, \"Mr.\\nAddison is hurrying away for Ireland, and I pray too much business may not\\nspoil _le plus honnete homme du monde_.\" To Archbishop King he wrote: \"Mr.\\nAddison, who goes over our first secretary, is a most excellent person,\\nand being my intimate friend I shall use all my credit to set him right in\\nhis notions of persons and things.\" Addison\\'s duties took him occasionally\\nto England, and during one of his visits Swift writes to him from Ireland:\\n\"I am convinced that whatever Government come over you will find all marks\\nof kindness from any parliament here with respect to your employment, the\\nTories contending with the Whigs which should speak best of you. In short,\\nif you will come over again when you are at leisure we will raise an army\\nand make you King of Ireland. Can you think so meanly of a kingdom as not\\nto be pleased that every creature in it, who hath one grain of worth, has\\na veneration for you?\" In his _Journal to Stella_ he says, under date of\\nOctober 12, 1710: \"Mr. Addison\\'s election has passed easy and undisputed;\\nand I believe if he had a mind to be chosen king he would hardly be\\nrefused.\" On his side Addison\\'s feelings were equally warm. He presented\\nSwift with a copy of his _Remarks on Several Parts of Italy_, inscribing\\nit--\"To the most agreeable companion, the truest friend, and the greatest\\ngenius of his age.\"\\n\\nThis friendship, founded on mutual respect, was destined to be impaired by\\npolitical differences. In 1710 the credit of the Whig Ministry had been\\ngreatly undermined by the combined craft of Harley and Mrs. Masham, and\\nSwift, who was anxious as to his position, on coming over to England to\\npress his claims on Somers and Halifax, found that they were unable to\\nhelp him. He appears to have considered that their want of power proceeded\\nfrom want of will; at any rate, he made advances to Harley, which were of\\ncourse gladly received. The Ministry were at this time being hard pressed\\nby the _Examiner_, under the conduct of Prior, and at their instance\\nAddison started the _Whig Examiner_ in their defence. Though this paper\\nwas written effectively and with admirable temper, party polemics were\\nlittle to the taste of its author, and, after five numbers, it ceased to\\nexist on the 8th of October. Swift, now eager for the triumph of the\\nTories, expresses his delight to Stella by informing her, in the words of\\na Tory song, that \"it was down among the dead men.\" He himself wrote the\\nfirst of his _Examiners_ on the 2d of the following November, and the\\ncrushing blows with which he followed it up did much to hasten the\\ndownfall of the Ministry. As was natural, Addison was somewhat displeased\\nat his friend\\'s defection. In December Swift writes to Stella, \"Mr.\\nAddison and I are as different as black and white, and I believe our\\nfriendship will go off by this d---- business of party. He cannot bear\\nseeing me fall in so with the Ministry; but I love him still as much as\\never, though we seldom meet.\" In January, 1710-11, he says: \"I called at\\nthe coffee-house, where I had not been in a week, and talked coldly awhile\\nwith Mr. Addison; all our friendship and dearness are off; we are civil\\nacquaintance, talk words, of course, of when we shall meet, and that\\'s\\nall. Is it not odd?\" Many similar entries follow; but on June 26, 1711,\\nthe record is: \"Mr. Addison and I talked as usual, and as if we had seen\\none another yesterday.\" And on September 14, he observes: \"This evening I\\nmet Addison and pastoral Philips in the Park, and supped with them in\\nAddison\\'s lodgings. We were very good company, and I yet know no man half\\nso agreeable to me as he is. I sat with them till twelve.\"\\n\\nIt was perhaps through the influence of Swift, who spoke warmly with the\\nTory Ministry on behalf of Addison, that the latter, on the downfall of\\nthe Whigs in the autumn of 1710, was for some time suffered to retain the\\nKeepership of the Records in Bermingham\\'s Tower, an Irish place which had\\nbeen bestowed upon him by the Queen as a special mark of the esteem with\\nwhich she regarded him, and which appears to have been worth £400 a\\nyear.[24] In other respects his fortunes were greatly altered by the\\nchange of Ministry. \"I have within this twelvemonth,\" he writes to Wortley\\non the 21st of July, 1711, \"lost a place of £2000 per ann., an estate in\\nthe Indies worth £14,000, and, what is worse than all the rest, my\\nmistress.[25] Hear this and wonder at my philosophy! I find they are going\\nto take away my Irish place from me too; to which I must add that I have\\njust resigned my fellowship, and that stocks sink every day.\" In spite of\\nthese losses his circumstances were materially different from those in\\nwhich he found himself after the fall of the previous Whig Ministry in\\n1702. Before the close of the year 1711 he was able to buy the estate of\\nBilton, near Rugby, for £10,000. Part of the purchase money was probably\\nprovided from what he had saved while he was Irish Secretary, and had\\ninvested in the funds; and part was, no doubt, made up from the profits of\\nthe _Tatler_ and the _Spectator_. Miss Aikin says that a portion was\\nadvanced by his brother Gulston; but this seems to be an error. Two years\\nbefore, the Governor of Fort St. George had died, leaving him his executor\\nand residuary legatee. This is no doubt \"the estate in the Indies\" to\\nwhich he refers in his letter to Wortley, but he had as yet derived no\\nbenefit from it. His brother had left his affairs in great confusion; the\\ntrustees were careless or dishonest; and though about £600 was remitted to\\nhim in the shape of diamonds in 1713, the liquidation was not complete\\ntill 1716, when only a small moiety of the sum bequeathed to him came into\\nhis hands.[26]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\nTHE _TATLER_ AND _SPECTATOR_.\\n\\n\\nThe career of Addison, as described in the preceding chapters, has\\nexemplified the great change effected in the position of men of letters in\\nEngland by the Restoration and the Revolution; it is now time to exhibit\\nhim in his most characteristic light, and to show the remarkable service\\nthe eighteenth century essayists performed for English society in creating\\nan organised public opinion. It is difficult for ourselves, who look on\\nthe action of the periodical press as part of the regular machinery of\\nlife, to appreciate the magnitude of the task accomplished by Addison and\\nSteele in the pages of the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_. Every day, week,\\nmonth, and quarter now sees the issue of a vast number of journals and\\nmagazines intended to form the opinion of every order and section of\\nsociety; but in the reign of Queen Anne the only centres of society that\\nexisted were the Court, with the aristocracy that revolved about it, and\\nthe clubs and coffee-houses, in which the commercial and professional\\nclasses met to discuss matters of general interest. The _Tatler_ and\\n_Spectator_ were the first organs in which an attempt was made to give\\nform and consistency to the opinion arising out of this social contact.\\nBut we should form a very erroneous idea of the character of these\\npublications if we regarded them as the sudden productions of individual\\ngenius, written in satisfaction of a mere temporary taste. Like all\\nmasterpieces in art and literature, they mark the final stage of a long\\nand painful journey, and the merit of their inventors consists largely in\\nthe judgment with which they profited by the experience of many\\npredecessors.\\n\\nThe first newspaper published in Europe was the _Gazzetta_ of Venice,\\nwhich was written in manuscript, and read aloud at certain places in the\\ncity, to supply information to the people during the war with the Turks in\\n1536. In England it was not till the reign of Elizabeth that the increased\\nfacilities of communication and the growth of wealth caused the purveyance\\nof news to become a profitable employment. Towards the end of the\\nsixteenth century newsmongers began to issue little pamphlets reporting\\nextraordinary intelligence, but not issued at regular periods. The titles\\nof these publications, which are all of them that survive, show that the\\narts with which the framers of the placards of our own newspapers\\nendeavour to attract attention are of venerable antiquity: \"Wonderful and\\nStrange newes out of Suffolke and Essex, where it rained wheat the space\\nof six or seven miles\" (1583); \"Lamentable newes out of Monmouthshire,\\ncontaininge the wonderfull and fearfull accounts of the great overflowing\\nof the waters in the said countrye\" (1607).[27]\\n\\nIn 1622 one Nathaniel Butter began to publish a newspaper bearing a fixed\\ntitle and appearing at stated intervals. It was called the _Weekly Newes\\nfrom Italy and Germanie, etc._, and was said to be printed for _Mercurius\\nBritannicus_. This novelty provided much food for merriment to the poets,\\nand Ben Jonson in his _Staple of News_ satirises Butter, under the name\\nof Nathaniel, in a passage which the curious reader will do well to\\nconsult, as it shows the low estimation in which newspapers were then\\nheld.[28]\\n\\nThough it might appear from Jonson\\'s dialogue that the newspapers of that\\nday contained many items of domestic intelligence, such was scarcely the\\ncase. Butter and his contemporaries, as was natural to men who confined\\nthemselves to the publication of news without attempting to form opinion,\\nobtained their materials almost entirely from abroad, whereby they at once\\naroused more vividly the imagination of their readers, and doubtless gave\\nmore scope to their own invention. Besides, they were not at liberty to\\nretail home news of that political kind which would have been of the\\ngreatest interest to the public. For a long time the evanescent character\\nof the newspaper allowed it to escape the attention of the licenser, but\\nthe growing demand for this sort of reading at last brought it under\\nsupervision, and so strict was the control exercised over even the reports\\nof foreign intelligence that its weekly appearance was frequently\\ninterrupted.\\n\\nIn 1641, however, the Star-chamber was abolished, and the heated political\\natmosphere of the times generated a new species of journal, in which we\\nfind the first attempt to influence opinion through the periodical press.\\nThis was the newspaper known under the generic title of _Mercury_. Many\\nweekly publications of this name appeared during the Civil Wars on the\\nside of both King and Parliament, _Mercurius Anlicus_ being the\\nrepresentative organ of the Royalist cause, and _Mercurius Pragmaticus_\\nand _Mercurius Politicus_ of the Republicans. Party animosities were thus\\nkept alive, and proved so inconvenient to the Government that the\\nParliament interfered to curtail the liberty of the press. In 1647 an\\nordinance passed the House of Lords, prohibiting any person from \"making,\\nwriting, printing, selling, publishing, or uttering, or causing to be\\nmade, any book, sheet, or sheets of news whatsoever, except the same be\\nlicensed by both or either House of Parliament, with the name of the\\nauthor, printer, and licenser affixed.\" In spite of this prohibition,\\nwhich was renewed by Act of Parliament in 1662, many unlicensed\\nperiodicals continued to appear, till in 1663 the Government, finding\\ntheir repressive measures insufficient, resolved to grapple with the\\ndifficulty by monopolising the right to publish news.\\n\\nThe author of this new project was the well-known Roger L\\'Estrange, who in\\n1663 obtained a patent assigning to him \"all the sole privilege of\\nwriting, printing, and publishing all Narratives, Advertisements,\\nMercuries, Intelligencers, Diurnals, and other books of public\\nintelligence.\" L\\'Estrange\\'s journal was called the _Public Intelligencer_;\\nit was published once a week, and in its form was a rude anticipation of\\nthe modern newspaper, containing as it did an obituary, reports of the\\nproceedings in Parliament and in the Court of Claims, a list of the\\ncircuits of the judges, of sheriffs, Lent preachers, etc. After being\\ncontinued for two years it gave place first, in 1665, to the _Oxford\\nGazette_, published at Oxford, whither the Court had retired during the\\nplague; and in 1666 to the _London Gazette_, which was under the immediate\\ncontrol of an Under-Secretary of State. The office of Gazetteer became\\nhenceforth a regular ministerial appointment, and was viewed with\\ndifferent eyes according as men were affected towards the Government.\\nSteele, who held it, says of it: \"My next appearance as a writer was in\\nthe quality of the lowest Minister of State--to wit, in the office of\\nGazetteer; where I worked faithfully according to order, without ever\\nerring against the rule observed by all Ministers, to keep that paper very\\ninnocent and very insipid.\" Pope, on the other hand, who regarded it as an\\norgan published to influence opinion in favour of the Government, is\\nconstant in his attacks upon it, and has immortalised it in the memorable\\nlines in the _Dunciad_ beginning, \"Next plunged a feeble but a desperate\\npack,\" etc.\\n\\nIn 1679 the Licensing Act passed in 1662 expired, and the Parliament\\ndeclined to renew it. The Court was thus left without protection against\\nthe expression of public opinion, which was daily becoming more bold and\\noutspoken. In his extremity the King fell back on the servility of the\\njudges, and, having procured from them an opinion that the publishing of\\nany printed matter without license was contrary to the common law, he\\nissued his famous Proclamation (in 1680) \"to prohibit and forbid all\\npersons whatsoever to print or publish any news, book, or pamphlets of\\nnews, not licensed by his Majesty\\'s authority.\"\\n\\nDisregard of the proclamation was treated as a breach of the peace, and\\nmany persons were punished accordingly. This severity produced the effect\\nintended. The voice of the periodical press was stifled, and the _London\\nGazette_ was left almost in exclusive possession of the field of news.\\nWhen Monmouth landed in 1685 the King managed to obtain from Parliament a\\nrenewal of the Licensing Act for seven years, and even after the\\nRevolution of 1688 several attempts were made by the Ministerial Whigs to\\nprolong or to renew the operation of the Act. In spite, however, of the\\nviolence of the organs of \"Grub Street,\" which had grown up under it,\\nthese attempts were unsuccessful; it was justly felt that it was wiser to\\nleave falsehood and scurrility to be gradually corrected by public\\nopinion, as speaking through an unfettered press, than to attack them by a\\nlaw which they had proved themselves able to defy. From 1682 the freedom\\nof the press may therefore be said to date, and the lapse of the Licensing\\nAct was the signal for a remarkable outburst of journalistic enterprise\\nand invention. Not only did the newspapers devoted to the report of\\nforeign intelligence reappear in greatly increased numbers, but, whereas\\nthe old _Mercuries_ had never been published more than once in the same\\nweek, the new comers made their appearance twice and sometimes even three\\ntimes. In 1702 was printed the first daily newspaper, _The Daily Courant_.\\nIt could only at starting provide material to cover one side of a half\\nsheet of paper; but the other side was very soon covered with printed\\nmatter, in which form its existence was prolonged till 1735.\\n\\nThe development of party government of course encouraged the controversial\\ncapacities of the journalist, and many notorious, and some famous names\\nare now found among the combatants in the political arena. On the side of\\nthe Whigs the most redoubtable champions were Daniel Defoe, of the\\n_Review_, who was twice imprisoned and once set in the pillory for his\\npolitical writings; John Tutchin, of the _Observator_; and Ridpath, of the\\n_Flying Post_--all of whom have obtained places in the _Dunciad_. The old\\nTories appear to have been satisfied during the early part of Queen Anne\\'s\\nreign with prosecuting the newspapers that attacked them; but Harley, who\\nunderstood the power of the press, engaged Prior to harass the Whigs in\\nthe _Examiner_, and was afterwards dexterous enough to secure the\\ninvaluable assistance of Swift for the same paper. In opposition to the\\n_Examiner_ in its early days the Whigs, as has been said, started the\\n_Whig Examiner_, under the auspices of Addison, so that the two great\\nhistorical parties had their cases stated by the two greatest\\nprose-writers of the first half of the eighteenth century.\\n\\nBeside the Quidnunc and the party politician, another class of reader now\\nappeared demanding aliment in the press. Men of active and curious minds,\\nwith a little leisure and a large love of discussion, loungers at Will\\'s\\nor at the Grecian Coffee-Houses, were anxious to have their doubts on all\\nsubjects resolved by a printed oracle. Their tastes were gratified by the\\ningenuity of John Dunton, whose strange account of his _Life and Errors_\\nthrows a strong light on the literary history of this period. In 1690\\nDunton published his _Athenian Gazette_, the name of which he afterwards\\naltered to the _Athenian Mercury_. The object of this paper was to answer\\nquestions put to the editor by the public. These were of all kinds--on\\nreligion, casuistry, love, literature, and manners--no question being too\\nsubtle or absurd to extract a reply from the conductor of the paper. The\\n_Athenian Mercury_ seems to have been read by as many distinguished men of\\nthe period as _Notes and Queries_ in our own time, and there can be no\\ndoubt that the quaint humours it originated gave the first hint to the\\ninventors of the _Tatler_ and the _Spectator_.\\n\\nAdvertisements were inserted in the newspapers at a comparatively early\\nperiod of their existence. The editor acted as middleman between the\\nadvertiser and the public, and made his announcements in a style of easy\\nfrankness which will appear to the modern reader extremely refreshing.\\nThus, in the \"Collection for the Improvement of Husbandry and Trade\"\\n(1682), there are the following:\\n\\n    \"If I can meet with a sober man that has a counter-tenor voice, I can\\n    help him to a place worth thirty pound the year or more.\\n\\n    \"If any noble or other gentleman wants a porter that is very lusty,\\n    comely, and six foot high and two inches, I can help.\\n\\n    \"I want a complete young man that will wear a livery, to wait on a\\n    very valuable gentleman; but he must know how to play on a violin or\\n    flute.\\n\\n    \"I want a genteel footman that can play on the violin, to wait on a\\n    person of honour.\"[29]\\n\\nEverything was now prepared for the production of a class of newspaper\\ndesigned to form and direct public opinion on rational principles. The\\npress was emancipated from State control; a reading public had constituted\\nitself out of the _habitués_ of the coffee-houses and clubs; nothing was\\nwanted but an inventive genius to adapt the materials at his disposal to\\nthe circumstances of the time. The required hero was not long in making\\nhis appearance.\\n\\nRichard Steele, the son of an official under the Irish Government, was,\\nabove all things, \"a creature of ebullient heart.\" Impulse and sentiment\\nwere with him always far stronger motives of action than reason,\\nprinciple, or even interest. He left Oxford, without taking a degree, from\\nan ardent desire to serve in the army, thereby sacrificing his prospect of\\nsucceeding to a family estate; his extravagance and dissipation while\\nserving in the cavalry were notorious; yet this did not dull the clearness\\nof his moral perceptions, for it was while his excesses were at their\\nheight that he dedicated to his commanding officer, Lord Cutts, his\\n_Christian Hero_. Vehement in his political, as in all other feelings, he\\ndid not hesitate to resign the office he held under the Tory Government in\\n1711 in order to attack it for what he considered its treachery to the\\ncountry; but he was equally outspoken, and with equal disadvantage to\\nhimself, when he found himself at a later period in disagreement with the\\nWhigs. He had great fertility of invention, strong natural humour, true\\nthough uncultivated taste, and inexhaustible human sympathy.\\n\\nHis varied experience had made him well acquainted with life and\\ncharacter, and in his office of Gazetteer he had had an opportunity of\\nwatching the eccentricities of the public taste, which, now emancipated\\nfrom restraint, began vaguely to feel after new ideals. That, under such\\ncircumstances, he should have formed the design of treating current events\\nfrom a humorous point of view was only natural, but he was indebted for\\nthe form of his newspaper to the most original genius of the age. Swift\\nhad early in the eighteenth century exercised his ironical vein by\\ntreating the everyday occurrences of life in a mock-heroic style. Among\\nhis pieces of this kind that were most successful in catching the public\\ntaste were the humorous predictions of the death of Partridge, the\\nastrologer, signed with the name of Isaac Bickerstaff. Steele, seizing on\\nthe name and character of Partridge\\'s fictitious rival, turned him with\\nmuch pleasantry into the editor of a new journal, the design of which he\\nmakes Isaac describe as follows:\\n\\n    \"The state of conversation and business in this town having long been\\n    perplexed with Pretenders in both kinds, in order to open men\\'s minds\\n    against such abuses, it appeared no unprofitable undertaking to\\n    publish a Paper, which should observe upon the manners of the\\n    pleasurable, as well as the busy part of mankind. To make this\\n    generally read, it seemed the most proper method to form it by way of\\n    a Letter of Intelligence, consisting of such parts as might gratify\\n    the curiosity of persons of all conditions and of each sex.... The\\n    general purposes of this Paper is to expose the false arts of life, to\\n    pull off the disguises of cunning, vanity, and affectation, and to\\n    recommend a general simplicity in our dress, our discourse, and our\\n    behaviour.\"[30]\\n\\nThe name of the _Tatler_, Isaac informs us, was \"invented in honour of the\\nfair sex,\" for whose entertainment the new paper was largely designed. It\\nappeared three times a week, and its price was a penny, though it seems\\nthat the first number, published April 12, 1709, was distributed _gratis_\\nas an advertisement. In order to make the contents of the paper varied it\\nwas divided into five portions, of which the editor gives the following\\naccount:\\n\\n    \"All accounts of Gallantry, Pleasure, and Entertainment, shall be\\n    under the article of White\\'s Chocolate-House; Poetry under that of\\n    Will\\'s Coffee-House; Learning under the title of Grecian; Foreign and\\n    Domestic News you will have from Saint James\\' Coffee-House; and what\\n    else I have to offer on any other subject shall be dated from my own\\n    apartment.\"[31]\\n\\nIn this division we see the importance of the coffee-houses as the natural\\ncentres of intelligence and opinion. Of the four houses mentioned, St.\\nJames\\' and White\\'s, both of them in St. James\\' Street, were the chief\\nhaunts of statesmen and men of fashion, and the latter had acquired an\\ninfamous notoriety for the ruinous gambling of its _habitués_. Will\\'s, in\\nRussell Street, Covent Garden, kept up the reputation which it had\\nprocured in Dryden\\'s time as the favourite meeting-place of men of\\nletters; while the Grecian, in Devereux Court in the Strand, which was the\\noldest coffee-house in London, afforded a convenient _rendezvous_ for the\\nlearned Templars. At starting, the design announced in the first number\\nwas adhered to with tolerable fidelity. The paper dated from St. James\\'\\nCoffee-House was always devoted to the recital of foreign news; that from\\nWill\\'s either criticised the current dramas, or contained a copy of\\nverses from some author of repute, or a piece of general literary\\ncriticism; the latest gossip at White\\'s was reproduced in a fictitious\\nform and with added colour. Advertisements were also inserted; and half a\\nsheet of the paper was left blank, in order that at the last moment the\\nmost recent intelligence might be added in manuscript, after the manner of\\nthe contemporary news-letters. In all these respects the character of the\\nnewspaper was preserved; but in the method of treating news adopted by the\\neditor there was a constant tendency to subordinate matter of fact to the\\nelements of humour, fiction, and sentiment. In his survey of the manners\\nof the time, Isaac, as an astrologer, was assisted by a familiar spirit,\\nnamed Pacolet, who revealed to him the motives and secrets of men; his\\nsister, Mrs. Jenny Distaff, was occasionally deputed to produce the paper\\nfrom the wizard\\'s \"own apartment;\" and Kidney, the waiter at St. James\\'\\nCoffee-House, was humorously represented as the chief authority in all\\nmatters of foreign intelligence.\\n\\nThe mottoes assumed by the _Tatler_ at different periods of its existence\\nmark the stages of its development. On its first appearance, when Steele\\nseems to have intended it to be little more than a lively record of news,\\nthe motto placed at the head of each paper was\\n\\n  \"Quidquid agunt homines,\\n              nostri est farrago libelli.\"\\n\\nIt soon became evident, however, that its true function was not merely to\\nreport the actions of men, but to discuss the propriety of their actions;\\nand by the time that sufficient material had accumulated to constitute a\\nvolume, the essayists felt themselves justified in appropriating the words\\nused by Pliny in the preface to his _Natural History_:\\n\\n    \"Nemo apud nos qui idem tentaverit: equidem sentio peculiarem in\\n    studiis causam corum esse, qui difficultatibus victis, utilitatem\\n    juvandi, protulerunt gratiæ placendi. Res ardua vetustis novitatem\\n    dare, novis auctoritatem, obsoletis nitorem, fastidiis gratiam, dubiis\\n    fidem, omnibus vero naturam, et naturæ suæ omnia. Itaque NON ASSECUTIS\\n    _voluisse_, abunde pulchrum atque magnificum est.\"\\n\\nThe disguise of the mock astrologer proved very useful to Steele in his\\ncharacter of moralist. It enabled him to give free utterance to his better\\nfeelings, without the risk of incurring the charge of inconsistency or\\nhypocrisy, and nothing can be more honourable to him than the open manner\\nin which he acknowledges his own unfitness for the position of a moralist:\\n\"I shall not carry my humility so far,\" says he, \"as to call myself a\\nvicious man, but at the same time must confess my life is at best but\\npardonable. With no greater character than this, a man would make but an\\nindifferent progress in attacking prevailing and fashionable vices, which\\nMr. Bickerstaff has done with a freedom of spirit that would have lost\\nboth its beauty and efficacy had it been pretended to by Mr. Steele.\"[32]\\n\\nAs Steele cannot claim the sole merit of having invented the form of the\\n_Tatler_, so, too, it must be remembered that he could never have\\naddressed society in the high moral tone assumed by Bickerstaff if the\\nroad had not been prepared for him by others. One name among his\\npredecessors stands out with a special title to honourable record. Since\\nthe Restoration the chief school of manners had been the stage, and the\\nflagrant example of immorality set by the Court had been bettered by the\\ninvention of the comic dramatists of the period. Indecency was the\\nfashion; religion and sobriety were identified by the polite world with\\nPuritanism and hypocrisy. Even the Church had not yet ventured to say a\\nword in behalf of virtue against the prevailing taste, and when at last a\\nclergyman raised his voice on behalf of the principles which he professed,\\nthe blow which he dealt to his antagonists was the more damaging because\\nit was entirely unexpected. Jeremy Collier was not only a Tory but a\\nJacobite, not only a High Churchman but a Nonjuror, who had been outlawed\\nfor his fidelity to the principles of Legitimism; and that such a man\\nshould have published the _Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of\\nthe English Stage_, reflecting, as the book did, in the strongest manner\\non the manners of the fallen dynasty, was as astounding as thunder from a\\nclear sky. Collier, however, was a man of sincere piety, whose mind was\\nfor the moment occupied only by the overwhelming danger of the evil which\\nhe proposed to attack. It is true that his method of attack was cumbrous,\\nand that his conclusions were far too sweeping and often unjust;\\nnevertheless, the general truth of his criticisms was felt to be\\nirresistible. Congreve and Vanbrugh each attempted an apology for their\\nprofession; both, however, showed their perception of the weakness of\\ntheir position by correcting or recasting scenes in their comedies to\\nwhich Collier had objected. Dryden accepted the reproof in a nobler\\nspirit. Even while he had pandered to the tastes of the times, he had been\\nconscious of his treachery to the cause of true art, and had broken out in\\na fine passage in his _Ode to the Memory of Mrs. Killigrew_:\\n\\n  \"O gracious God! how far have we\\n  Profaned thy heavenly gift of poesy!\\n  Made prostitute and profligate the Muse,\\n  Debased to each obscene and impious use!\\n\\n     *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n  \"O wretched we! why were we hurried down\\n    This lubrique and adulterous age\\n  (Nay, added fat pollutions of our own)\\n    To increase the streaming ordure of the stage?\"\\n\\nWhen Collier attacked him he bent his head in submission. \"In many\\nthings,\" says he, \"he has taxed me justly, and I have pleaded guilty to\\nall thought and expressions of mine which can be truly argued of\\nobscenity, profaneness, or immorality, and retract them. If he be my\\nenemy, let him triumph; if he be my friend, as I have given him no\\npersonal occasion to be otherwise, he will be glad of my repentance.\"[33]\\n\\nThe first blow against fashionable immorality having been boldly struck,\\nwas followed up systematically. In 1690 was founded \"The Society for the\\nReformation of Manners,\" which published every year an account of the\\nprogress made in suppressing profaneness and debauchery by its means. It\\ncontinued its operations till 1738, and during its existence prosecuted,\\naccording to its own calculations, 101,683 persons. William III. showed\\nhimself prompt to encourage the movement which his subjects had begun. The\\n_London Gazette_ of 27th February, 1698-99, contains a report of the\\nfollowing remarkable order:\\n\\n    \"His Majesty being informed, That, notwithstanding an order made the\\n    4th of June, 1697, by the Earl of Sunderland, then Lord Chamberlain of\\n    His Majesty\\'s Household, to prevent the Prophaneness and Immorality of\\n    the Stage, several Plays have been lately acted containing expressions\\n    contrary to Religion and Good Manners: and whereas the Master of the\\n    Revels has represented, That, in contempt of the said order, the\\n    actors do often neglect to leave out such Prophane and Indecent\\n    expressions as he has thought proper to be omitted. These are\\n    therefore to signifie his Majesty\\'s pleasure, that you do not\\n    hereafter presume to act anything in any play contrary to Religion and\\n    Good Manners as you shall answer it at your utmost peril. Given under\\n    my Hand this 18th of February, 1698. In the eleventh year of his\\n    Majesty\\'s reign.\"\\n\\nIt is difficult to realise, in reading the terms of this order, that only\\nthirteen years had elapsed since the death of Charles II., and undoubtedly\\na very large share of the credit due for such a revolution in the public\\ntaste is to be assigned to Collier. Collier, however, did nothing in a\\nliterary or artistic sense to improve the character of English literature.\\nHis severity, uncompromising as that of the Puritans, inspired Vice with\\nterror, but could not plead with persuasion on behalf of Virtue; his\\nsweeping conclusions struck at the roots of Art as well as of Immorality.\\nHe sought to destroy the drama and kindred pleasures of the Imagination,\\nnot to reform them. What the age needed was a writer to satisfy its\\nnatural desires for healthy and rational amusement, and Steele, with his\\nstrongly-developed twofold character, was the man of all others to bridge\\nover the chasm between irreligious licentiousness and Puritanical\\nrigidity. Driven headlong on one side of his nature towards all the tastes\\nand pleasures which absorbed the Court of Charles II., his heart in the\\nmidst of his dissipation never ceased to approve of whatever was great,\\nnoble, and generous. He has described himself with much feeling in his\\ndisquisition on the _Rake_, a character which he says many men are\\ndesirous of assuming without any natural qualifications for supporting it:\\n\\n    \"A Rake,\" says he, \"is a man always to be pitied; and if he lives one\\n    day is certainly reclaimed; for his faults proceed not from choice or\\n    inclination, but from strong passions and appetites, which are in\\n    youth too violent for the curb of reason, good sense, good manners,\\n    and good nature; all which he must have by nature and education\\n    before he can be allowed to be or to have been of this order.... His\\n    desires run away with him through the strength and force of a lively\\n    imagination, which hurries him on to unlawful pleasures before reason\\n    has power to come in to his rescue.\"\\n\\nThat impulsiveness of feeling which is here described, and which was the\\ncause of so many of Steele\\'s failings in real life, made him the most\\npowerful and persuasive advocate of Virtue in fiction. Of all the\\nimaginative English essayists he is the most truly natural. His large\\nheart seems to rush out in sympathy with any tale of sorrow or exhibition\\nof magnanimity; and even in criticism, his true natural instinct, joined\\nto his constitutional enthusiasm, often raises his judgments to a level\\nwith those of Addison himself, as in his excellent essay in the\\n_Spectator_ on Raphael\\'s cartoons. Examples of these characteristics in\\nhis style are to be found in the _Story of Unnion and Valentine_,[34] and\\nin the fine paper describing two tragedies of real life;[35] in the series\\nof papers on duelling, occasioned by a duel into which he was himself\\nforced against his own inclination;[36] and in the sound advice which\\nIsaac gives to his half-sister Jenny on the morrow of her marriage.[37]\\nPerhaps, however, the chivalry and generosity of feeling which make\\nSteele\\'s writings so attractive are most apparent in the delightful paper\\ncontaining the letter of Serjeant Hall from the camp before Mons. After\\npointing out to his readers the admirable features in the serjeant\\'s\\nsimple letter, Steele concludes as follows:\\n\\n    \"If we consider the heap of an army, utterly out of all prospect of\\n    rising and preferment, as they certainly are, and such great things\\n    executed by them, it is hard to account for the motive of their\\n    gallantry. But to me, who was a cadet at the battle of Coldstream, in\\n    Scotland, when Monk charged at the head of the regiment now called\\n    Coldstream, from the victory of that day--I remember it as well as if\\n    it were yesterday; I stood on the left of old West, who I believe is\\n    now at Chelsea--I say to me, who know very well this part of mankind,\\n    I take the gallantry of private soldiers to proceed from the same, if\\n    not from a nobler, impulse than that of gentlemen and officers. They\\n    have the same taste of being acceptable to their friends, and go\\n    through the difficulties of that profession by the same irresistible\\n    charm of fellowship and the communication of joys and sorrows which\\n    quickens the relish of pleasure and abates the anguish of pain. Add to\\n    this that they have the same regard to fame, though they do not expect\\n    so great a share as men above them hope for; but I will engage\\n    Serjeant Hall would die ten thousand deaths rather than that a word\\n    should be spoken at the Red Lettice, or any part of the Butcher Row,\\n    in prejudice to his courage or honesty. If you will have my opinion,\\n    then, of the Serjeant\\'s letter, I pronounce the style to be mixed, but\\n    truly epistolary; the sentiment relating to his own wound in the\\n    sublime; the postscript of Pegg Hartwell in the gay; and the whole the\\n    picture of the bravest sort of men, that is to say, a man of great\\n    courage and small hopes.\"[38]\\n\\nWith such excellences of style and sentiment it is no wonder that the\\n_Tatler_ rapidly established itself in public favour. It was a novel\\nexperience for the general reader to be provided three times a week with\\nentertainment that pleased his imagination without offending his sense of\\ndecency or his religious instincts. But a new hand shortly appeared in the\\n_Tatler_, which was destined to carry the art of periodical essay-writing\\nto a perfection beside which even the humour of Steele appears rude and\\nunpolished. Addison and Steele had been friends since boyhood. They had\\nbeen contemporaries at the Charter House, and, as we have seen, Steele had\\nsometimes spent his holidays in the parsonage of Addison\\'s father. He was\\na postmaster at Merton about the same time that his friend was a Fellow of\\nMagdalen. The admiration which he conceived for the hero of his boyhood\\nlasted, as so often happens, through life; he exhibited his veneration for\\nhim in all places, and even when Addison indulged his humour at his\\nexpense he showed no resentment. Addison, on his side, seems to have\\ntreated Steele with a kind of gracious condescension. The latter was one\\nof the few intimate friends to whom he unbent in conversation; and while\\nhe was Under-Secretary of State he aided him in the production of _The\\nTender Husband_, which was dedicated to him by the author. Of this play\\nSteele afterwards declared with characteristic impulse that many of the\\nmost admired passages were the work of his friend, and that he \"thought\\nvery meanly of himself that he had never publicly avowed it.\"\\n\\nThe authorship of the _Tatler_ was at first kept secret to all the world.\\nIt is said that the hand of Steele discovered itself to Addison on reading\\nin the fifth number a remark which he remembered to have himself made to\\nSteele on the judgment of Virgil, as shown in the appellation of \"Dux\\nTrojanus,\" which the Latin poet assigns to Æneas, when describing his\\nadventure with Dido in the cave, in the place of the usual epithet of\\n\"pius\" or \"pater.\" Thereupon he offered his services as a contributor, and\\nthese were of course gladly accepted. The first paper sent by Addison to\\nthe _Tatler_ was No. 18, wherein is displayed that inimitable art which\\nmakes a man appear infinitely ridiculous by the ironical commendation of\\nhis offences against right, reason, and good taste. The subject is the\\napproaching peace with France, and it is noticeable that the article of\\nforeign news, which had been treated in previous _Tatlers_ with complete\\nseriousness, is here for the first time invested with an air of\\npleasantry. The distress of the news-writers at the prospect of peace is\\nthus described:\\n\\n    \"There is another sort of gentlemen whom I am much more concerned for,\\n    and that is the ingenious fraternity of which I have the honour to be\\n    an unworthy member; I mean the news-writers of Great Britain, whether\\n    Post-men or Post-boys, or by what other name or title soever dignified\\n    or distinguished. The case of these gentlemen is, I think, more hard\\n    than that of the soldiers, considering that they have taken more towns\\n    and fought more battles. They have been upon parties and skirmishes\\n    when our armies have lain still, and given the general assault to many\\n    a place when the besiegers were quiet in their trenches. They have\\n    made us masters of several strong towns many weeks before our generals\\n    could do it, and completed victories when our greatest captains have\\n    been glad to come off with a drawn battle. Where Prince Eugene has\\n    slain his thousands Boyer has slain his ten thousands. This gentleman\\n    can indeed be never enough commended for his courage and intrepidity\\n    during this whole war: he has laid about him with an inexpressible\\n    fury, and, like offended Marius of ancient Rome, made such havoc among\\n    his countrymen as must be the work of two or three ages to repair....\\n    It is impossible for this ingenious sort of men to subsist after a\\n    peace: every one remembers the shifts they were driven to in the reign\\n    of King Charles the Second, when they could not furnish out a single\\n    paper of news without lighting up a comet in Germany or a fire in\\n    Moscow. There scarce appeared a letter without a paragraph on an\\n    earthquake. Prodigies were grown so familiar that they had lost their\\n    name, as a great poet of that age has it. I remember Mr. Dyer, who is\\n    justly looked upon by all the foxhunters in the nation as the greatest\\n    statesman our country has produced, was particularly famous for\\n    dealing in whales, in so much that in five months\\' time (for I had the\\n    curiosity to examine his letters on that occasion) he brought three\\n    into the mouth of the river Thames, besides two porpusses and a\\n    sturgeon.\"\\n\\nThe appearance of Addison as a regular contributor to the _Tatler_\\ngradually brought about a revolution in the character of the paper. For\\nsome time longer, indeed, articles continued to be dated from the\\ndifferent coffee-houses, but only slight efforts were made to distinguish\\nthe materials furnished from White\\'s, Will\\'s, or Isaac\\'s own apartment.\\nWhen the hundredth number was reached a fresh address is given at Shere\\nLane, where the astrologer lived, and henceforward the papers from White\\'s\\nand Will\\'s grow extremely rare; those from the Grecian may be said to\\ndisappear; and the foreign intelligence, dated from St. James\\', whenever\\nit is inserted, which is seldom, is as often as not made the text of a\\nliterary disquisition. Allegories become frequent, and the letters sent,\\nor supposed to be sent, to Isaac at his home address furnish the material\\nfor many numbers. The Essay, in fact, or that part of the newspaper which\\ngoes to form public opinion, preponderates greatly over that portion which\\nis devoted to the report of news. Spence quotes from a Mr. Chute: \"I have\\nheard Sir Richard Steele say that, though he had a greater share in the\\n_Tatlers_ than in the _Spectators_, he thought the news article in the\\nfirst of these was what contributed much to their success.\"[39] Chute,\\nhowever, seems to speak with a certain grudge against Addison, and the\\nstatement ascribed by him to Steele is intrinsically improbable. It is not\\nvery likely that, as the proprietor of the _Tatler_, he would have\\ndispensed with any element in it that contributed to its popularity, yet\\nafter No. 100 the news articles are seldom found. The truth is that Steele\\nrecognised the superiority of Addison\\'s style, and with his usual\\nquickness accommodated the form of his journal to the genius of the new\\ncontributor.\\n\\n    \"I have only one gentleman,\" says he, in the preface to the _Tatler_,\\n    \"who will be nameless, to thank for any frequent assistance to me,\\n    which indeed it would have been barbarous in him to have denied to one\\n    with whom he has lived in intimacy from childhood, considering the\\n    great ease with which he is able to despatch the most entertaining\\n    pieces of this nature. This good office he performed with such force\\n    of genius, humour, wit, and learning that I fared like a distressed\\n    prince who calls in a powerful neighbour to his aid; I was undone by\\n    my own auxiliary; when I had once called him in I could not subsist\\n    without dependence on him.\"\\n\\nWith his usual enthusiastic generosity, Steele, in this passage, unduly\\ndepreciates his own merits to exalt the genius of his friend. A comparison\\nof the amount of material furnished to the _Tatler_ by Addison and Steele\\nrespectively shows that out of 271 numbers the latter contributed 188 and\\nthe former only 42. Nor is the disparity in quantity entirely balanced by\\nthe superior quality of Addison\\'s papers. Though it was, doubtless, his\\nfine workmanship and admirable method which carried to perfection the\\nstyle of writing initiated in the _Tatler_, yet there is scarcely a\\ndepartment of essay-writing developed in the _Spectator_ which does not\\ntrace its origin to Steele. It is Steele who first ventures to raise his\\nvoice against the prevailing dramatic taste of the age on behalf of the\\nsuperior morality and art of Shakespeare\\'s plays.\\n\\n    \"Of all men living,\" says he, in the eighth _Tatler_, \"I pity players\\n    (who must be men of good understanding to be capable of being such)\\n    that they are obliged to repeat and assume proper gestures for\\n    representing things of which their reason must be ashamed, and which\\n    they must disdain their audience for approving. The amendment of these\\n    low gratifications is only to be made by people of condition, by\\n    encouraging the noble representation of the noble characters drawn by\\n    Shakespeare and others, from whence it is impossible to return without\\n    strong impressions of honour and humanity. On these occasions distress\\n    is laid before us with all its causes and consequences, and our\\n    resentment placed according to the merit of the person afflicted.\\n    Were dramas of this nature more acceptable to the taste of the town,\\n    men who have genius would bend their studies to excel in them.\"\\n\\nSteele, too, it was who attacked, with all the vigour of which he was\\ncapable, the fashionable vice of gambling. So severe were his comments on\\nthis subject in the _Tatler_ that he raised against himself the fierce\\nresentment of the whole community of sharpers, though he was fortunate\\nenough at the same time to enlist the sympathies of the better part of\\nsociety. \"Lord Forbes,\" says Mr. Nichols, the antiquary, in his notes to\\nthe _Tatler_, \"happened to be in company with the two military gentlemen\\njust mentioned\" (Major-General Davenport and Brigadier Bisset) \"in St.\\nJames\\' Coffee-House when two or three well-dressed men, all unknown to his\\nlordship or his company, came into the room, and in a public, outrageous\\nmanner abused Captain Steele as the author of the _Tatler_. One of them,\\nwith great audacity and vehemence, swore that he would cut Steele\\'s throat\\nor teach him better manners. \\'In this country,\\' said Lord Forbes, \\'you\\nwill find it easier to cut a purse than to cut a throat.\\' His brother\\nofficers instantly joined with his lordship and turned the cut-throats out\\nof the coffee-house with every mark of disgrace.\"[40]\\n\\nThe practice of duelling, also, which had hitherto passed unreproved, was\\ncensured by Steele in a series of papers in the _Tatler_, which seemed to\\nhave been written on an occasion when, having been forced to fight much\\nagainst his will, he had the misfortune dangerously to wound his\\nantagonist.[41] The sketches of character studied from life, and the\\nletters from fictitious correspondents, both of which form so noticeable\\na feature in the _Spectator_, appear roughly, but yet distinctly, drafted\\nin the _Tatler_. Even the papers of literary criticism, afterwards so\\nfully elaborated by Addison, are anticipated by his friend, who may fairly\\nclaim the honour to have been the first to speak with adequate respect of\\nthe genius of Milton.[42] In a word, whatever was perfected by Addison was\\nbegun by Steele; if the one has for ever associated his name with the\\n_Spectator_, the other may justly appropriate the credit of the _Tatler_,\\na work which bears to its successor the same kind of relation that the\\nfrescoes of Masaccio bear, in point of dramatic feeling and style, to\\nthose of Raphael; the later productions deserving honour for finish of\\nexecution, the earlier for priority of invention.\\n\\nThe _Tatler_ was published till the 2d of January, 1710-11, and was\\ndiscontinued, according to Steele\\'s own account, because the public had\\npenetrated his disguise, and he was therefore no longer able to preach\\nwith effect in the person of Bickerstaff. It may be doubted whether this\\nwas his real motive for abandoning the paper. He had been long known as\\nits conductor; and that his readers had shown no disinclination to listen\\nto him is proved, not only by the large circulation of each number of the\\n_Tatler_, but by the extensive sale of the successive volumes of the\\ncollected papers at the high price of a guinea apiece. He was, in all\\nprobability, led to drop the publication by finding that the political\\nelement that the paper contained was a source of embarrassment to him. His\\nsympathies were vehemently Whig; the _Tatler_ from the beginning had\\ncelebrated the virtues of Marlborough and his friends, both directly and\\nunder cover of fiction; and he had been rewarded for his services with a\\ncommissionership of the Stamp-office. When the Whig Ministry fell in\\n1710, Harley, setting a just value on the abilities of Steele, left him in\\nthe enjoyment of his office and expressed his desire to serve him in any\\nother way. Under these circumstances, Steele no doubt felt it incumbent on\\nhim to discontinue a paper which, both from its design and its traditions,\\nwould have tempted him into the expression of his political partialities.\\n\\nFor two months, therefore, \"the censorship of Great Britain,\" as he\\nhimself expressed it, \"remained in commission,\" until Addison and he once\\nmore returned to discharge the duties of the office in the _Spectator_,\\nthe first number of which was published on the 1st of March, 1710-11. The\\n_Tatler_ had only been issued three times a week, but the conductors of\\nthe new paper were now so confident in their own resources and in the\\nfavour of the public that they undertook to bring out one number daily.\\nThe new paper at once exhibited the impress of Addison\\'s genius, which had\\ngradually transformed the character of the _Tatler_ itself. The latter was\\noriginally, in every sense of the word, a newspaper, but the Spectator\\nfrom the first indulged his humour at the expense of the clubs of\\nQuidnuncs.\\n\\n    \"There is,\" says he, \"another set of men that I must likewise lay a\\n    claim to as being altogether unfurnished with ideas till the business\\n    and conversation of the day has supplied them. I have often considered\\n    these poor souls with an eye of great commiseration when I have heard\\n    them asking the first man they have met with whether there was any\\n    news stirring, and by that means gathering together materials for\\n    thinking. These needy persons do not know what to talk of till about\\n    twelve o\\'clock in the morning; for by that time they are pretty good\\n    judges of the weather, know which way the wind sets, and whether the\\n    Dutch mail be come in. As they lie at the mercy of the first man they\\n    meet, and are grave or impertinent all the day long, according to the\\n    notions which they have imbibed in the morning, I would earnestly\\n    entreat them not to stir out of their chambers till they have read\\n    this paper; and do promise them that I will daily instil into them\\n    such sound and wholesome sentiments as shall have a good effect on\\n    their conversation for the ensuing twelve hours.\"[43]\\n\\nFor these, and other men of leisure, a kind of paper differing from the\\n_Tatler_, which proposed only to retail the various species of gossip in\\nthe coffee-houses, was required, and the new entertainment was provided by\\nthe original design of an imaginary club, consisting of several ideal\\ntypes of character grouped round the central figure of the Spectator. They\\nrepresent considerable classes or sections of the community, and are, as a\\nrule, men of strongly marked opinions, prejudices, and foibles, which\\nfurnish inexhaustible matter of comment to the Spectator himself, who\\ndelivers the judgments of reason and common-sense. Sir Roger de Coverley,\\nwith his simplicity, his high sense of honour, and his old-world\\nreminiscences, reflects the country gentleman of the best kind; Sir Andrew\\nFreeport expresses the opinions of the enterprising, hard-headed, and\\nrather hard-hearted moneyed interest; Captain Sentry speaks for the army;\\nthe Templar for the world of taste and learning; the clergyman for\\ntheology and philosophy; while Will Honeycomb, the elderly man of fashion,\\ngives the Spectator many opportunities for criticizing the traditions of\\nmorality and breeding surviving from the days of the Restoration. Thus,\\ninstead of the division of places which determined the arrangement of the\\n_Tatler_, the different subjects treated in the _Spectator_ are\\ndistributed among a variety of persons: the Templar is substituted for the\\nGrecian Coffee-House and Will\\'s; Will Honeycomb takes the place of\\nWhite\\'s; and Captain Sentry, whose appearances are rare, stands for the\\nmore voluminous article on foreign intelligence published in the old\\nperiodical, under the head of St. James\\'s. The Spectator himself finds a\\nnatural prototype in Isaac Bickerstaff, but his character is drawn with a\\nfar greater finish and delicacy, and is much more essential to the design\\nof the paper which he conducts, than was that of the old astrologer.\\n\\nThe aim of the Spectator was to establish a rational standard of conduct\\nin morals, manners, art, and literature.\\n\\n    \"Since,\" says he in one of his early numbers, \"I have raised to myself\\n    so great an audience, I shall spare no pains to make their instruction\\n    agreeable and their diversion useful. For which reason I shall\\n    endeavour to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with\\n    morality, that my readers may, if possible, both ways find their\\n    account in the speculation of the day. And to the end that their\\n    virtue and discretion may not be short, transient, intermitting starts\\n    of thought, I have resolved to refresh their memories from day to day\\n    till I have recovered them out of that desperate state of vice and\\n    folly into which the age has fallen. The mind that lies fallow but a\\n    single day sprouts up in follies that are only to be killed by a\\n    constant and assiduous culture. It was said of Socrates that he\\n    brought Philosophy down from heaven to inhabit among men; and I shall\\n    be ambitious to have it said of me that I have brought Philosophy out\\n    of closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and\\n    assemblies, at tea-tables and in coffee-houses.\"[44]\\n\\nJohnson, in his _Life of Addison_, says that the task undertaken in the\\n_Spectator_ was \"first attempted by Casa in his book of _Manners_, and\\nCastiglione in his _Courtier_; two books yet celebrated in Italy for\\npurity and elegance, and which, if they are now less read, are neglected\\nonly because they have effected that reformation which their authors\\nintended, and their precepts now are no longer wanted.\" He afterwards\\npraises the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_ by saying that they \"adjusted, like\\nCasa, the unsettled practice of daily intercourse by propriety and\\npoliteness, and, like La Bruyère, exhibited the characters and manners of\\nthe age.\" This commendation scarcely does justice to the work of Addison\\nand Steele. Casa, a man equally distinguished for profligacy and\\npoliteness, merely codified in his _Galateo_ the laws of good manners\\nwhich prevailed in his age. He is the Lord Chesterfield of Italy.\\nCastiglione gives instructions to the young courtier how to behave in such\\na manner as to make himself agreeable to his prince. La Bruyère\\'s\\ncharacters are no doubt the literary models of those which appear in the\\n_Spectator_. But La Bruyère merely described what he saw, with admirable\\nwit, urbanity, and scholarship, but without any of the earnestness of a\\nmoral reformer. He could never have conceived the character of Sir Roger\\nde Coverley; and, though he was ready enough to satirise the follies of\\nsociety as an observer from the outside, to bring \"philosophy out of\\nclosets and libraries, to dwell in clubs and assemblies,\" was far from\\nbeing his ambition. He would probably have thought the publication of a\\nnewspaper scarcely consistent with his position as a gentleman.\\n\\nA very large portion of the _Spectator_ is devoted to reflections on the\\nmanners of women. Addison saw clearly how important a part the female sex\\nwas destined to play in the formation of English taste and manners.\\nRemoved from the pedestal of enthusiastic devotion on which they had been\\nplaced during the feudal ages, women were treated under the Restoration as\\nmere playthings and luxuries. As manners became more decent they found\\nthemselves secured in their emancipated position but destitute of serious\\nand rational employment. It was Addison\\'s object, therefore, to enlist the\\naid of female genius in softening, refining, and moderating the gross and\\nconflicting tastes of a half-civilised society.\\n\\n    \"There are none,\" he says, \"to whom this paper will be more useful\\n    than to the female world. I have often thought there has not been\\n    sufficient pains taken in finding out proper employments and\\n    diversions for the fair ones. Their amusements seem contrived for\\n    them, rather as they are women than as they are reasonable creatures,\\n    and are more adapted to the sex than to the species. The toilet is\\n    their great scene of business, and the right adjustment of their hair\\n    the principal employment of their lives. The sorting of a suit of\\n    ribands is reckoned a very good morning\\'s work; and if they make an\\n    excursion to a mercer\\'s or a toy shop, so great a fatigue makes them\\n    unfit for anything else all the day after. Their more serious\\n    occupations are sewing and embroidery, and their greatest drudgery the\\n    preparations of jellies and sweetmeats. This, I say, is the state of\\n    ordinary women, though I know there are multitudes of those of a more\\n    elevated life and conversation that move in an exalted sphere of\\n    knowledge and virtue, that join all the beauties of the mind to the\\n    ornaments of dress, and inspire a kind of awe and respect, as well as\\n    of love, into their male beholders. I hope to increase the number of\\n    these by publishing this daily paper, which I shall always endeavour\\n    to make an innocent, if not an improving entertainment, and by that\\n    means, at least, divert the minds of my female readers from greater\\n    trifles.\"[45]\\n\\nTo some of the vigorous spirits of the age the mild and social character\\nof the _Spectator\\'s_ satire did not commend itself. Swift, who had\\ncontributed several papers to the _Tatler_ while it was in its infancy,\\nfound it too feminine for his taste. \"I will not meddle with the\\n_Spectator_,\" says he in his _Journal to Stella_, \"let him _fair sex_ it\\nto the world\\'s end.\" Personal pique, however, may have done as much as a\\ndiffering taste to depreciate the _Spectator_ in the eyes of the author\\nof the _Tale of a Tub_, for he elsewhere acknowledges its merits. \"The\\n_Spectator_,\" he writes to Stella, \"is written by Steele, with Addison\\'s\\nhelp; it is often very pretty.... But I never see him (Steele) or\\nAddison.\" That part of the public to whom the paper was specially\\naddressed read it with keen relish. In the ninety-second number a\\ncorrespondent, signing herself \"Leonora,\"[46] writes:\\n\\n    \"Mr. Spectator,--Your paper is a part of my tea-equipage; and my\\n    servant knows my humour so well that, calling for my breakfast this\\n    morning (it being past my usual hour), she answered, the _Spectator_\\n    was not yet come in, but the tea-kettle boiled, and she expected it\\n    every moment.\"\\n\\nIn a subsequent number \"Thomas Trusty\" writes:\\n\\n    \"I constantly peruse your paper as I smoke my morning\\'s pipe (though I\\n    can\\'t forbear reading the motto before I fill and light), and really\\n    it gives a grateful relish to every whiff; each paragraph is fraught\\n    either with useful or delightful notions, and I never fail of being\\n    highly diverted or improved. The variety of your subjects surprises me\\n    as much as a box of pictures did formerly, in which there was only one\\n    face, that by pulling some pieces of isinglass over it was changed\\n    into a grave senator or a merry-andrew, a polished lady or a nun, a\\n    beau or a blackamoor, a prude or a coquette, a country squire or a\\n    conjuror, with many other different representations very entertaining\\n    (as you are), though still the same at the bottom.\"[47]\\n\\nThe _Spectator_ was read in all parts of the country.\\n\\n    \"I must confess,\" says Addison, as his task was drawing to an end,\\n    \"that I am not a little gratified and obliged by that concern which\\n    appears in this great city upon my present design of laying down this\\n    paper. It is likewise with much satisfaction that I find some of the\\n    most outlying parts of the kingdom alarmed upon this occasion, having\\n    received letters to expostulate with me about it from several of my\\n    readers of the remotest boroughs of Great Britain.\"[48]\\n\\nWith how keen an interest the public entered into the humour of the paper\\nis shown by the following letter, signed \"Philo-Spec:\"\\n\\n    \"I was this morning in a company of your well-wishers, when we read\\n    over, with great satisfaction, Tully\\'s observations on action adapted\\n    to the British theatre, though, by the way, we were very sorry to find\\n    that you have disposed of another member of your club. Poor Sir Roger\\n    is dead, and the worthy clergyman dying; Captain Sentry has taken\\n    possession of a fair estate; Will Honeycomb has married a farmer\\'s\\n    daughter; and the Templar withdraws himself into the business of his\\n    own profession.\"[49]\\n\\nIt is no wonder that readers anticipated with regret the dissolution of a\\nsociety that had provided them with so much delicate entertainment.\\nAdmirably as the club was designed for maintaining that variety of\\ntreatment on which Mr. Trusty comments in the letter quoted above, the\\nexecution of the design is deserving of even greater admiration. The skill\\nwith which the grave speculations of the _Spectator_ are contrasted with\\nthe lively observations of Will Honeycomb on the fashions of the age, and\\nthese again are diversified with papers descriptive of character or\\nadorned with fiction, while the letters from the public outside form a\\nrunning commentary on the conduct of the paper, cannot be justly\\nappreciated without a certain effort of thought. But it may safely be said\\nthat, to have provided society day after day, for more than two years,\\nwith a species of entertainment which, nearly two centuries later, retains\\nall its old power to interest and delight, is an achievement unique in the\\nhistory of literature. Even apart from the exquisite art displayed in\\ntheir grouping, the matter of many of the essays in the _Spectator_ is\\nstill valuable. The vivid descriptions of contemporary manners, the\\ninimitable series of sketches of Sir Roger de Coverley, the criticisms in\\nthe papers on _True and False Wit_ and Milton\\'s _Paradise Lost_, have\\nscarcely less significance for ourselves than for the society for which\\nthey were immediately written.\\n\\nAddison\\'s own papers were 274 in number, as against 236 contributed by\\nSteele. They were, as a rule, signed with one of the four letters C. L.\\nI. O., either because, as Tickell seems to hint in his _Elegy_, they\\ncomposed the name of one of the Muses, or, as later scholars have\\nconjectured, because they were respectively written from four different\\nlocalities--viz., Chelsea, London, Islington, and the Office.\\n\\nThe sale of the _Spectator_ was doubtless very large relatively to the\\nnumber of readers in Queen Anne\\'s reign. Johnson, indeed, computes the\\nnumber sold daily to have been only sixteen hundred and eighty, but he\\nseems to have overlooked what Addison himself says on the subject very\\nshortly after the paper had been started: \"My publisher tells me that\\nthere are already three thousand of them distributed every day.\"[50] This\\nnumber must have gone on increasing with the growing reputation of the\\n_Spectator_. When the Preface of the _Four Sermons_ of Dr. Fleetwood,\\nBishop of Llandaff, was suppressed by order of the House of Commons, the\\n_Spectator_ printed it in its 384th number, thus conveying, as the Bishop\\nsaid in a letter to Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, \"fourteen thousand copies\\nof the condemned preface into people\\'s hands that would otherwise have\\nnever seen or heard of it.\" Making allowance for the extraordinary\\ncharacter of the number, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the usual\\ndaily issue of the _Spectator_ to readers in all parts of the kingdom\\nwould, towards the close of its career, have reached ten thousand copies.\\nThe separate papers were afterwards collected into octavo volumes, which\\nwere sold, like the volumes of the _Tatler_, for a guinea apiece. Steele\\ntells us that more than nine thousand copies of each volume were sold\\noff.[51]\\n\\nNothing could have been better timed than the appearance of the\\n_Spectator_; it may indeed be doubted whether it could have been produced\\nwith success at any other period. Had it been projected earlier, while\\nAddison was still in office, his thoughts would have been diverted to\\nother subjects, and he would have been unlikely to survey the world with\\nquite impartial eyes; had the publication been delayed it would have come\\nbefore the public when the balance of all minds was disturbed by the\\ndangers of the political situation. The difficulty of preserving\\nneutrality under such circumstances was soon shown by the fate of the\\n_Guardian_. Shortly after the _Spectator_ was discontinued this new paper\\nwas designed by the fertile invention of Steele, with every intention of\\nkeeping it, like its predecessor, free from the entanglements of party.\\nBut it had not proceeded beyond the forty-first number when the vehement\\npartizanship of Steele was excited by the Tory _Examiner_; in the 128th\\nnumber appeared a letter, signed \"An English Tory,\" calling for the\\ndemolition of Dunkirk, while soon afterwards, finding that his political\\nfeelings were hampered by the design on which the _Guardian_ was\\nconducted, he dropped it and replaced it with a paper called the\\n_Englishman_. Addison himself, who had been a frequent contributor to the\\n_Guardian_, did not aid in the _Englishman_, of the violent party tone of\\nwhich he strongly disapproved. A few years afterwards the old friends and\\ncoadjutors in the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_ found themselves maintaining an\\nangry controversy in the opposing pages of the _Old Whig_ and the\\n_Plebeian_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\n_CATO._\\n\\n\\nIt is a peculiarity in Addison\\'s life that Fortune, as if conspiring with\\nthe happiness of his genius, constantly furnished him with favourable\\nopportunities for the exercise of his powers. The pension granted him by\\nHalifax enabled him, while he was yet a young man, to add to his knowledge\\nof classical literature an intimate acquaintance with the languages and\\ngovernments of the chief European states. When his fortunes were at the\\nlowest ebb on his return from his travels, his introduction to Godolphin\\nby Halifax, the consequence of which was _The Campaign_, procured him at\\nonce celebrity and advancement. The appearance of the _Tatler_, though due\\nentirely to the invention of Steele, prepared the way for development of\\nthe genius that prevailed in the _Spectator_. But the climax of Addison\\'s\\ngood fortune was certainly the successful production of _Cato_, a play\\nwhich, on its own merits, might have been read with interest by the\\nscholars of the time, but which could scarcely have succeeded on the stage\\nif it had not been appropriated and made part of our national life by the\\nviolence of political passion.\\n\\nAddison had not the genius of a dramatist. The grace, the irony, the\\nfastidious refinement which give him such an unrivalled capacity in\\ndescribing and criticising the humours of men as a _spectator_ did not\\nqualify him for imaginative sympathy with their actions and passions. But,\\nlike most men of ability in that period, his thoughts were drawn towards\\nthe stage, and even in Dryden\\'s lifetime he had sent him a play in\\nmanuscript, asking him to use his interest to obtain its performance. The\\nold poet returned it, we are told, \"with many commendations, but with an\\nexpression of his opinion that on the stage it would not meet with its\\ndeserved success.\" Addison, nevertheless, persevered in his attempts, and\\nduring his travels he wrote four acts of the tragedy of _Cato_, the design\\nof which, according to Tickell, he had formed while he was at Oxford,\\nthough he certainly borrowed many incidents in the play from a tragedy on\\nthe same subject which he saw performed at Venice.[52] It is\\ncharacteristic, however, of the undramatic mood in which he executed his\\ntask that the last act was not written till shortly before the performance\\nof the play, many years later. As early as 1703 the drama was shown to\\nCibber by Steele, who said that \"whatever spirit Mr. Addison had shown in\\nhis writing it, he doubted that he would ever have courage enough to let\\nhis _Cato_ stand the censure of an English audience; that it had only been\\nthe amusement of his leisure hours in Italy, and was never intended for\\nthe stage.\" He seems to have remained of the same opinion on the very eve\\nof the performance of the play. \"When Mr. Addison,\" says Pope, as reported\\nby Spence, \"had finished his _Cato_ he brought it to me, desired to have\\nmy sincere opinion of it, and left it with me for three or four days. I\\ngave him my opinion of it sincerely, which was, \\'that I thought he had\\nbetter not act it, and that he would get reputation enough by only\\nprinting it.\\' This I said as thinking the lines well written, but the\\npiece not theatrical enough. Some time after Mr. Addison said \\'that his\\nown opinion was the same with mine, but that some particular friends of\\nhis, whom he could not disoblige, insisted on its being acted.\\'\"[53]\\n\\nUndoubtedly, Pope was right in principle, and anybody who reads the\\nthirty-ninth paper in the _Spectator_ may see not only that Addison was\\nout of sympathy with the traditions of the English stage, but that his\\nwhole turn of thought disqualified him from comprehending the motives of\\ndramatic composition. \"The modern drama,\" says he, \"excels that of Greece\\nand Rome in the intricacy and disposition of the fable--but, what a\\nChristian writer would be ashamed to own, falls infinitely short of it in\\nthe moral part of the performance.\" And the entire drift of the criticism\\nthat follows relates to the thought, the sentiment, and the expression of\\nthe modern drama, rather than to the really essential question, the nature\\nof the action. It is false criticism to say that the greatest dramas of\\nShakespeare fail in morality as compared with those of the Greek\\ntragedians. That the manner in which the moral is conveyed is different in\\neach case is of course true, since the subjects of Greek tragedy were\\nselected from Greek mythology, and were treated by Æschylus and Sophocles,\\nat all events, in a religious spirit, whereas the plays of Shakespeare are\\nonly indirectly Christian, and produce their effect by an appeal to the\\nindividual conscience. None the less is it the case that _Macbeth_,\\n_Hamlet_, and _Lear_ have for modern audiences a far deeper moral meaning\\nthan the _Agamemnon_ or the _Oedipus Tyrannus_. The tragic motive in Greek\\ntragedy is the impotence of man in the face of moral law or necessity; in\\nShakespeare\\'s tragedies it is the corruption of the will, some sin of the\\nindividual against the law of God, which brings its own punishment. There\\nwas nothing in this principle of which a Christian dramatist need have\\nbeen ashamed; and as regards Shakespeare, at any rate, it is evident that\\nAddison\\'s criticism is unjust.\\n\\nIt is, however, by no means undeserved in its application to the class of\\nplays which grew up after the Restoration. Under that _régime_ the moral\\nspirit of the Shakesperian drama entirely disappears. The king, whose\\ntemper was averse to tragedy, and whose taste had been formed on French\\nmodels, desired to see every play end happily. \"I am going to end a\\npiece,\" writes Roger, Earl of Orrery, to a friend, \"in the French style,\\nbecause I have heard the King declare that he preferred their manner to\\nour own.\" The greatest tragedies of the Elizabethan age were transformed\\nto suit this new fashion; even King Lear obtained a happy deliverance from\\nhis sufferings in satisfaction of the requirements of an effeminate Court.\\nAddison very wittily ridicules this false taste in the fortieth number of\\nthe _Spectator_. He is not less felicitous in his remarks on the\\nsentiments and the style of the Caroline drama, though he does not\\nsufficiently discriminate his censure, which he bestows equally on the\\ndramatists of the Restoration and on Shakespeare. Two main characteristics\\nappear in all the productions of the former epoch--the monarchical spirit\\nand the fashion of gallantry. The names of the plays speak for themselves:\\non the one hand, _The Indian Emperor_, _Aurengzebe_, _The Indian Queen_,\\n_The Conquest of Granada_, _The Fate of Hannibal_; on the other, _Secret\\nLove_, _Tyrannic Love_, _Love and Vengeance_, _The Rival Queens_,\\n_Theodosius, or the Power of Love_, and numberless others of the same\\nkind. In the one set of dramas the poet sought to arouse the passion of\\npity by exhibiting the downfall of persons of high estate; in the other\\nhe appealed to the sentiment of romantic passion. Such were the fruits of\\nthat taste for French romance which was encouraged by Charles II., and\\nwhich sought to disguise the absence of genuine emotion by the turgid\\nbombast of its sentiment and the epigrammatic declamation of its rhymed\\nverse.\\n\\nAt the same time, the taste of the nation having been once turned into\\nFrench channels, a remedy for these defects was naturally sought for from\\nFrench sources; and just as the school of Racine and Boileau set its face\\nagainst the extravagances of the romantic coteries, so Addison and his\\nEnglish followers, adopting the principles of the French classicists,\\napplied them to the reformation of the English theatre. Hence arose a\\ngreat revival of respect for the poetical doctrines of Aristotle, regard\\nfor the unities of time and place, attention to the proprieties of\\nsentiment and diction--in a word, for all those characteristics of style\\nafterwards summed up in the phrase \"correctness.\"\\n\\nThis habit of thought, useful as an antidote to extravagance, was not\\nfertile as a motive of dramatic production. Addison worked with strict and\\nconscious attention to his critical principles: the consequence is that\\nhis _Cato_, though superficially \"correct,\" is a passionless and\\nmechanical play. He had combated with reason the \"ridiculous doctrine in\\nmodern criticism, that writers of tragedy are obliged to an equal\\ndistribution of rewards and punishments, and an impartial execution of\\npoetical justice.\"[54] But his reasoning led him on to deny that the idea\\nof justice is an essential element in tragedy. \"We find,\" says he, \"that\\ngood and evil happen alike to all men on this side the grave; and, as the\\nprincipal design of tragedy is to raise commiseration and terror in the\\nminds of the audience, we shall defeat this great end if we always make\\nvirtue and innocence happy and successful.... The ancient writers of\\ntragedy treated men in their plays as they are dealt with in the world, by\\nmaking virtue sometimes happy and sometimes miserable, as they found it in\\nthe fable which they made choice of, or as it might affect their audience\\nin the most agreeable manner.\"[55] But it is certain that the fable which\\nthe two greatest of the Greek tragedians \"made choice of\" was always of a\\nreligious nature, and that the idea of Justice was never absent from it;\\nit is also certain that Retribution is a vital element in all the\\ntragedies of Shakespeare. The notion that the essence of tragedy consists\\nin the spectacle of a good man struggling with adversity is a conception\\nderived through the French from the Roman Stoics; it is not found in the\\nworks of the greatest tragic poets.\\n\\nThis, however, was Addison\\'s central motive, and this is what Pope, in his\\nfamous Prologue, assigns to him as his chief praise:\\n\\n  \"Our author shuns by vulgar springs to move\\n  The hero\\'s glory or the virgin\\'s love;\\n  In pitying love we but our weakness show,\\n  And wild ambition well deserves its woe.\\n  Here tears shall flow from a more generous cause,\\n  Such tears as patriots shed for dying laws:\\n  He bids your breasts with ancient ardour rise,\\n  And calls forth Roman drops from British eyes.\\n  Virtue confessed in human shape he draws--\\n  What Plato thought, and godlike Cato was:\\n  No common object to your sight displays,\\n  But what with pleasure heav\\'n itself surveys;\\n  A brave man struggling in the storms of fate,\\n  And greatly falling with a falling state.\"\\n\\nA falling state offers a tragic spectacle to the thought and the reason,\\nbut not one that can be represented on the stage so as to move the\\npassions of the spectators. The character of Cato, as exhibited by\\nAddison, is an abstraction, round which a number of other lay figures are\\nskilfully grouped for the delivery of lofty and appropriate sentiments.\\nJuba, the virtuous young prince of Numidia, the admirer of Cato\\'s virtue,\\nPortius and Marcus, Cato\\'s virtuous sons, and Marcia, his virtuous\\ndaughter, are all equally admirable and equally lifeless. Johnson\\'s\\ncriticism of the play leaves little to be said:\\n\\n    \"About things,\" he observes, \"on which the public thinks long it\\n    commonly attains to think right; and of _Cato_ it has not been\\n    unjustly determined that it is rather a poem in dialogue than a drama,\\n    rather a succession of just sentiments in elegant language than a\\n    representation of natural affections, or of any state probable or\\n    possible in human life. Nothing here \\'excites or assuages emotion;\\'\\n    here is \\'no magical power of raising fantastic terror or wild\\n    anxiety.\\' The events are expected without solicitude, and are\\n    remembered without joy or sorrow. Of the agents we have no care; we\\n    consider not what they are doing or what they are suffering; we wish\\n    only to know what they have to say. Cato is a being above our\\n    solicitude; a man of whom the gods take care, and whom we leave to\\n    their care with heedless confidence. To the rest neither gods nor men\\n    can have much attention, for there is not one among them that strongly\\n    attracts either affection or esteem. But they are made the vehicles of\\n    such sentiments and such expressions that there is scarcely a scene in\\n    the play which the reader does not wish to impress upon his memory.\"\\n\\nTo this it may be added that, from the essentially undramatic bent of\\nAddison\\'s genius, whenever he contrives a train of incident he manages to\\nmake it a little absurd. Dennis has pointed out with considerable humour\\nthe consequences of his conscientious adherence to the unity of place,\\nwhereby every species of action in the play--love-making, conspiracy,\\ndebating, and fighting--is made to take place in the \"large hall in the\\ngovernor\\'s palace of Utica.\" It is strange that Addison\\'s keen sense of\\nthe ridiculous, which inspired so happily his criticisms on the\\nallegorical paintings at Versailles,[56] should not have shown him the\\nincongruities which Dennis discerned; but, in truth, they pervade the\\natmosphere of the whole play. All the actors--the distracted lovers, the\\ngood young man, Juba, and the blundering conspirator, Sempronius--seem to\\nbe oppressed with an uneasy consciousness that they have a character to\\nsustain, and are not confident of coming up to what is expected of them.\\nThis is especially the case with Portius, a pragmatic young Roman, whose\\npraiseworthy but futile attempts to unite the qualities of Stoical\\nfortitude, romantic passion, and fraternal loyalty, exhibit him in a\\nposition of almost comic embarrassment. According to Pope, \"the love part\\nwas flung in after, to comply with the popular taste;\" but the removal of\\nthese scenes would make the play so remarkably barren of incident that it\\nis a little difficult to credit the statement.\\n\\nThe deficiencies of _Cato_ as an acting play were, however, more than\\ncounterbalanced by the violence of party spirit, which insisted on\\ninvesting the comparatively tame sentiments assigned to the Roman\\nchampions of liberty with a pointed modern application. In 1713 the rage\\nof the contending factions was at its highest point. The Tories were\\nsuspected, not without reason, of designs against the Act of Settlement;\\nthe Whigs, on the other hand, were still suffering in public opinion from\\nthe charge of having, for their own advantage, protracted the war with\\nLouis XIV. Marlborough had been accused in 1711 of receiving bribes while\\ncommander-in-chief, and had been dismissed from all his employments.\\nDisappointment, envy, revenge, and no doubt a genuine apprehension for the\\npublic safety, inspired the attacks of the Whigs upon their rivals; and\\nwhen it was known that Addison had in his drawers an unfinished play on so\\npromising a subject as _Cato_, great pressure was put upon him by his\\nfriends to complete it for the stage. Somewhat unwillingly, apparently, he\\nroused himself to the task. So small, indeed, was his inclination for it,\\nthat he is said in the first instance to have asked Hughes, afterwards\\nauthor of the _Siege of Damascus_, to write a fifth act for him. Hughes\\nundertook to do so, but on returning a few days afterwards with his own\\nperformance, he found that Addison had himself finished the play. In spite\\nof the judgment of the critics, _Cato_ was quickly hurried off for\\nrehearsal, doubtless with many fears on the part of the author. His\\nanxieties during this period must have been great. \"I was this morning,\"\\nwrites Swift to Stella on the 6th of April, \"at ten, at the rehearsal of\\nMr. Addison\\'s play, called _Cato_, which is to be acted on Friday. There\\nwas not half a score of us to see it. We stood on the stage, and it was\\nfoolish enough to see the actors prompted every moment, and the poet\\ndirecting them, and the drab that acts Cato\\'s daughter (Mrs. Oldfield) out\\nin the midst of a passionate part, and then calling out, \\'What\\'s next?\\'\"\\n\\nMrs. Oldfield not only occasionally forgot the poet\\'s text, she also\\ncriticised it. She seems to have objected to the original draft of a\\nspeech of Portius in the second scene of the third act; and Pope, whose\\nadvice Addison appears to have frequently asked, suggested the present\\nreading:\\n\\n  \"Fixt in astonishment, I gaze upon thee\\n  Like one just blasted by a stroke from heaven\\n  Who pants for breath, and _stiffens, yet alive_,\\n  In dreadful looks: a monument of wrath.\"[57]\\n\\nPope also proposed the alteration of the last line in the play from\\n\\n  \"And oh, \\'twas this that ended Cato\\'s life,\"\\n\\nto\\n\\n  \"And robs the guilty world of Cato\\'s life;\"\\n\\nand he was generally the cause of many modifications. \"I believe,\" said he\\nto Spence, \"Mr. Addison did not leave a word unchanged that I objected to\\nin his _Cato_.\"[58]\\n\\nOn the 13th of April the play was ready for performance, and contemporary\\naccounts give a vivid picture of the eagerness of the public, the\\nexcitement of parties, and the apprehensions of the author. \"On our first\\nnight of acting it,\" says Cibber, in his Apology, speaking of the\\nsubsequent representation at Oxford, \"our house was, in a manner,\\ninvested, and entrance demanded by twelve o\\'clock at noon; and before one\\nit was not wide enough for many who came too late for their places. The\\nsame crowds continued for three days together--an uncommon curiosity in\\nthat place; and the death of Cato triumphed over the injuries of Cæsar\\neverywhere.\" The prologue--a very fine one--was contributed by Pope; the\\nepilogue--written, according to the execrable taste fashionable after the\\nRestoration, in a comic vein--by Garth. As to the performance itself, a\\nvery lively record of the effect it produced remains in Pope\\'s letter to\\nTrumbull of the 30th April, 1713:\\n\\n    \"Cato was not so much the wonder of Rome in his days as he is of\\n    Britain in ours; and though all the foolish industry possible had been\\n    used to make it thought a party play, yet what the author said of\\n    another may the most properly be applied to him on this occasion:\\n\\n        \\'Envy itself is dumb, in wonder lost,\\n        And factions strive who shall applaud him most!\\'[59]\\n\\n    The numerous and violent claps of the Whig party on the one side of\\n    the theatre were echoed back by the Tories on the other, while the\\n    author sweated behind the scenes with concern to find their applause\\n    proceeding more from the hand than the head. This was the case, too,\\n    with the Prologue-writer, who was clapped into a staunch Whig at the\\n    end of every two lines. I believe you have heard that, after all the\\n    applauses of the opposite faction, my Lord Bolingbroke sent for Booth,\\n    who played Cato, into the box, between one of the acts, and presented\\n    him with fifty guineas, in acknowledgment, as he expressed it, for\\n    defending the cause of liberty so well against a perpetual dictator.\\n    The Whigs are unwilling to be distanced this way, and therefore design\\n    a present to the same Cato very speedily; in the meantime they are\\n    getting ready as good a sentence as the former on their side; so\\n    betwixt them it is probable that Cato (as Dr. Garth expressed it) may\\n    have something to live upon after he dies.\"\\n\\nThe Queen herself partook, or feigned to partake, of the general\\nenthusiasm, and expressed a wish that the play should be dedicated to her.\\nThis honour had, however, been already designed by the poet for the\\nDuchess of Marlborough, so that, finding himself unable under the\\ncircumstances to fulfil his intentions, he decided to leave the play\\nwithout any dedication. _Cato_ ran for the then unprecedented period of\\nthirty-five nights. Addison appears to have behaved with great liberality\\nto the actors, and, at Oxford, to have handed over to them all the profits\\nof the first night\\'s performance; while they in return, Cibber tells us,\\nthought themselves \"obliged to spare no pains in the proper decorations\"\\nof the piece.\\n\\nThe fame of _Cato_ spread from England to the Continent. It was twice\\ntranslated into Italian, twice into French, and once into Latin; a French\\nand a German imitation of it were also published. Voltaire, to whom\\nShakespeare appeared no better than an inspired barbarian, praises it in\\nthe highest terms. \"_The first English writer who composed a regular\\ntragedy_ and infused a spirit of elegance through every part of it was,\"\\nsays he, \"the illustrious Mr. Addison. His _Cato_ is a masterpiece, both\\nwith regard to the diction and the harmony and beauty of the numbers. The\\ncharacter of Cato is, in my opinion, greatly superior to that of Cornelia\\nin the _Pompey_ of Corneille, for Cato is great without anything of\\nfustian, and Cornelia, who besides is not a necessary character, tends\\nsometimes to bombast.\" Even he, however, could not put up with the\\nlove-scenes:\\n\\n  \"Addison l\\'a déjà tenté;\\n  C\\'étoit le poëte des sâges,\\n  Mais il étoit trop concerté,\\n  Et dans son Caton si vanté\\n  Les deux filles en vérité,\\n  Sont d\\'insipides personages.\\n  Imitez du grand Addison\\n  Seulement ce qu\\'il a de bon.\"\\n\\nThere were, of course, not wanting voices of detraction. A graduate of\\nOxford attacked _Cato_ in a pamphlet entitled _Mr. Addison turned Tory_,\\nin which the party spirit of the play was censured. Dr. Sewell, a\\nwell-known physician of the day--afterwards satirised by Pope as \"Sanguine\\nSewell\"--undertook Addison\\'s defence, and showed that he owed his success\\nto the poetical, and not to the political, merits of his drama. A much\\nmore formidable critic appeared in John Dennis, a specimen of whose\\ncriticism on _Cato_ is preserved in Johnson\\'s _Life_, and who, it must be\\nowned, went a great deal nearer the mark in his judgment than did\\nVoltaire. Dennis had many of the qualities of a good critic. Though his\\njudgment was often overborne by his passion, he generally contrived to\\nfasten on the weak points of the works which he criticised, and he at once\\ndetected the undramatic character of _Cato_. His ridicule of the\\nabsurdities arising out of Addison\\'s rigid observance of the unity of\\nplace is extremely humorous and quite unanswerable. But, as usual, he\\nspoiled his case by the violence and want of discrimination in his\\ncensure, which betrayed too plainly the personal feelings of the writer.\\nIt is said that Dennis was offended with Addison for not having adequately\\nexhibited his talents in the _Spectator_ when mention was made of his\\nworks; and he certainly did complain in a published letter that Addison\\nhad chosen to quote a couplet from his translation of Boileau in\\npreference to another from a poem on the battle of Ramilies, which he\\nhimself thought better of. But the fact seems to have been overlooked that\\nDennis had other grounds for resentment. In the 40th number of the\\n_Spectator_ the writer speaks of \"a ridiculous doctrine of modern\\ncriticism, that they (tragic writers) are obliged to an equal distribution\\nof rewards and punishments, and an impartial execution of poetical\\njustice.\" This was a plain stroke at Dennis, who was a well-known advocate\\nof the doctrine; and a considerable portion of the critic\\'s gall was\\ntherefore expended on Addison\\'s violation of the supposed rule in _Cato_.\\n\\nLooking at _Cato_ from Voltaire\\'s point of view--which was Addison\\'s\\nown--and having regard to the spirit of elegance infused through every\\npart of it, there is much to admire in the play. It is full of pointed\\nsentences, such as--\\n\\n  \"\\'Tis not in mortals to command success,\\n  But we\\'ll do more, Sempronius, we\\'ll deserve it.\"\\n\\nIt has also many fine descriptive passages, the best of which, perhaps,\\noccurs in the dialogue between Syphax and Juba respecting civilised and\\nbarbarian virtues:\\n\\n  \"Believe me, prince, there\\'s not an African\\n  That traverses our vast Numidian deserts\\n  In quest of prey, and lives upon his bow,\\n  But better practises these boasted virtues.\\n  Coarse are his meals, the fortune of the chase;\\n  Amidst the running streams he slakes his thirst,\\n  Toils all the day, and at th\\' approach of night\\n  On the first friendly bank he throws him down,\\n  Or rests his head upon a rock till morn--\\n  Then rises fresh, pursues his wonted game,\\n  And if the following day he chance to find\\n  A new repast, or an untasted spring,\\n  Blesses his stars, and thinks it luxury.\"\\n\\nBut in all those parts of the poem where action and not ornament is\\ndemanded, we seem to perceive the work of a poet who was constantly\\nthinking of what his characters ought to say in the situation, rather than\\nof one who was actually living with them in the situation itself. Take\\nSempronius\\' speech to Syphax, describing the horrors of the conspirator\\'s\\nposition:\\n\\n  \"Remember, Syphax, we must work in haste:\\n  Oh think what anxious moments pass between\\n  The birth of plots and their last fatal period.\\n  Oh! \\'tis a dreadful interval of time,\\n  Filled up with horror all, and big with death!\\n  Destruction hangs on every word we speak,\\n  On every thought, till the concluding stroke\\n  Determines all, and closes our design.\"\\n\\nCompare with this the language of real tragedy, the soliloquy of Brutus in\\n_Julius Cæsar_, on which Addison apparently meant to improve:\\n\\n  \"Since Cassius first did whet me against Cæsar\\n  I have not slept.\\n  Between the acting of a dreadful thing\\n  And the first motion, all the interim is\\n  Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:\\n  The genius and the mortal instruments\\n  Are then in council; and the state of man,\\n  Like to a little kingdom, suffers then\\n  The nature of an insurrection.\"\\n\\nThese two passages are good examples of the French and English ideals of\\ndramatic diction, though the lines from _Cato_ are more figurative than is\\nusual in that play. Addison deliberately aimed at this French manner. \"I\\nmust observe,\" says he, \"that when our thoughts are great and just they\\nare often obscured by the sounding phrases, hard metaphors, and forced\\nexpressions in which they are clothed. Shakespeare is often very faulty in\\nthis particular.\"[60] Certainly he is; but who does not see that, in spite\\nof his metaphoric style, the speech of Brutus just quoted is far simpler\\nand more natural than the elegant \"correctness\" of Sempronius.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nADDISON\\'S QUARREL WITH POPE.\\n\\n\\nIt has been said that with _Cato_ the good fortune of Addison reached its\\nclimax. After his triumph in the theatre, though he filled great offices\\nin the State and wedded \"a noble wife,\" his political success was marred\\nby disagreements with one of his oldest friends; while with the Countess\\nof Warwick, if we are to believe Pope, he \"married discord.\" Added to\\nwhich he was unlucky enough to incur the enmity of the most poignant and\\nvindictive of satiric poets, and a certain shadow has been for ever thrown\\nover his character by the famous verses on \"Atticus.\" It will be\\nconvenient in this chapter to investigate, as far as is possible, the\\ntruth as to the quarrel between Pope and Addison. The latter has hitherto\\nbeen at a certain disadvantage with the public, since the facts of the\\ncase were entirely furnished by Pope, and, though his account was\\ndissected with great acuteness by Blackstone in the _Biographia\\nBritannica_, the partizans of the poet were still able to plead that his\\nuncontradicted statements could not be disposed of by mere considerations\\nof probability.\\n\\nPope\\'s account of his final rupture with Addison is reported by Spence as\\nfollows: \"Philips seems to have been encouraged to abuse me in\\ncoffee-houses and conversations. Gildon wrote a thing about Wycherley in\\nwhich he had abused both me and my relations very grossly. Lord Warwick\\nhimself told me one day \\'that it was in vain for me to endeavour to be\\nwell with Mr. Addison; that his jealous temper would never admit of a\\nsettled friendship between us; and, to convince me of what he had said,\\nassured me that Addison had encouraged Gildon to publish those scandals,\\nand had given him ten guineas after they were published.\\' The next day,\\nwhile I was heated with what I had heard, I wrote a letter to Mr. Addison\\nto let him know \\'that I was not unacquainted with this behaviour of his;\\nthat, if I was to speak severely of him in return for it, it should not be\\nin such a dirty way; that I would rather tell him himself fairly of his\\nfaults and allow his good qualities; and that it should be something in\\nthe following manner.\\' I then subjoined the first sketch of what has since\\nbeen called my satire on Addison. He used me very civilly ever after; and\\nnever did me any injustice, that I know of, from that time to his death,\\nwhich was about three years after.\"[61]\\n\\nSuch was the story told by Pope in his own defence against the charge that\\nhe had written and circulated the lines on Addison after the latter\\'s\\ndeath. In confirmation of his evidence, and in proof of his own good\\nfeeling for and open dealing with Addison, he inserted in the so-called\\nauthorised edition of his correspondence in 1737 several letters written\\napparently to Addison, while in what he pretended to be the surreptitious\\nedition of 1735 appeared a letter to Craggs, written in July, 1715, which,\\nas it contained many of the phrases and expressions used in the character\\nof Atticus, created an impression in the mind of the public that both\\nletter and verses were written about the same time. No suspicion as to the\\ngenuineness of this correspondence was raised till the discovery of the\\nCaryll letters, which first revealed the fact that most of the pretended\\nletters to Addison had been really addressed to Caryll; that there had\\nbeen, in fact, no correspondence between Pope and Addison; and that,\\ntherefore, in all probability, the letter to Craggs was also a fictitious\\ncomposition, inserted in the so-called surreptitious volume of 1735 to\\nestablish the credit of Pope\\'s own story.\\n\\nWe must accordingly put aside, as undeserving of credence, the poet\\'s\\ningeniously constructed charge, at any rate in the particular shape in\\nwhich it is preferred, and must endeavour to form for ourselves such a\\njudgment as is rendered probable by the acknowledged facts of the case.\\nWhat is indisputable is that in 1715 a rupture took place between Addison\\nand Pope, in consequence of the injury which the translator of the _Iliad_\\nconceived himself to have suffered from the countenance given to Tickell\\'s\\nrival performance; and that in 1723 we find the first mention of the\\nsatire upon Addison in a letter from Atterbury to Pope. The question is,\\nwhat blame attaches to Addison for his conduct in the matter of the two\\ntranslations; and what is the amount of truth in Pope\\'s story respecting\\nthe composition of the verses on Atticus.\\n\\nPope made Addison\\'s acquaintance in the year 1712. On the 20th of\\nDecember, 1711, Addison had noticed Pope\\'s _Art of Criticism_ in the 253d\\nnumber of the _Spectator_--partly, no doubt, in consequence of his\\nperception of the merits of the poem, but probably at the particular\\ninstigation of Steele, whose acquaintance with Pope may have been due to\\nthe common friendship of both with Caryll. The praise bestowed on the\\n_Essay_ (as it was afterwards called) was of the finest and most liberal\\nkind, and was the more welcome because it was preceded by a censure\\nconveyed with admirable delicacy on \"the strokes of ill-nature\" which the\\npoem contained. Pope was naturally exceedingly pleased, and wrote to\\nSteele a letter of thanks under the impression that the latter was the\\nwriter of the paper, a misapprehension which Steele at once hastened to\\ncorrect. \"The paper,\" says he, \"was written by one with whom I will make\\nyou acquainted--which is the best return I can make to you for your\\nfavour.\"\\n\\nThese words were doubtless used by Steele in the warmth of his affection\\nfor Addison, but they also express the general estimation in which the\\nlatter was then held. He had recently established his man Button in a\\ncoffee-house in Covent Garden, where, surrounded by his little senate,\\nBudgell, Tickell, Carey, and Philips, he ruled supreme over the world of\\ntaste and letters. Something, no doubt, of the spirit of the coterie\\npervaded the select assembly. Addison could always find a word of\\ncondescending praise for his followers in the pages of the _Spectator_; he\\ncorrected their plays and mended their prologues; and they on their side\\npaid back their patron with unbounded reverence, perhaps justifying the\\nsatirical allusion of the poet to the \"applause\" so grateful to the ear of\\nAtticus:\\n\\n  \"While wits and Templars every sentence raise,\\n  And wonder with a foolish face of praise.\"\\n\\nPope, according to his own account, was admitted to the society, and left\\nit, as he said, because he found it sit too far into the night for his\\nhealth. It may, however, be suspected that the natures of the author of\\nthe _Dunciad_ and of the creator of Sir Roger de Coverley, though touching\\neach other at many points, were far from naturally congenial; that the\\nessayist was well aware that the man who could write the _Essay on\\nCriticism_ had a higher capacity for poetry than either himself or any of\\nhis followers; and that the poet, on his side, conscious of great if\\nundeveloped powers, was inclined to resent the air of patronage with which\\nhe was treated by the King of Button\\'s. Certain it is that the praise of\\nPope by Addison in number 253 of the _Spectator_ is qualified (though by\\nno means unjustly), and that he is not spoken of with the same warmth as\\nTickell and Ambrose Philips in number 523. \"Addison,\" said Pope to Spence,\\n\"seemed to value himself more upon his poetry than upon his prose, though\\nhe wrote the latter with such particular ease, fluency, and\\nhappiness.\"[62] This often happens; and perhaps the uneasy consciousness\\nthat, in spite of the reputation which his _Campaign_ had secured for him,\\nhe was really inferior to such men as John Philips and Tickell, made\\nAddison touchy at the idea of the entire circle being outshone by a new\\ncandidate for poetical fame.\\n\\nWhatever jealousy, however, existed between the two was carefully\\nsuppressed during the first year of their acquaintance. Pope showed\\nAddison the first draft of the _Rape of the Lock_, and, according to\\nWarburton (whose account must be received with suspicion), imparted to him\\nhis design of adding the fairy machinery. If Addison really endeavoured to\\ndissuade the poet from making this exquisite addition, the latter was on\\nhis side anxious that _Cato_, which, as has been said, was shown to him\\nafter its completion, should not be presented on the stage; and his\\nadvice, if tested by the result, would have been quite as open as\\nAddison\\'s to an unfavourable construction. He wrote, however, for the play\\nthe famous Prologue which Steele inserted, with many compliments, in the\\n_Guardian_. But not long afterwards the effect of the compliments was\\nspoiled by the comparatively cold mention of Pope\\'s _Pastorals_ in the\\nsame paper that contained a glowing panegyric on the _Pastorals_ of\\nAmbrose Philips. In revenge, Pope wrote his paper commending Philips\\'\\nperformance and depreciating his own, the irony of which, it is said,\\nescaping the notice of Steele, was inserted by him in the _Guardian_, much\\nto the amusement of Addison and more to the disgust of Philips.\\n\\nThe occasion on which Pope\\'s pique against Addison began to develop into\\nbitter resentment is sufficiently indicated by the date which the poet\\nassigns to the first letter in the concocted correspondence--viz., July\\n20, 1713. This letter (which is taken, with a few slight alterations of\\nnames, from one written to Caryll on November 19, 1712) opens as follows:\\n\\n    \"I am more joyed at your return than I should be at that of the sun,\\n    so much as I wish for him this melancholy wet season; but it has a\\n    fate too like yours to be displeasing to owls and obscure animals who\\n    cannot bear his lustre. What puts me in mind of these night-birds was\\n    John Dennis, whom I think you are best revenged upon, as the sun was\\n    in the fable upon those bats and beastly birds above mentioned, only\\n    by shining on. I am so far from esteeming it any misfortune, that I\\n    congratulate you upon having your share in that which all the great\\n    men and all the good men that ever lived have had their part of--envy\\n    and calumny. To be uncensured and to be obscure is the same thing. You\\n    may conclude from what I here say that it was never in my thoughts to\\n    have offered you my pen in any direct reply to such a critic, but only\\n    in some little raillery, not in defence of you, but in contempt of\\n    him.\"\\n\\nThe allusion is to the squib called _Dr. Norris\\' Narrative of the Frenzy\\nof John Dennis_, which, it appears, was shown to Addison by Pope before\\nits appearance, and after the publication of which Addison caused Steele\\nto write to Lintot in the following terms:\\n\\n    \"Mr. Lintot,--Mr. Addison desired me to tell you that he wholly\\n    disapproves the manner of treating Mr. Dennis in a little pamphlet by\\n    way of Mr. Norris\\' account. When he thinks fit to take notice of Mr.\\n    Dennis\\' objections to his writings, he will do it in a way Mr. Dennis\\n    shall have no just reason to complain of. But when the papers above\\n    mentioned were offered to be communicated to him he said he could not,\\n    either in honour or conscience, be privy to such a treatment, and was\\n    sorry to hear of it.--I am, sir, your very humble servant.\"\\n\\nPope\\'s motive in writing the pamphlet was, as Johnson says, \"to give his\\nresentment full play without appearing to revenge himself\" for the attack\\nwhich Dennis had made on his own poems. Addison doubtless divined the\\ntruth; but the wording of the letter which he caused a third person to\\nwrite to Lintot certainly seems studiously offensive to Pope, who had,\\nprofessedly at any rate, placed his pen at his service, and who had\\nconnected his own name with _Cato_ by the fine Prologue he had written in\\nits praise. Lintot would of course have shown Pope Steele\\'s letter, and we\\nmay be sure that the lofty tone taken by Addison in speaking of the\\npamphlet would have rankled bitterly in the poet\\'s mind.\\n\\nAt the same time Philips, who was naturally enraged with Pope on account\\nof the ridicule with which the latter had covered his _Pastorals_,\\nendeavoured to widen the breach by spreading a report that Pope had\\nentered into a conspiracy to write against the Whigs, and to undermine the\\nreputation of Addison. Addison seems to have lent a ready ear to these\\naccusations. At any rate Pope thought so; for when the good-natured\\npainter Jervas sought to bring about a composition, he wrote to him (27th\\nAugust, 1714):\\n\\n    \"What you mentioned of the friendly office you endeavoured to do\\n    betwixt Mr. Addison and me deserves acknowledgment on my part. You\\n    thoroughly know my regard to his character, and my propensity to\\n    testify it by all ways in my power. You as thoroughly know the\\n    scandalous meanness of that proceeding, which was used by Philips, to\\n    make a man I so highly value suspect my disposition towards him. But\\n    as, after all, Mr. Addison must be the judge in what regards himself,\\n    and has seemed to be no very just one to me, so I must own to you I\\n    expect nothing but civility from him, how much soever I wish for his\\n    friendship. As for any offices of real kindness or service which it is\\n    in his power to do me, I should be ashamed to receive them from any\\n    man who had no better opinion of my morals than to think me a party\\n    man, nor of my temper than to believe me capable of maligning or\\n    envying another\\'s reputation as a poet. So I leave it to time to\\n    convince him as to both, to show him the shallow depths of those\\n    half-witted creatures who misinformed him, and to prove that I am\\n    incapable of endeavouring to lessen a person whom I would be proud to\\n    imitate, and therefore ashamed to flatter. In a word, Mr. Addison is\\n    sure of my respect at all times, and of my real friendship whenever he\\n    shall think fit to know me for what I am.\"\\n\\nIt is evident, from the tone of this letter, that all the materials for a\\nviolent quarrel were in existence. On the one side was Addison, with\\nprobably an instinctive dislike of Pope\\'s character, intensified by the\\ninjurious reports circulated against Pope in the \"little senate\" at\\nButton\\'s; with a nature somewhat cold and reserved; and with something of\\nliterary jealousy, partly arising from a sense of what was due to his\\nacknowledged supremacy, and partly from a perception that there had\\nappeared a very formidable \"brother near the throne.\" On the side of Pope\\nthere was an eager sensitiveness, ever craving for recognition and praise,\\nwith an abnormal irritability prone to watch for, and reluctant to\\nforgive, anything in the shape of a slight or an injury. Slights and\\ninjuries he already deemed himself to have received, and accordingly, when\\nTickell, in 1715, published his translation of the First Book of the\\n_Iliad_ at the same time with his own translation of the first four books,\\nhis smothered resentment broke into a blaze at what he imagined to be a\\nconspiracy to damage his poetical reputation. Many years afterwards, when\\nthe quarrel between Addison and himself had become notorious, he arranged\\nhis version of it for the public in a manner which is, indeed, far from\\nassisting us to a knowledge of the truth, but which enables us to\\nunderstand very clearly what was passing in his own mind at the time.\\n\\nThe subscription for Pope\\'s translation of the _Iliad_ was set on foot in\\nNovember, 1713. On the 10th October, 1714, having two books completed, he\\nwished to submit them--or at any rate he told the public so in 1735--to\\nAddison\\'s judgment. This was at a date when, as he informed Spence, \"there\\nhad been a coldness between Mr. Addison and me\" for some time. According\\nto the letter which appears in his published correspondence, he wrote to\\nAddison on the subject as follows:\\n\\n    \"I have been acquainted by one of my friends, who omits no\\n    opportunities of gratifying me, that you have lately been pleased to\\n    speak of me in a manner which nothing but the real respect I have for\\n    you can deserve. May I hope that some late malevolences have lost\\n    their effect?... As to what you have said of me I shall never believe\\n    that the author of _Cato_ can speak one thing and think another. As a\\n    proof that I account you sincere, I beg a favour of you: it is that\\n    you would look over the two first books of my translation of Homer,\\n    which are in the hands of Lord Halifax. I am sensible how much the\\n    reputation of any poetical work will depend upon the character you\\n    give it. It is therefore some evidence of the trust I repose in your\\n    good will when I give you this opportunity of speaking ill of me with\\n    justice, and yet expect you will tell me your truest thoughts at the\\n    same time you tell others your most favourable ones.\"[63]\\n\\nWhether the facts reported in this letter were as fictitious as we have a\\nright to assume the letter itself to be, it is impossible to say; Pope at\\nany rate told Spence the following story, which is clearly meant to fall\\nin with the evidence of the correspondence:\\n\\n    \"On his meeting me there (Button\\'s Coffee-House) he took me aside and\\n    said he should be glad to dine with me at such a tavern if I would\\n    stay till those people (Budgell and Philips) were gone. We went\\n    accordingly, and after dinner Mr. Addison said \\'that he had wanted for\\n    some time to talk with me: that his friend Tickell had formerly, while\\n    at Oxford, translated the first book of the _Iliad_. That he now\\n    designed to print it, and had desired him to look it over: he must\\n    therefore beg that I would not desire him to look over my first book,\\n    because, if he did, it would have the air of double dealing.\\' I\\n    assured him that I did not take it ill of Mr. Tickell that he was\\n    going to publish his translation; that he certainly had as much right\\n    to translate any author as myself; and that publishing both was\\n    entering on a fair stage. I then added \\'that I would not desire him to\\n    look over my first book of the _Iliad_, because he had looked over Mr.\\n    Tickell\\'s, but could wish to have the benefit of his observations on\\n    my second, which I had then finished, and which Mr. Tickell had not\\n    touched upon.\\' Accordingly, I sent him the second book the next\\n    morning; and in a few days he returned it with very high commendation.\\n    Soon after it was generally known that Mr. Tickell was publishing the\\n    first book of the _Iliad_ I met Dr. Young in the street, and, upon our\\n    falling into that subject, the doctor expressed a great deal of\\n    surprise at Tickell\\'s having such a translation by him so long. He\\n    said that it was inconceivable to him, and that there must be some\\n    mistake in the matter; that he and Tickell were so intimately\\n    acquainted at Oxford that each used to communicate to the other\\n    whatever verses they wrote, even to the least things; that Tickell\\n    could not have been busied in so long a work there without his knowing\\n    something of the matter; and that he had never heard a single word of\\n    it till this occasion.\"[64]\\n\\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that, after the light that has been\\nthrown on Pope\\'s character by the detection of the frauds he practised in\\nthe publication of his correspondence, it is impossible to give any\\ncredence to the tales he poured into Spence\\'s ear, tending to blacken\\nAddison\\'s character and to exalt his own. Tickell\\'s MS. of the translation\\nis in existence, and all the evidence tends to show that he was really the\\nauthor of it. But the above statement may be taken to reflect accurately\\nenough the rage, the resentment, and the suspicion which disturbed Pope\\'s\\nown mind on the appearance of the rival translation. We can scarcely doubt\\nthat it was this, and this alone, which roused him to such glowing\\nindignation and inspired him to write the character of Atticus. When the\\nverses were made public, after Addison\\'s death, he probably perceived that\\nthe public would not consider the evidence for Addison\\'s collusion with\\nTickell to be sufficiently strong to afford a justification for the\\nbitterness of the satire. It was necessary to advance some stronger plea\\nfor such retaliation, especially as rumour confidently asserted that the\\nlines had not been written till after Addison was dead. Hence the story\\ntold by Pope to Spence, proving first that the lines were not only written\\nduring Addison\\'s lifetime, but were actually sent to Addison himself; and\\nsecondly, that they were only composed after the strongest evidence had\\nbeen afforded to the poet of his rival\\'s malignant disposition towards\\nhim. Hence, too, the publication in 1735 of the letter to Craggs, which,\\ncontaining as it did many of the phrases and metaphors employed in the\\nverses, seemed to supply indirect evidence that both were written about\\nthe same period.\\n\\nWith regard to Pope\\'s story, it is not too much to say that it entirely\\nbreaks down on examination. He professes to give it on the authority of\\nLord Warwick himself, reckoning, of course, that the evidence of\\nAddison\\'s own step-son would be conclusive with the public. But Addison\\nwas not married to the Countess of Warwick till August, 1716; and in the\\nprevious May he had bestowed the most liberal praise on Pope\\'s translation\\nin one of his papers in the _Freeholder_. For Lord Warwick, therefore, to\\nargue at that date that Addison\\'s \"_jealous temper_ could never admit of a\\nsettled friendship\" between him and Pope was out of the question. If, on\\nthe other hand, Lord Warwick told his story to Pope before his mother\\'s\\nmarriage, the difficulty is equally great. The letter to Craggs, which, if\\nit was ever sent to the latter at all, must obviously have been written in\\nthe same \"heat\" which prompted the satire on Atticus, is dated July 15,\\n1715. This fits in well enough with the date of the dispute about the\\nrival translations of the _Iliad_, but not with Lord Warwick\\'s story, for\\nWycherley, after whose death Gildon, we are told, was hired by Addison to\\nabuse Pope, did not die till the December of that year.\\n\\nAgain, the internal evidence of the character itself points to the fact\\nthat, when it was first composed, its \"heat\" was not caused by any\\ninformation the poet had received of a transaction between Addison and\\nGildon. The following is the first published version of the satire:\\n\\n  \"If Dennis writes and rails in furious pet\\n  I\\'ll answer Dennis when I am in debt.\\n  If meagre Gildon draw his meaner quill,\\n  I wish the man a dinner and sit still.\\n  But should there _One_ whose better stars conspire\\n  To form a bard, and raise a genius higher,\\n  Blest with each talent and each art to please,\\n  And born to live, converse, and write with ease;\\n  Should such a one, resolved to reign alone,\\n  Bear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne,\\n  View him with jealous yet with scornful eyes,\\n  Hate him for arts that caused himself to rise,\\n  Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer,\\n  And without sneering teach the rest to sneer;\\n  Alike reserved to blame or to commend,\\n  A timorous foe and a suspicious friend,\\n  Fearing e\\'en fools, by flatterers besieged,\\n  And so obliging that he ne\\'er obliged;\\n  Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike,\\n  Just hint the fault, and hesitate dislike,\\n  _Who when two wits on rival themes contest,\\n  Approves of both, but likes the worst the best_:\\n  Like Cato, give his little senate laws\\n  And sits attentive to his own applause;\\n  While wits and templars every sentence praise\\n  And wonder with a foolish face of praise:\\n  Who would not laugh if such a man there be?\\n  Who would not weep if Addison were he?\"\\n\\nThere is sufficient corroborative evidence to allow us to believe that\\nthese lines were actually written, as Pope says, during Addison\\'s\\nlifetime; and if they were, the character of the satire would naturally\\nsuggest that its motive was Addison\\'s supposed conduct in the matter of\\nthe two translations of the _Iliad_. There is nothing in them to indicate\\nany connection in the poet\\'s mind between Gildon and Addison; on the other\\nhand, the allusion to the \"two wits\" shows the special grievance that\\nformed the basis, in his imagination, of the whole character. Afterwards\\nwe find that \"meaner quill\" is replaced by \"_venal_ quill;\" and the\\ncouplet about the rival translations is suppressed. The inference is\\nplain. When Pope was charged with having written the character after\\nAddison\\'s death, he found himself obliged, in self-defence, to furnish a\\nmoral justification for the satire; and, after his own unfortunate manner,\\nhe proceeded to build up for himself a position on a number of systematic\\nfalsehoods. His story was probably so far true that the character was\\nreally written while Addison was alive; on the other hand, it is not\\nunreasonable to conclude that the entire statement about Gildon and Lord\\nWarwick is fabulous; and, as the assertion that the lines were sent to\\nAddison immediately after their composition is associated with these\\nmyths, this, too, may fairly be dismissed as equally undeserving of\\nbelief.\\n\\nAs to the truth of the character of Atticus, however, it by no means\\nfollows, because Pope\\'s account of its origin is false, that the portrait\\nitself is altogether untrue. The partizans of Addison endeavour to prove\\nthat it is throughout malicious and unjust. But no one can fail to\\nperceive that the character itself is a very extraordinary picture of\\nhuman nature; and there is no reason to suppose that Addison was superior\\nto the weaknesses of his kind. On the contrary, there is independent\\nevidence to show that he was strongly influenced by that literary jealousy\\nwhich makes the groundwork of the ideal character. This the piercing\\nintelligence of Pope no doubt plainly discerned; his inflamed imagination\\nbuilt up on this foundation the wonderful fabric that has ever since\\ncontinued to enchant the world. The reader who is acquainted with his own\\nheart will probably not find much difficulty in determining what elements\\nin the character are derived from the substantial truth of nature, and\\nwhat are to be ascribed to the exaggerated perceptions of Genius.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nTHE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE.\\n\\n\\nThe representation of _Cato_ on the stage was a turning point in the\\npolitical fortunes of the Whigs. In the same month the Queen announced, on\\nthe meeting of Parliament, the signature of the Treaty of Utrecht.\\nWhatever were the merits or demerits of the policy embodied in this\\ninstrument, it offered many points of attack to a compact and vigorous\\nOpposition. The most salient of these was, perhaps, the alleged sacrifice\\nof British commercial interests through the incompetence or corruption of\\nthe negotiators, and on this question the Whigs accordingly raised\\nvehement and reiterated debates. Addison aided his political friends with\\nan ingenious pamphlet on the subject, called _The late Trial and\\nConviction of Count Tariff_, containing a narrative of the lawsuit between\\nthe Count and Goodman Fact, which is written with much spirit and\\npleasantry. It is said that he also took the field in answer to the\\nAddress to the Queen from the magistrates of Dunkirk, wherein Her Majesty\\nwas requested to waive the execution of the article in the Treaty\\nproviding for the demolition of the harbour and fortifications of that\\ntown; but if he wrote on the subject the pamphlet has not been preserved\\nby Tickell. His old friend Steele was meanwhile involving himself in\\ndifficulties through the heat and impetuosity of his party passions.\\nAfter the painful abstinence from partizanship imposed on him by the\\nscheme of the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_ he had founded the _Guardian_ on\\nsimilar lines, and had carried it on in a nonpolitical spirit up to the\\n128th number, when his Whig feelings could restrain themselves no longer,\\nand he inserted a letter signed by \"An English Tory,\" demanding the\\nimmediate demolition of Dunkirk. Soon afterwards he published a pamphlet\\ncalled _The Crisis_, to excite the apprehensions of the nation with regard\\nto the Protestant succession, and, dropping the _Guardian_, started the\\n_Englishman_, a political paper of extreme Whig views. He further\\nirritated the Tory majority in Parliament by supporting the proposal of\\nSir Thomas Hanmer, as Speaker of the House of Commons, in a speech\\nviolently reflecting on the rejected Bill for a Treaty of Commerce with\\nFrance. A complaint was brought before the House against the _Crisis_, and\\ntwo numbers of the _Englishman_, and Steele was ordered to attend and\\nanswer for his conduct. After the charge had been preferred against him,\\nhe asked for time to arrange his defence; and this being granted him,\\nafter a warm debate, he reappeared in his place a few days later, and made\\na long and able speech, which is said to have been prepared for him by\\nAddison, acting under the instructions of the Kit-Kat Club. It did not,\\nhowever, save him from being expelled from the House.\\n\\nAddison himself stood aloof, as far as was possible, from the heated\\natmosphere of party, occupying his time chiefly with the execution of\\nliterary designs. In 1713 he began a work on the Evidences of\\nChristianity, which he never finished, and in the last half of the year\\n1714 he completed the eighth volume of the _Spectator_. So moderate was\\nhis political attitude that Bolingbroke was not without hopes of bringing\\nhim over to the Tory side; an interview, however, convinced him that it\\nwas useless to dream of converting Addison\\'s steady constitutional\\nprinciple to his own ambitious schemes.\\n\\nThe condition of the Tory party was indeed rapidly becoming desperate. Its\\nleaders were at open variance with each other. Oxford, a veteran\\nintriguer, was desirous of combining with the Whigs; the more daring and\\nbrilliant Bolingbroke aimed at the restoration of the exiled Stuarts. His\\ninfluence, joined to natural family affection, prevailed with the Queen,\\nwho was persuaded to deprive Oxford of the Treasurer\\'s staff. But her\\nhealth was undermined, and a furious and indecent dispute between the two\\nTory leaders in her own presence completely prostrated her. She was\\ncarried from the Council, and sinking into a state of unconsciousness from\\nwhich she never recovered, died on the 1st of August, 1714.\\n\\nMeantime the Whigs were united and prepared. On the meeting of the\\nCouncil, George I. was proclaimed King without opposition: Lord-Justices\\nwere authorised to administer affairs provisionally, and Addison was\\nappointed their Secretary. It is said, though on no good authority, that\\nhaving, in discharge of his office, to announce to George I. the death of\\nthe Queen, Addison was embarrassed in his choice of phrases for the\\noccasion, and that the duty to which the best writer in the _Spectator_\\nproved unequal was performed by a common clerk. Had Addison been quite\\nunfamiliar with public life this story would have been more credible, but\\nhis experience in Ireland must have made him acquainted with the\\npeculiarities of official English; and some surviving specimens of his\\npublic correspondence prove him to have been a sufficient master in the\\nart of saying nothing in a magnificent way.\\n\\nOn the arrival of the King in England, the Earl of Sunderland was\\nappointed to succeed the Duke of Shrewsbury as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland,\\nand he once more offered Addison the post of Chief Secretary. In that\\noffice the latter continued till the Earl\\'s resignation of the\\nLord-Lieutenancy in August, 1715. It would appear to have been less\\nlucrative to him than when he previously held it, and, indeed, than he\\nhimself had expected; the cause of this deficiency being, as he states,\\n\"his Lordship\\'s absence from that kingdom, and his not being qualified to\\ngive out military commissions.\"[65] He is said, nevertheless, to have\\nshown the strictest probity and honour in his official dealings, and some\\nof his extant correspondence (the authenticity of which, however, is\\nguaranteed only by the unsatisfactory testimony of Curll) shows him to\\nhave declined, in a very high-minded manner, a present of money, evidently\\nintended to secure his interest on behalf of an applicant. He seems to\\nhave been in London almost as much as in Dublin during his tenure of\\noffice, and he found time in the midst of his public business to compose\\nanother play for the stage.\\n\\nThere appears to be no good reason for doubting that _The Drummer_ was the\\nwork of Addison. It is true that it was not included by Tickell in his\\nedition of his friend\\'s writings; and Steele, in the letter to Congreve\\nwhich he prefixed to the second edition of the play, only says that\\nAddison sent for him when he was a patentee of Drury Lane Theatre, and\\ntold him \"that a gentleman then in the room had written a play which he\\nwas sure I should like, but it was to be a secret; and he knew I would\\ntake as much pains, since he recommended it, as I would for him.\" But\\nSteele could, under such circumstances, hardly have been deceived as to\\nthe real authorship of the play, and if confirmatory evidence is required,\\nit is furnished by Theobald, who tells us that Addison informed him that\\nhe had taken the character of Vellum, the steward, from Fletcher\\'s\\n_Scornful Lady_. Addison was probably not anxious himself to assert his\\nright of paternity to the play. It was acted at Drury Lane, and, the name\\nof the author being unknown, was coldly received; a second performance of\\nit after Addison\\'s death, when the authorship was proclaimed, was\\nnaturally more successful; but, in fact, the piece is, like _Cato_, a\\nstanding proof of Addison\\'s deficiency in dramatic genius. The plot is\\npoor and trivial; nor does the dialogue, though it shows in many passages\\ntraces of its author\\'s peculiar vein of humour, make amends by its\\nbrilliancy for the tameness of the dramatic situation.\\n\\nHe was soon, however, called upon to employ his pen on a task better\\nsuited to his powers. In September, 1715, there was a rising in Scotland\\nand in the North of England on behalf of the Pretender. The rebellion was\\nput down with little difficulty, but the position of the House of\\nBrunswick was far more precarious than on the surface it seemed to be. It\\ncould count, no doubt, on the loyalty of a House of Commons elected when\\nthe Tories were momentarily stunned by the death of Queen Anne, on the\\nfaith of the army, and on the support of the moneyed interest. On the\\nother hand, the two most important classes in the kingdom--the landed\\nproprietors and the clergy--were generally hostile to the new _régime_,\\nand the influence exercised by the latter was of course exceedingly great\\nin days when the pulpit was still the chief instrument in the formation of\\npublic opinion. The weight of some powerful writer was urgently needed on\\nthe Whig side, and Addison--who in the preceding August had been obliged\\nto vacate his office of Secretary in consequence of the resignation of the\\nLord-Lieutenant--was by common consent indicated as the man best qualified\\nfor the task. There were indeed hot political partizans who questioned his\\ncapacity. Steele said that \"the Government had made choice of a lute when\\nthey ought to have taken a trumpet.\" But if by the \"trumpet\" he was\\nmodestly alluding to himself, it may very well be doubted if the objects\\nof the Government would have been attained by employing the services of\\nthe author of the _Englishman_. What was wanted was not party invective,\\nbut the calm persuasiveness of reason; a pen that could _prove_ to all\\nTory country gentlemen and thoroughgoing High Churchmen that the\\nProtestant succession was indispensable to the safety of the principles\\nwhich each respectively considered to be of vital importance. This was the\\ntask which lay before Addison, and which he accomplished with consummate\\nskill in the _Freeholder_.\\n\\nThe name of the new paper was selected by him in order to suggest that\\nproperty was the basis of liberty; and his main argument, which he\\nintroduces under constantly varying forms, is that there could be no\\nsafety for property under a line of monarchs who claimed the dispensing\\npower, and no security for the liberties of the Church under kings of an\\nalien religion. In order to secure variety of treatment, the exact social\\nposition of the _Freeholder_ is not defined:\\n\\n    \"At the same time that I declare I am a freeholder I do not exclude\\n    myself from any other title. A freeholder may be either a voter or a\\n    knight of the shire, a wit or a fox-hunter, a scholar or a soldier, an\\n    alderman or a courtier, a patriot or a stock-jobber. But I choose to\\n    be distinguished by this denomination, as the freeholder is the basis\\n    of all other titles. Dignities may be grafted upon it, but this is the\\n    substantial stock that conveys to them their life, taste, and beauty,\\n    and without which they are blossoms that would fall away with every\\n    shake of wind.\"[66]\\n\\nBy this means he was able to impart liveliness to his theme, which he\\ndiversifies by philosophical disquisition; by good-natured satire on the\\nprejudices of the country gentlemen; by frequent papers on his favourite\\nsubject, \"the fair sex;\" and by occasional glances at literature. Though\\nhis avowed object was to prove the superiority of the Whig over the Tory\\ntheory of the Constitution, his \"native moderation\" never deserts him, and\\nhe often lets his disgust at the stupidity of faction, and his preference\\nfor social over political writing, appear in the midst of his argument.\\nThe best papers in the series are undoubtedly the \"Memoirs of a Preston\\nRebel\" and the \"Tory Foxhunter,\" both of which are full of the exquisite\\nhumour that distinguishes the sketches of Sir Roger de Coverley. The\\n_Freeholder_ was only continued for six months (December 23, 1715, to June\\n9, 1716), being published every Friday and Monday, and being completed in\\nfifty-five numbers. In the last number the essayist described the nature\\nof his work, and gave his reasons for discontinuing it:\\n\\n    \"It would not be difficult to continue a paper of this kind if one\\n    were disposed to resume the same subjects and weary out the reader\\n    with the same thoughts in a different phrase, or to ramble through the\\n    cause of Whig and Tory without any certain aim or method in every\\n    particular discourse. Such a practice in political writers is like\\n    that of some preachers taken notice of by Dr. South, who, being\\n    prepared only upon two or three points of doctrine, run the same round\\n    with their audience from one end of the year to the other, and are\\n    always forced to tell them, by way of preface, \\'These are particulars\\n    of so great importance that they cannot be sufficiently inculcated.\\'\\n    To avoid this method of tautology, I have endeavoured to make every\\n    paper a distinct essay upon some particular subject, without deviating\\n    into points foreign to the tenor of each discourse. They are, indeed,\\n    most of them essays upon Government, but with a view to the present\\n    situation of affairs in Great Britain, so that, if they have the good\\n    fortune to live longer than works of this nature generally do, future\\n    readers may see in them the complexion of the times in which they were\\n    written. However, as there is no employment so irksome as that of\\n    transcribing out of one\\'s self next to that of transcribing out of\\n    others, I shall let drop the work, since there do not occur to me any\\n    material points arising from our present situation which I have not\\n    already touched upon.\"\\n\\nIt was probably in reward for his services in publishing the _Freeholder_\\nthat he was made one of the Commissioners for Trade and Colonies. Soon\\nafter his appointment to this office he married Charlotte, Countess of\\nWarwick, daughter of Sir Thomas Myddleton, of Chirk Castle, Denbighshire.\\nHis attachment to the Countess is said to have begun years before; and\\nthis seems not unlikely, for, though the story of his having been tutor to\\nthe young Earl is obviously groundless, two charming letters of his to the\\nlatter are in existence which show that as early as 1708 he took a strong\\ninterest in the family. These letters, which are written entirely on the\\nsubject of birds, may, of course, have been inspired merely by an\\naffection for the boy himself; but it is not unreasonable to suppose that\\nthe writer felt a yet stronger interest in the mother, though her\\nindifference, or his natural diffidence, led him to disguise his feelings;\\nperhaps, indeed, the episode of Sir Roger de Coverley\\'s love passage with\\nthe cruel widow may be founded on personal experience. We have seen him in\\n1711 reporting to a friend that the loss of his place had involved that of\\nhis mistress. Possibly the same hard-hearted mistress condescended to\\nrelent when she saw her former lover once more on the road to high State\\npreferment.\\n\\nReport says that the marriage was not a happy one. The tradition, however,\\nlike so many others about the same person, seems to have been derived from\\nPope, who, in his _Epistle to Arbuthnot_, congratulates himself--with an\\nevident glance at Addison--on \"not marrying discord with a noble wife.\" An\\ninnuendo of this kind, and coming from such a quarter, ought not to be\\naccepted as evidence without some corroboration; and the only\\ncorroboration which is forthcoming is a letter of Lady Mary Wortley\\nMontagu, who writes from Constantinople in 1717: \"I received the news of\\nMr. Addison\\'s being declared Secretary of State with the less surprise in\\nthat I know the post was offered to him before. At that time he declined\\nit; and I really believe he would have done well to decline it now. Such a\\npost as that and such a wife as the Countess do not seem to be, in\\nprudence, eligible for a man that is asthmatic, and we may see the day\\nwhen he will be glad to resign them both.\" Lady Mary, however, does not\\nhint that Addison was _then_ living unhappily with his wife; her\\nexpressions seem to be inspired rather by her own sharp wit and a personal\\ndislike of the Countess than by any knowledge of discord in the household.\\nOn the other hand, Addison speaks of his wife in a way which is scarcely\\nconsistent with what Johnson calls \"uncontradicted report.\" On March 20th,\\n1718, he writes to Swift: \"Whenever you see England your company will be\\nthe most acceptable in the world at Holland House, where you are highly\\nesteemed by Lady Warwick and the young Lord.\" A henpecked husband would\\nhardly have invited the Dean of St. Patrick\\'s to be the witness of his\\ndomestic discomfort. Nor do the terms of his will, dated only a month\\nbefore his death, indicate that he regarded his wife with feelings other\\nthan those of affection and respect: \"I do make and ordain my said dear\\nwife executrix of this my last will; and I do appoint her to be guardian\\nof my dear child, Charlotte Addison, until she shall attain her age of\\none-and-twenty, being well assured that she will take due care of her\\neducation, and provide for her in case she live to be married.\" On the\\nwhole, it seems reasonable to put positive evidence of this kind against\\nthose vague rumours of domestic unhappiness which, however unsubstantial,\\nare so easily propagated and so readily believed.\\n\\nIn April, 1717, the dissensions between the two sections of the Whig\\nCabinet, led respectively by Townshend and Sunderland, reached a climax,\\nand Townshend being worsted, Sunderland became Prime Minister. He at once\\nappointed his old subordinate one of the Secretaries of State, and Addison\\nfilled the office for eleven months. \"It is universally confessed,\" says\\nJohnson, \"that he was unequal to the duties of his place.\" Here again the\\n\"universal confession\" dwindles on examination to something very\\ndifferent. As far as his conduct in administration required to be defended\\nin Parliament, his inaptitude for the place was no doubt conspicuous. He\\nhad been elected member of Parliament for Lostwithiel in 1708, and when\\nthat election was set aside he was chosen for Malmesbury, a seat which he\\nretained for the rest of his life. He made, however, but one effort to\\naddress the House, when, being confused with the cheers which greeted him,\\nhe was unable to complete his sentence, and, resuming his seat, never\\nagain opened his lips.\\n\\nBut in other respects the evidence of his official incapacity seems to\\nproceed solely from his enemies. \"Mr. Addison,\" said Pope to Spence,\\n\"could not give out a common order in writing from his endeavouring always\\nto word it too finely. He had too beautiful an imagination to make a man\\nof business.\"[67] Copies of official letters and despatches written by\\nAddison are, however, in existence, and prove him to have been a\\nsufficient master of a business style, so that, though his lack of ability\\nas a speaker may well have impaired his efficiency as a member of the\\nGovernment, Johnson has little warrant for saying that \"_finding by\\nexperience his own inability_, he was forced to solicit his dismission\\nwith a pension of fifteen hundred pounds a year.\" As a matter of fact,\\nAddison\\'s own petition to the King and his private correspondence prove\\nwith sufficient clearness that his resignation was caused entirely by his\\nfailing health; while the congratulatory Latin verses addressed to him by\\nVincent Bourne, on his recovery from one of his seizures of asthma, show\\nthat his illness was of the most serious nature.\\n\\nHe resigned his post, however, in March, 1718, with cheerful alacrity, and\\nappears to have looked forward to an active period of literary work, for\\nwe are told that he meditated a tragedy on the death of Socrates, as well\\nas the completion of his book on the Evidences of Christianity. But this\\nwas not to be; the exigencies of the Ministry in the following year\\ndemanded the services of his pen. A Peerage Bill, introduced by\\nSunderland, the effect of which was to cause the sovereign to divest\\nhimself of his prerogative of creating fresh peers, had been vehemently\\nattacked by Steele in a pamphlet called the _Plebeian_, published March\\n14, 1719, which Addison undertook to answer in the _Old Whig_ (March 19).\\nThe _Plebeian_ returned to the attack with spirit and with some acrimony\\nin two numbers published March 29th and 30th, and the _Old Whig_ made a\\nsomewhat contemptuous reply on April 2nd. \"Every reader,\" says Johnson,\\n\"surely must regret that these two illustrious friends, after so many\\nyears passed in confidence and endearment, in unity of interest,\\nconformity of opinion, and fellowship of study, should finally part in\\nacrimonious opposition. Such a controversy was \\'Bellum plusquam _civile_,\\'\\nas Lucan expresses it. Why could not faction find other advocates? But\\namong the uncertainties of the human state we are doomed to number the\\ninstability of friendship.\"\\n\\nThe rupture seems the more painful when we find Steele, in his third and\\nlast _Plebeian_, published April 6th, taunting his opponent with his\\ntardiness in taking the field, at the very moment when his former friend\\nand school-fellow--unknown to him of course--was dying. Asthma, the old\\nenemy that had driven Addison from office, had returned; dropsy\\nsupervened, and he died, 17th June, 1719, at Holland House, at the early\\nage of forty-seven. We may imagine the grief, contrition, and remorse that\\nmust have torn the affectionate heart of Steele when he had found he had\\nbeen vexing the last hours of one whom, in spite of all their differences,\\nhe loved so well. He had always regarded Addison with almost religious\\nreverence, which did not yield even to acts of severity on his friend\\'s\\npart that would have estranged the feelings of men of a disposition less\\nsimple and impulsive. Addison had once lent him £1000 to build a house at\\nHampton Court, instructing his lawyer to recover the amount when due. On\\nSteele\\'s failure to repay the money, his friend ordered the house and\\nfurniture to be sold and the balance to be paid to Steele, writing to him\\nat the same time that he had taken the step to arouse him from his\\nlethargy. B. Victor, the actor, a friend of Steele, who is the authority\\nfor the story, says that Steele accepted the reproof with \"philosophical\\ncomposure,\" and that the incident caused no diminution in their\\nfriendship. Political differences at last produced a coldness between\\nthem, and in 1717 Steele writes to his wife, \"I ask no favour of Mr.\\nSecretary Addison.\" Great must have been the revulsion of feeling in a man\\nof his nature when he learned that death had now rendered impossible the\\nrenewal of the old associations. All the love, admiration, and enthusiasm\\nfor Addison, which his heart and memory still preserved, broke out in the\\nletter to Congreve which he prefixed to _The Drummer_.\\n\\nOf the closing scene of Addison\\'s life we know little except on rumour. A\\nreport was current in Johnson\\'s time, and reached the antiquary John\\nNichols at the close of the last century, that his life was shortened by\\nover-drinking. But as usual the scandal, when traced to its source, seems\\nto originate with Pope, who told Spence that he himself was once one of\\nthe circle at Button\\'s, and left it because he found that their prolonged\\nsittings were injuring his health. It is highly probable that Addison\\'s\\nphlegmatic temperament required to be aroused by wine into conversational\\nactivity, and that he was able to drink more than most of his companions\\nwithout being affected by it; but to suppose that he indulged a sensual\\nappetite to excess is contrary alike to all that we know of his character\\nand to the direct evidence of Bishop Berkeley, who, writing of the first\\nperformance of _Cato_, says: \"I was present with Mr. Addison and a few\\nmore friends in a side box, where we had a table and two or three flasks\\nof Burgundy and champagne, with which the author (who is a very sober man)\\nthought it necessary to support his spirits.\"\\n\\nAnother story, told on the same questionable authority, represents him as\\nhaving sent on his death-bed for Gay, and asked his forgiveness for some\\ninjury which he said he had done him, but which he did not specify. From\\nthe more trustworthy report of Young we learn that he asked to see the\\nEarl of Warwick, and said to him, \"See in what peace a Christian can die:\"\\nwords which are supposed to explain the allusion of the lines in Tickell\\'s\\nelegy--\\n\\n  \"He taught us how to live and (oh! too high\\n  The price of knowledge) taught us how to die.\"\\n\\nHis body, after lying in state in the Jerusalem Chamber, was buried by\\nnight in Westminster Abbey. The service was performed by Atterbury, and\\nthe scene is described by Tickell in a fine passage, probably inspired by\\na still finer one written by his own rival and his friend\\'s satirist:\\n\\n  \"Can I forget the dismal night that gave\\n  My soul\\'s best part for ever to the grave?\\n  How silent did his old companions tread,\\n  By midnight lamps, the mansions of the dead,\\n  Through breathing statues, then unheeded things,\\n  Through rows of warriors, and through walks of kings!\\n  What awe did the slow solemn march inspire,\\n  The pealing organ, and the pausing choir;\\n  The duties by the lawn-robed prelate paid,\\n  And the last words that dust to dust conveyed!\\n  While speechless o\\'er the closing grave we bend,\\n  Accept these tears, thou dear departed friend!\\n  Oh gone for ever; take this last adieu,\\n  And sleep in peace next thy loved Montague.\"[68]\\n\\nHe left by the Countess of Warwick one daughter, who lived in his old\\nhouse at Bilton, and died unmarried in 1797.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\nTHE GENIUS OF ADDISON.\\n\\n\\nSuch is Addison\\'s history, which, scanty as it is, goes far towards\\njustifying the glowing panegyric bestowed by Macaulay on \"the unsullied\\nstatesman, the accomplished scholar, the consummate painter of life and\\nmanners, the great satirist who alone knew how to use ridicule without\\nabusing it; who, without inflicting a wound, effected a great social\\nreform; and who reconciled wit and virtue after a long and painful\\nseparation, during which wit had been led astray by profligacy, and virtue\\nby fanaticism.\" It is wanting, no doubt, in romantic incident and personal\\ninterest, but the same may be said of the life of Scott; and what do we\\nknow of the personality of Homer and Shakespeare? The real life of these\\nwriters is to be found in their work; and there, too, though on a\\ndifferent level and in a different shape, are we to look for the character\\nof the creator of Sir Roger de Coverley. But, while it seems possible to\\ndivine the personal tastes and feelings of Shakespeare and Scott under a\\nhundred different ideal forms of their own invention, it is not in these\\nthat the genius of Addison most characteristically embodies itself. Did\\nhis reputation rest on _Rosamond_ or _Cato_ or _The Campaign_, his name\\nwould be little better known to us than any among that crowd of\\nmediocrities who have been immortalised in Johnson\\'s _Lives of the\\nPoets_. The work of Addison consisted in building up a public opinion\\nwhich, in spite of its durable solidity, seems, like the great Gothic\\ncathedrals, to absorb into itself the individuality of the architect. A\\nvigorous effort of thought is required to perceive how strong this\\nindividuality must have been. We have to reflect on the ease with which,\\neven in these days when the foundations of all authority are called in\\nquestion, we form judgments on questions of morals, breeding, and taste,\\nand then to dwell in imagination on the state of conflict in all matters\\nreligious, moral, and artistic, which prevailed in the period between the\\nRestoration and the succession of the House of Hanover. To whom do we owe\\nthe comparative harmony we enjoy? Undoubtedly to the authors of the\\n_Spectator_, and first among these, by universal consent, to Addison.\\n\\nAddison\\'s own disposition seems to have been of that rare and admirable\\nsort which Hamlet praised in Horatio:\\n\\n                              \"Thou hast been\\n  As one in suffering all that suffers nothing:\\n  A man that Fortune\\'s buffets and rewards\\n  Has ta\\'en with equal thanks; and blessed are those\\n  Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled\\n  That they are not a pipe for Fortune\\'s finger\\n  To sound what stop she please.\"\\n\\nThese lines fittingly describe the patient serenity and dignified\\nindependence with which Addison worked his way amid great hardships and\\ndifficulties to the highest position in the State; but they have a yet\\nmore honourable application to the task he performed of reconciling the\\nsocial dissensions of his countrymen. \"The blood and judgment well\\ncommingled\" are visible in the standard of conduct which he held up for\\nEnglishmen in his writings, as well as in his use of the weapon of\\nridicule against all aberrations from good breeding and common-sense.\\nThose only will estimate him at his true worth who will give, what Johnson\\nsays is his due, \"their days and nights\" to the study of the _Spectator_.\\nBut from the general reader less must be expected; and as the first\\nchapter of this volume has been devoted to a brief view of the disorder of\\nsociety with which Addison had to deal, it may be fitting in the last to\\nindicate some of the main points in which he is to be regarded as the\\nreconciler of parties and the founder of public opinion.\\n\\nI have shown how, after the final subversion by the Civil War of the\\nold-fashioned Catholic and Feudal standards of social life, two opposing\\nideals of conduct remained harshly confronting each other in the\\nrespective moral codes of the Court and the Puritans. The victorious\\nPuritans, averse to all the pleasures of sense and intolerant of the most\\nharmless of natural instincts, had oppressed the nation with a religious\\ndespotism. The nation, groaning under the yoke, brought back its banished\\nmonarch, but was soon shocked to find sensual Pleasure exalted into a\\nworship, and Impiety into a creed. Though civil war had ceased, the two\\nparties maintained a truceless conflict of opinion: the Puritan\\nproscribing all amusement because it was patronised by the godless\\nmalignants; the courtiers holding that no gentleman could be religious or\\nstrict in his morals without becoming tainted with the cant of the\\nRoundheads. This harsh antagonism of sentiment is humorously illustrated\\nby the excellent Sir Roger, who is made to moralise on the stupidity of\\nparty violence by recalling an incident of his own boyhood:\\n\\n    \"The worthy knight, being but a stripling, had occasion to inquire\\n    which was the way to St. Anne\\'s Lane, upon which the person whom he\\n    spoke to, instead of answering his question, called him a young\\n    Popish cur, and asked him who made Anne a saint. The boy, being in\\n    some confusion, inquired of the next he met which was the way to\\n    Anne\\'s Lane; but was called a prick-eared cur for his pains, and,\\n    instead of being shown the way, was told that she had been a saint\\n    before he was born, and would be one after he was hanged. \\'Upon this,\\'\\n    says Sir Roger, \\'I did not think it fit to repeat the former question,\\n    but going into every lane of the neighbourhood, asked what they called\\n    the name of that lane.\\'\"[69]\\n\\nIt was Addison\\'s aim to prove to the contending parties what a large\\nextent of ground they might occupy in common. He showed the courtiers, in\\na form of light literature which pleased their imagination, and with a\\ngrace and charm of manner that they were well qualified to appreciate,\\nthat true religion was not opposed to good breeding. To this class in\\nparticular he addressed his papers on Devotion,[70] on Prayer,[71] on\\nFaith,[72] on Temporal and Eternal Happiness.[73] On the other hand, he\\nbrought his raillery to bear on the super-solemnity of the trading and\\nprofessional classes, in whom the spirit of Puritanism was most prevalent.\\n\"About an age ago,\" says he, \"it was the fashion in England for every one\\nthat would be thought religious to throw as much sanctity as possible into\\nhis face, and, in particular, to abstain from all appearances of mirth and\\npleasantry, which were looked upon as the marks of a carnal mind. The\\nsaint was of a sorrowful countenance, and generally eaten up with spleen\\nand melancholy.\"[74]\\n\\nIt was doubtless for the benefit of this class that he wrote his three\\nEssays on Cheerfulness,[75] in which the gloom of the Puritan creed is\\ncorrected by arguments founded on Natural Religion.\\n\\n    \"The cheerfulness of heart,\" he observes in a charming passage, \"which\\n    springs up in us from the survey of Nature\\'s works is an admirable\\n    preparation for gratitude. The mind has gone a great way towards\\n    praise and thanksgiving that is filled with such secret gladness--a\\n    grateful reflection on the Supreme Cause who produces it, sanctifies\\n    it in the soul, and gives it its proper value. Such an habitual\\n    disposition of mind consecrates every field and wood, turns an\\n    ordinary walk into a morning or evening sacrifice, and will improve\\n    those transient gleams of joy, which naturally brighten up and refresh\\n    the soul on such occasions, into an inviolable and perpetual state of\\n    bliss and happiness.\"\\n\\nThe same qualities appear in his dramatic criticisms. The corruption of\\nthe stage was to the Puritan, or the Puritanic moralist, not so much the\\neffect as the cause of the corruption of society. To Jeremy Collier and\\nhis imitators the theatre in all its manifestations is equally abominable:\\nthey see no difference between Shakespeare and Wycherley. Dryden, who\\nbowed before Collier\\'s rebuke with a penitent dignity that does him high\\nhonour, yet rallies him with humour on this point:\\n\\n  \"Perhaps the Parson stretched a point too far\\n  When with our Theatres he waged a war;\\n  He tells you that this very Moral Age\\n  Received the first infection from the Stage;\\n  But sure a banisht Court with Lewdness fraught\\n  The seeds of open Vice returning brought;\\n  Thus lodged (as vice by great example thrives)\\n  It first debauched the daughters and the wives.\"\\n\\nDryden was quite right. The Court after the Restoration was for the moment\\nthe sole school of manners; and the dramatists only reflected on the stage\\nthe inverted ideas which were accepted in society as the standard of good\\nbreeding. All sentiments founded on reverence for religion or the family\\nor honourable industry, were banished from the drama because they were\\nunacceptable at Court. The idea of virtue in a married woman would have\\nseemed prodigious to Shadwell or Wycherley; Vanbrugh had no scruples in\\npresenting to an audience a drunken parson in Sir John Brute; the merchant\\nor tradesman seemed, like Congreve\\'s Alderman Fondlewife, to exist solely\\nthat their wives might be seduced by men of fashion. Addison and his\\ndisciples saw that these unnatural creations of the theatre were the\\nproduct of the corruption of society, and that it was men, not\\ninstitutions, that needed reform. Steele, always the first to feel a\\ngenerous impulse, took the lead in raising the tone of stage morality in a\\npaper which, characteristically enough, was suggested by some reflections\\non a passage in one of his own plays.[76] He followed up his attack by an\\nadmirable criticism, part of which has been already quoted, on Etherege\\'s\\n_Man in the Mode_, the hero of which, Sir Fopling Flutter, who had long\\nbeen the model of young men of wit and fashion, he shows to be \"a direct\\nknave in his designs and a clown in his language.\"[77]\\n\\nAs usual, Addison improves the opportunity which Steele affords him, and\\nwith his grave irony exposes the ridiculous principle of the fashionable\\ncomedy by a simple statement of fact:\\n\\n    \"Cuckoldom,\" says he, \"is the basis of most of our modern plays. If an\\n    alderman appears upon the stage you may be sure it is in order to be\\n    cuckolded. An husband that is a little grave or elderly generally\\n    meets with the same fate. Knights and baronets, country squires, and\\n    justices of the quorum, come up to town for no other purpose. I have\\n    seen poor Dogget cuckolded in all these capacities. In short, our\\n    English writers are as frequently severe upon this innocent, unhappy\\n    creature, commonly known by the name of a cuckold, as the ancient\\n    comic writers were upon an eating parasite or a vainglorious soldier.\\n\\n    \"... I have sometimes thought of compiling a system of ethics out of\\n    the writings of these corrupt poets, under the title of Stage\\n    Morality; but I have been diverted from this thought by a project\\n    which has been executed by an ingenious gentleman of my acquaintance.\\n    He has composed, it seems, the history of a young fellow who has taken\\n    all his notions of the world from the stage, and who has directed\\n    himself in every circumstance of his life and conversation by the\\n    maxims and examples of the fine gentleman in English comedies. If I\\n    can prevail upon him to give me a copy of this new-fashioned novel, I\\n    will bestow on it a place in my works, and question not but it may\\n    have as good an effect upon the drama as Don Quixote had upon\\n    romance.\"[78]\\n\\nNothing could be more skilful than this. Collier\\'s invective no doubt\\nproduced a momentary flutter among the dramatists, who, however, soon\\nfound they had little to fear from arguments which appealed only to that\\nserious portion of society which did not frequent the theatre. But\\nAddison\\'s penetrating wit, founded as it was on truth and reason, was\\nappreciated by the fashionable world. Dorimant and Sir Fopling Flutter\\nfelt ashamed of themselves. The cuckold disappeared from the stage. In\\nsociety itself marriage no longer appeared ridiculous.\\n\\n    \"It is my custom,\" says the _Spectator_ in one of his late papers, \"to\\n    take frequent opportunities of inquiring from time to time what\\n    success my speculations meet with in the town. I am glad to find, in\\n    particular, that my discourses on marriage have been well received. A\\n    friend of mine gives me to understand, from Doctors\\' Commons, that\\n    more licenses have been taken out there of late than usual. I am\\n    likewise informed of several pretty fellows who have resolved to\\n    commence heads of families by the first favourable opportunity. One of\\n    them writes me word that he is ready to enter into the bonds of\\n    matrimony provided I will give it him under my hand (as I now do) that\\n    a man may show his face in good company after he is married, and that\\n    he need not be ashamed to treat a woman with kindness who puts herself\\n    into his power for life.\"[79]\\n\\nSo, too, in politics, it was not to be expected that Addison\\'s moderation\\nshould exercise a restraining influence on the violence of Parliamentary\\nparties. But in helping to form a reasonable public opinion in the more\\nreflective part of the nation at large, his efforts could not have been\\nunavailing. He was a steady and consistent supporter of the Whig party,\\nand Bolingbroke found that, in spite of his mildness, his principles were\\nproof against all the seductions of interest. He was, in fact, a Whig in\\nthe sense in which all the best political writers in our literature, to\\nwhichever party they may have nominally belonged--Bolingbroke, Swift, and\\nCanning, as much as Somers and Burke--would have avowed themselves Whigs;\\nas one, that is to say, who desired above all things to maintain the\\nconstitution of his country. He attached himself to the Whigs of his\\nperiod because he saw in them, as the associated defenders of the\\nliberties of the Parliament, the best counterpoise to the still\\npreponderant power of the Crown. But he would have repudiated as\\nvigorously as Burke the democratic principles to which Fox, under the\\nstimulus of party spirit, committed the Whig connection at the outbreak of\\nthe French Revolution; and for that stupid and ferocious spirit, generated\\nby party, which would deny to opponents even the appearance of virtue and\\nintelligence, no man had a more wholesome contempt. Page after page of the\\n_Spectator_ shows that Addison perceived as clearly as Swift the\\ntheoretical absurdity of the party system, and tolerated it only as an\\nevil inseparable from the imperfection of human nature and free\\ninstitutions. He regarded it as the parent of hypocrisy and\\nself-deception.\\n\\n    \"Intemperate zeal, bigotry, and persecution for any party or opinion,\\n    how praiseworthy soever they may appear to weak men of our own\\n    principles, produce infinite calamities among mankind, and are highly\\n    criminal in their own nature; and yet how many persons, eminent for\\n    piety, suffer such monstrous and absurd principles of action to take\\n    root in their minds under the colour of virtues! For my own part, I\\n    must own I never yet knew any party so just and reasonable that a man\\n    could follow it in its height and violence and at the same time be\\n    innocent.\"[80]\\n\\nAs to party-writing, he considered it identical with lying.\\n\\n    \"A man,\" says he, \"is looked upon as bereft of common-sense that gives\\n    credit to the relations of party-writers; nay, his own friends shake\\n    their heads at him and consider him in no other light than as an\\n    officious tool or a well-meaning idiot. When it was formerly the\\n    fashion to husband a lie and trump it up in some extraordinary\\n    emergency it generally did execution, and was not a little useful to\\n    the faction that made use of it; but at present every man is upon his\\n    guard: the artifice has been too often repeated to take effect.\"[81]\\n\\nSir Roger de Coverley \"often closes his narrative with reflections on the\\nmischief that parties do in the country.\"\\n\\n    \"There cannot,\" says the _Spectator_ himself, \"a greater judgment\\n    befall a country than such a dreadful spirit of division as rends a\\n    government into two distinct people, and makes them greater strangers\\n    and more averse to one another than if they were actually two\\n    different nations. The effects of such a division are pernicious to\\n    the last degree, not only with regard to those advantages which they\\n    give the common enemy, but to those private evils which they produce\\n    in the heart of almost every particular person. This influence is\\n    very fatal both to men\\'s morals and to their understandings; it sinks\\n    the virtue of a nation, and not only so, but destroys even\\n    common-sense.\"[82]\\n\\nNothing in the work of Addison is more suggestive of the just and\\nwell-balanced character of his genius than his papers on Women. It has\\nbeen already said that the seventeenth century exhibits the decay of the\\nFeudal Ideal. The passionate adoration with which women were regarded in\\nthe age of chivalry degenerated after the Restoration into a habit of\\ninsipid gallantry or of brutal license. Men of fashion found no mean for\\ntheir affections between a Sacharissa and a Duchess of Cleveland, while\\nthe domestic standard of the time reduced the remainder of the sex to the\\nposition of virtuous but uninteresting household drudges. Of woman, as the\\ncompanion and the helpmate of man, the source of all the grace and\\nrefinements of social intercourse, no trace is to be found in the\\nliterature of the Restoration except in the Eve of Milton\\'s still\\nunstudied poem: it is not too much to say that she was the creation of the\\n_Spectator_.\\n\\nThe feminine ideal, at which the essayists of the period aimed, is very\\nwell described by Steele in a style which he imitated from Addison:\\n\\n    \"The other day,\" he writes, in the character of a fictitious female\\n    correspondent, \"we were several of us at a tea-table, and, according\\n    to custom and your own advice, had the _Spectator_ read among us. It\\n    was that paper wherein you are pleased to treat with great freedom\\n    that character which you call a woman\\'s man. We gave up all the kinds\\n    you have mentioned except those who, you say, are our constant\\n    visitants. I was upon the occasion commissioned by the company to\\n    write to you and tell you \\'that we shall not part with the men we have\\n    at present until the men of sense think fit to relieve them and give\\n    us their company in their stead.\\' You cannot imagine but we love to\\n    hear reason and good sense better than the ribaldry we are at present\\n    entertained with, but we must have company, and among us very\\n    inconsiderable is better than none at all. We are made for the cements\\n    of society, and come into the world to create relations amongst\\n    mankind, and solitude is an unnatural being to us.\"[83]\\n\\nIn contrast with the character of the writer of this letter--a type which\\nis always recurring in the _Spectator_--modest and unaffected, but at the\\nsame time shrewd, witty, and refined, are introduced very eccentric\\nspecimens of womanhood, all tending to illustrate the derangement of the\\nsocial order--the masculine woman, the learned woman, the female\\npolitician, besides those that more properly belong to the nature of the\\nsex, the prude and the coquette. A very graceful example of Addison\\'s\\npeculiar humour is found in his satire on that false ambition in women\\nwhich prompts them to imitate the manners of men:\\n\\n    \"The girls of quality,\" he writes, describing the customs of the\\n    Republic of Women, \"from six to twelve years old, were put to public\\n    schools, where they learned to box and play at cudgels, with several\\n    other accomplishments of the same nature, so that nothing was more\\n    usual than to see a little miss returning home at night with a broken\\n    pate, or two or three teeth knocked out of her head. They were\\n    afterwards taught to ride the great horse, to shoot, dart, or sling,\\n    and listed themselves into several companies in order to perfect\\n    themselves in military exercises. No woman was to be married till she\\n    had killed her man. The ladies of fashion used to play with young\\n    lions instead of lap-dogs; and when they had made any parties of\\n    diversion, instead of entertaining themselves at ombre and piquet,\\n    they would wrestle and pitch the bar for a whole afternoon together.\\n    There was never any such thing as a blush seen or a sigh heard in the\\n    whole commonwealth.\"[84]\\n\\nThe amazon was a type of womanhood peculiarly distasteful to Addison,\\nwhose humour delighted itself with all the curiosities and refinements of\\nfeminine caprice--the fan, the powder-box, and the petticoat. Nothing can\\nmore characteristically suggest the exquisiteness of his fancy than a\\ncomparison of Swift\\'s verses on a _Lady\\'s Dressing-Room_ with the\\nfollowing, which evidently gave Pope a hint for one of the happiest\\npassages in _The Rape of the Lock_:\\n\\n    \"The single dress of a woman of quality is often the product of a\\n    hundred climates. The muff and the fan come together from the\\n    different ends of the earth. The scarf is sent from the torrid zone,\\n    and the tippet from beneath the Pole. The brocade petticoat rises out\\n    of the mines of Peru, and the diamond necklace out of the bowels of\\n    Indostan.\"[85]\\n\\nTo turn to Addison\\'s artistic genius, the crowning evidence of his powers\\nis the design and the execution of the _Spectator_. Many writers, and\\namong them Macaulay, have credited Steele with the invention of the\\n_Spectator_ as well as of the _Tatler_; but I think that a close\\nexamination of the opening papers in the former will not only prove,\\nalmost to demonstration, that on this occasion Steele was acting as the\\nlieutenant of his friend, but will also show the admirable artfulness of\\nthe means by which Addison executed his intention. The purpose of the\\n_Spectator_ is described in the tenth number, which is by Addison:\\n\\n    \"I shall endeavour,\" said he, \"to enliven morality with wit, and to\\n    temper wit with morality, that my readers may, if possible, both ways\\n    find their account in the speculation of the day. And to the end that\\n    their virtue and discretion may not be short, transient, intermitting\\n    starts of thought, I have resolved to refresh their memories from day\\n    to day till I have recovered them out of that desperate state of vice\\n    and folly into which the age has fallen.\"\\n\\nThat is to say, his design was \"to hold as \\'twere the mirror up to\\nnature,\" so that the conscience of society might recognise in a dramatic\\nform the character of its lapses from virtue and reason. The indispensable\\ninstrument for the execution of this design was the _Spectator_ himself,\\nthe silent embodiment of right reason and good taste, who is obviously the\\nconception of Addison.\\n\\n    \"I live in the world rather as a spectator of mankind than as one of\\n    the species by which means I have made myself a speculative statesman,\\n    soldier, merchant, and artizan, without ever meddling with any\\n    practical part in life. I am very well versed in the theory of a\\n    husband, or a father, and can discern the errors in the economy,\\n    business, and diversion of others better than those who are engaged in\\n    them, as standers-by discover blots which are apt to escape those who\\n    are in the game. I never espoused any party with violence, and am\\n    resolved to observe an exact neutrality between the Whigs and Tories\\n    unless I shall be forced to declare myself by the hostilities of\\n    either side. In short, I have acted in all the parts of my life as a\\n    looker-on, which is the character I intend to preserve in this paper.\"\\n\\nIn order, however, to give this somewhat inanimate figure life and action,\\nhe is represented as the principal member of a club, his associates\\nconsisting of various representatives of the chief \"interests\" of society.\\nWe can scarcely doubt that the club was part of the original and central\\nconception of the work; and if this be so, a new light is thrown on some\\nof the features in the characters of the _Spectator_ which have hitherto\\nrather perplexed the critics.\\n\\n    \"The _Spectator\\'s_ friends,\" says Macaulay, \"were first sketched by\\n    Steele. Four of the club--the templar, the clergyman, the soldier, and\\n    the merchant--were uninteresting figures, fit only for a background.\\n    But the other two--an old country baronet and an old town rake--though\\n    not delineated with a very delicate pencil, had some good strokes.\\n    Addison took the rude outlines into his own hands, retouched them,\\n    coloured them, and is in truth the creator of the Sir Roger de\\n    Coverley and the Will Honeycomb with whom we are all familiar.\"\\n\\nThis is a very misleading account of the matter. It implies that the\\ncharacters in the _Spectator_ were mere casual conceptions of Steele\\'s;\\nthat Addison knew nothing about them till he saw Steele\\'s rough draft; and\\nthat he, and he alone, is the creator of the finished character of Sir\\nRoger de Coverley. But, as a matter of fact, the character of Sir Roger is\\nfull of contradictions and inconsistencies; and the want of unity which it\\npresents is easily explained by the fact that it is the work of four\\ndifferent hands. Sixteen papers on the subject were contributed by\\nAddison, seven by Steele, three by Budgell, and one by Tickell. Had Sir\\nRoger been, as Macaulay seems to suggest, merely the stray phantom of\\nSteele\\'s imagination, it is very unlikely that so many different painters\\nshould have busied themselves with his portrait. But he was from the first\\nintended to be a _type_ of a country gentleman, just as much as Don\\nQuixote was an imaginative representation of many Spanish gentlemen whose\\nbrains had been turned by the reading of romances. In both cases the type\\nof character was so common and so truly conceived as to lend itself easily\\nto the treatment of writers who approached it with various conceptions and\\nvery unequal degrees of skill. Any critic, therefore, who regards Sir\\nRoger de Coverley as the abstract conception of a single mind is certain\\nto misconceive the character. This error lies at the root of Johnson\\'s\\ndescription of the knight:\\n\\n    \"Of the characters,\" says he, \"feigned or exhibited in the\\n    _Spectator_, the favourite of Addison was Sir Roger de Coverley, of\\n    whom he had formed a very delicate and discriminated idea, which he\\n    would not suffer to be violated; and therefore when Steele had shown\\n    him innocently picking up a girl in the Temple and taking her to a\\n    tavern, he drew upon himself so much of his friend\\'s indignation that\\n    he was forced to appease him by a promise of forbearing Sir Roger for\\n    the time to come.... It may be doubted whether Addison ever filled up\\n    his original delineation. He describes his knight as having his\\n    imagination somewhat warped; but of this perversion he has made very\\n    little use. The irregularities in Sir Roger\\'s conduct seem not so much\\n    the effects of a mind deviating from the beaten track of life, by the\\n    perpetual pressure of some overwhelming idea, as of habitual rusticity\\n    and that negligence which solitary grandeur naturally generates. The\\n    variable weather of the mind, the flying vapours of incipient madness,\\n    which from time to time cloud reason without eclipsing it, it requires\\n    so much nicety to exhibit, that Addison seems to have been deterred\\n    from prosecuting his own design.\"\\n\\nBut Addison never had any design of the kind. Steele, indeed, describes\\nSir Roger in the second number of the _Spectator_ as \"a gentleman that is\\nvery singular in his behaviour,\" but he added that \"his singularities\\nproceed from his good sense, and are contradictions to the manners of the\\nworld, only, as he thinks, the world is in the wrong.\" Addison regarded\\nthe knight from a different point of view. \"My friend Sir Roger,\" he says,\\n\"amidst all his good qualities is _something of a humourist_; his virtues\\nas well as imperfections are, as it were, tinged by a certain extravagance\\nwhich makes them particularly his, and distinguishes them from those of\\nother men. This cast of mind, as it is generally very innocent in itself,\\nso it renders his conversation highly agreeable and more delightful than\\nthe same degree of sense and virtue would appear in their common and\\nordinary colours.\"\\n\\nThe fact is, as I have already said, that it had evidently been\\npredetermined by the designers of the _Spectator_ that the Club should\\nconsist of certain recognised and familiar types; the different writers,\\nin turns, worked on these types, each for his own purpose and according to\\nthe bent of his own genius. Steele gave the first sketch of Sir Roger in a\\nfew rough but vigorous strokes, which were afterwards greatly refined and\\naltered by Addison. In Steele\\'s hands the knight appears indeed as a\\ncountry squire, but he has also a town-house in Soho Square, then the most\\nfashionable part of London. He had apparently been originally \"a fine\\ngentleman,\" and only acquired his old-fashioned rusticity of manners in\\nconsequence of a disappointment in love. All his oddities date from this\\nadventure, though his heart has outlived the effects of it. \"There is,\" we\\nare told, \"such a mirthful cast in his behaviour that he is rather beloved\\nthan esteemed.\" Steele\\'s imagination had evidently been chiefly caught by\\nthe humour of Sir Roger\\'s love affair, which is made to reflect the\\nromantic cast of poetry affected after the Restoration, and forms the\\nsubject of two papers in the series; in two others--recording respectively\\nthe knight\\'s kindness to his servants, and his remarks on the portraits of\\nhis ancestors--the writer takes up the idea of Addison; while another\\ngives an account of a dispute between Sir Roger and Sir Andrew Freeport on\\nthe merits of the moneyed interest. Addison, on the other hand, had formed\\na far finer conception of the character of the country gentleman, and one\\nthat approaches the portrait of Don Quixote. As a humourist he perceived\\nthe incongruous position in modern society of one nourished in the\\nbeliefs, principles, and traditions of the old feudal world; and hence,\\nwhenever the knight is brought into contact with modern ideas, he invests\\nhis observations, as the _Spectator_ says, with \"a certain extravagance\"\\nwhich constitutes their charm. Such are the papers describing his\\nbehaviour at church, his inclination to believe in witchcraft, and his\\nTory principles; such, in another vein, are his criticisms in the theatre,\\nhis opinions of Spring Gardens, and his delightful reflections on the\\ntombs in Westminster Abbey. But Addison was also fully alive to the beauty\\nand nobility of the feudal idea, which he brings out with great animation\\nin the various papers describing the patriarchal relations existing\\nbetween Sir Roger and his servants, retainers, and tenants, closing the\\nseries with the truly pathetic account of the knight\\'s death. It is to be\\nobserved that he drops altogether Steele\\'s idea of Sir Roger having once\\nbeen a man of fashion, which is indeed discarded by Steele himself when\\nco-operating with his friend on the picture of country life. Addison also\\nquite disregards Steele\\'s original hint about \"the humble desires\" of his\\nhero; and he only once makes incidental mention of the widow.\\n\\nBudgell contributed three papers on the subject--two in imitation of\\nAddison; one describing a fox-hunt, and the other giving Sir Roger\\'s\\nopinion on beards; the third, in imitation of Steele, showing Sir Roger\\'s\\nstate of mind on hearing of the addresses of Sir David Dundrum to the\\nwidow. The number of the _Spectator_ which is said to have so greatly\\ndispleased Addison was written, not, as Johnson says, by Steele, but by\\nTickell. It goes far to confirm my supposition that the characters of the\\nClub had been agreed upon beforehand. The trait which Tickell describes\\nwould have been natural enough in an ordinary country gentleman, though it\\nwas inconsistent with the fine development of Sir Roger\\'s character in the\\nhands of Addison.\\n\\nIn his capacity of critic Addison has been variously judged, and, it may\\nbe added, generally undervalued. We find that Johnson\\'s contemporaries\\nwere reluctant to allow him the name of critic. \"His criticism,\" Johnson\\nexplains, \"is condemned as tentative or experimental rather than\\nscientific; and he is considered as deciding by taste rather than by\\nprinciples.\" But if Aristotle is right in saying that the virtuous man is\\nthe standard of virtue, the man of sound instincts and perceptions ought\\ncertainly to be accepted as a standard in the more debatable region of\\ntaste. There can, at any rate, be no doubt that Addison\\'s artistic\\njudgments, founded on instinct, were frequently much nearer the mark than\\nJohnson\\'s, though these were based on principle. Again, Macaulay says,\\n\"The least valuable of Addison\\'s contributions to the _Spectator_ are, in\\nthe judgment of our age, his critical papers;\" but he adds, patronisingly,\\n\"The very worst of them is creditable to him when the character of the\\nschool in which he had been trained is fairly considered. The best of them\\nwere much too good for his readers. In truth, he was not so far behind our\\ngeneration as he was before his own.\" By \"the school in which he had been\\ntrained,\" Macaulay doubtless meant the critical traditions established by\\nBoileau and Bouhours, and he would have justified the disparagement\\nimplied in his reference to them by pointing to the pedantic intolerance\\nand narrowness of view which these traditions encouraged. But in all\\nmatters of this kind there is loss and gain. If Addison\\'s generation was\\nmuch more insensible than our own to a large portion of imaginative truth,\\nit had a far keener perception of the laws and limits of expression; and,\\ngranted that Voltaire was wrong in regarding Shakespeare as an \"inspired\\nbarbarian,\" he would never have made the mistake which critics now make\\nevery day of mistaking nonsense for poetry.\\n\\nBut it may well be questioned if Addison\\'s criticism is only \"tentative\\nand experimental.\" The end of criticism is surely to produce a habit of\\nreasoning rightly on matters of taste and imagination; and, with the\\nexception of Sir Joshua Reynolds, no English critic has accomplished more\\nin this direction than Addison. Before his time Dryden had scattered over\\na number of prefaces various critical remarks, admirably felicitous in\\nthought and racy in expression. But he had made no attempt to write upon\\nthe subject systematically; and in practice he gave himself up without an\\neffort to satisfy the tastes which a corrupt Court had formed, partly on\\nthe \"false wit\" of Cowley\\'s following, partly on the extravagance and\\nconceit of the French school of Romance. Addison, on the other hand, set\\nhimself to correct this depraved fashion by establishing in England, on a\\nlarger and more liberal basis, the standards of good breeding and\\ncommon-sense which Boileau had already popularised in France. Nothing can\\nbe more just and discriminating than his papers on the difference between\\ntrue and false wit.[86] He was the first to endeavour to define the limits\\nof art and taste in his essays on the _Pleasures of the Imagination_;[87]\\nand though his theory on the subject is obviously superficial, it\\nsufficiently proves that his method of reasoning on questions of taste was\\nmuch more than \"tentative and experimental.\" \"I could wish,\" he says,\\n\"there were authors who, beside the mechanical rules which a man of very\\nlittle taste may discourse upon, would enter into the very spirit and soul\\nof fine writing, and show us the several sources of that pleasure which\\nrises in the mind on the perusal of a noble work.\" His studies of the\\nFrench drama prevented him from appreciating the great Elizabethan school\\nof tragedy, yet many stray remarks in the _Spectator_ show how deeply he\\nwas impressed by the greatness of Shakespeare\\'s genius, while his\\ncriticisms on Tragedy did much to banish the tumid extravagance of the\\nromantic style. His papers on Milton achieved the triumph of making a\\npractically unknown poem one of the most popular classics in the language,\\nand he was more than half a century before his age in his appreciation of\\nthe beauties of the English ballads. In fact, finding English taste in\\nhopeless confusion, he left it in admirable order; and to those who are\\ninclined to depreciate his powers as a critic the following observations\\nof Johnson--not a very favourable judge--may be commended:\\n\\n    \"It is not uncommon for those who have grown wise by the labour of\\n    others to add a little of their own, and overlook their masters.\\n    Addison is now despised by some who perhaps would never have seen his\\n    defects but by the light he afforded them. That he always wrote as he\\n    would write now cannot be affirmed; his instructions were such as the\\n    characters of his readers made proper. That general knowledge which\\n    now circulates in common talk was in his time rarely to be found. Men\\n    not professing learning were not ashamed of ignorance; and in the\\n    female world any acquaintance with books was distinguished only to be\\n    censured. His purpose was to infuse literary curiosity by gentle and\\n    unsuspected conveyance into the gay, the idle, and the wealthy; he\\n    therefore presented knowledge in the most alluring form, not lofty and\\n    austere, but accessible and familiar. When he showed them their\\n    defects, he showed them likewise that they might be easily supplied.\\n    His attempt succeeded; inquiry awakened and comprehension expanded. An\\n    emulation of intellectual elegance was excited, and from this time to\\n    our own life has been gradually exalted, and conversation purified and\\n    enlarged.\"[88]\\n\\nThe essence of Addison\\'s humour is irony. \"One slight lineament of his\\ncharacter,\" says Johnson, \"Swift has preserved. It was his practice, when\\nhe found any man invincibly wrong, to flatter his opinions by acquiescence\\nand sink him yet deeper to absurdity.\" The same characteristic manifests\\nitself in his writings under a great variety of forms. Sometimes it\\nappears in the seemingly logical premises from which he draws an obviously\\nabsurd conclusion, as for instance:\\n\\n    \"If in a multitude of counsellors there is safety, we ought to think\\n    ourselves the securest nation in the world. Most of our garrets are\\n    inhabited by statesmen, who watch over the liberties of their country,\\n    and make a shift to keep themselves from starving by taking into their\\n    care the properties of all their fellow-subjects.\"[89]\\n\\nOn other occasions he ridicules some fashion of taste by a perfectly grave\\nand simple description of its object. Perhaps the most admirable specimen\\nof this oblique manner is his satire on the Italian opera in the number of\\nthe _Spectator_ describing the various lions who had fought on the stage\\nwith Nicolini. This highly-finished paper deserves to be quoted _in\\nextenso_:\\n\\n    \"There is nothing of late years has afforded matter of greater\\n    amusement to the town than Signor Nicolini\\'s combat with a lion in the\\n    Haymarket, which has been very often exhibited to the general\\n    satisfaction of most of the nobility and gentry in the kingdom of\\n    Great Britain. Upon the first rumour of this intended combat it was\\n    confidently affirmed, and is still believed by many in both galleries,\\n    that there would be a tame lion sent from the tower every opera in\\n    order to be killed by Hydaspes. This report, though altogether\\n    groundless, so universally prevailed in the upper regions of the\\n    playhouse, that some of the refined politicians in those parts of the\\n    audience gave it out in a whisper that the lion was a cousin-german of\\n    the tiger who made his appearance in King William\\'s days, and that the\\n    stage would be supplied with lions at the public expense during the\\n    whole session. Many, likewise, were the conjectures of the treatment\\n    which this lion was to meet with at the hands of Signor Nicolini;\\n    some supposed that he was to subdue him in recitativo, as Orpheus used\\n    to serve the wild beasts in his time, and afterwards to knock him on\\n    the head; some fancied that the lion would not pretend to lay his paws\\n    upon the hero, by reason of the received opinion that a lion will not\\n    hurt a virgin; several, who pretended to have seen the opera in Italy,\\n    had informed their friends that the lion was to act a part in High\\n    Dutch, and roar twice or thrice to a thorough-bass before he fell at\\n    the feet of Hydaspes. To clear up a matter that was so variously\\n    reported, I have made it my business to examine whether this pretended\\n    lion is really the savage he appears to be or only a counterfeit.\\n\\n    \"But, before I communicate my discoveries, I must acquaint the public\\n    that upon my walking behind the scenes last winter, as I was thinking\\n    upon something else, I accidentally jostled against an enormous animal\\n    that extremely startled me, and, upon my nearer survey of it, appeared\\n    to be a lion rampant. The lion, seeing me very much surprised, told\\n    me, in a gentle voice, that I might come by him if I pleased; \\'for,\\'\\n    says he, \\'I do not intend to hurt anybody.\\' I thanked him very kindly\\n    and passed by him, and in a little time after saw him leap upon the\\n    stage and act his part with very great applause. It has been observed\\n    by several that the lion has changed his manner of acting twice or\\n    thrice since his first appearance; which will not seem strange when I\\n    acquaint my reader that the lion has been changed upon the audience\\n    three several times. The first lion was a candle-snuffer, who, being a\\n    fellow of testy, choleric temper, overdid his part, and would not\\n    suffer himself to be killed so easily as he ought to have done;\\n    besides, it was observed of him that he became more surly every time\\n    he came out of the lion; and having dropped some words in ordinary\\n    conversation as if he had not fought his best, and that he suffered\\n    himself to be thrown on his back in the scuffle, and that he could\\n    wrestle with Mr. Nicolini for what he pleased out of his lion\\'s skin,\\n    it was thought proper to discard him; and it is verily believed to\\n    this day that, had he been brought upon the stage another time, he\\n    would certainly have done mischief. Besides, it was objected against\\n    the first lion that he reared himself so high upon his hinder paws and\\n    walked in so erect a posture that he looked more like an old man than\\n    a lion.\\n\\n    \"The second lion was a tailor by trade, who belonged to the playhouse,\\n    and had the character of a mild and peaceable man in his profession.\\n    If the former was too furious, this was too sheepish for his part,\\n    insomuch that, after a short, modest walk upon the stage, he would\\n    fall at the first touch of Hydaspes, without grappling with him and\\n    giving him an opportunity of showing his variety of Italian trips. It\\n    is said, indeed, that he once gave him a rip in his flesh-coloured\\n    doublet; but this was only to make work for himself in his private\\n    character of a tailor. I must not omit that it was this second lion\\n    who treated me with so much humanity behind the scenes.\\n\\n    \"The acting lion at present is, as I am informed, a country gentleman,\\n    who does it for his diversion, but desires his name may be concealed.\\n    He says, very handsomely in his own excuse, that he does not act for\\n    gain; that he indulges an innocent pleasure in it; and that it is\\n    better to pass away an evening in this manner than in gaming and\\n    drinking; but he says at the same time, with a very agreeable raillery\\n    upon himself, that, if his name were known, the ill-natured world\\n    might call him \\'the ass in the lion\\'s skin.\\' This gentleman\\'s temper\\n    is made out of such a happy mixture of the mild and the choleric that\\n    he outdoes both his predecessors, and has drawn together greater\\n    audiences than have been known in the memory of man.\\n\\n    \"I must not conclude my narrative without taking notice of a\\n    groundless report that has been raised to a gentleman\\'s disadvantage\\n    of whom I must declare myself an admirer; namely, that Signor Nicolini\\n    and the lion have been seen sitting peaceably by one another and\\n    smoking a pipe together behind the scenes; by which their common\\n    enemies would insinuate that it is but a sham combat which they\\n    represent upon the stage; but upon inquiry I find that, if any such\\n    correspondence has passed between them, it was not till the combat was\\n    over, when the lion was to be looked on as dead, according to the\\n    received rules of the drama. Besides, this is what is practised every\\n    day in Westminster Hall, where nothing is more usual than to see a\\n    couple of lawyers who have been tearing each other to pieces in the\\n    court embracing one another as soon as they are out of it.\"[90]\\n\\nIn a somewhat different vein, the ridicule cast by the _Spectator_ on the\\nfashions of his day, by anticipating the judgment of posterity on himself,\\nis equally happy:\\n\\n    \"As for his speculations, notwithstanding the several obsolete words\\n    and obscure phrases of the age in which he lived, we still understand\\n    enough of them to see the diversions and characters of the English\\n    nation in his time; not but that we are to make allowance for the\\n    mirth and humour of the author, who has doubtless strained many\\n    representations of things beyond the truth. For, if we must interpret\\n    his words in their literal meaning, we must suppose that women of the\\n    first quality used to pass away whole mornings at a puppet show; that\\n    they attested their principles by their patches; that an audience\\n    would sit out an evening to hear a dramatical performance written in a\\n    language which they did not understand; that chairs and flowerpots\\n    were introduced as actors upon the British stage; that a promiscuous\\n    assembly of men and women were allowed to meet at midnight in masks\\n    within the verge of the Court; with many improbabilities of the like\\n    nature. We must, therefore, in these and in the like cases, suppose\\n    that these remote hints and allusions aimed at some certain follies\\n    which were then in vogue, and which at present we have not any notion\\n    of.\"[91]\\n\\nHis power of ridiculing keenly without malignity is of course best shown\\nin his character of Sir Roger de Coverley, whose delightful simplicity of\\nmind is made the medium of much good-natured satire on the manners of the\\nTory country gentlemen of the period. One of the most exquisite touches is\\nthe description of the extraordinary conversion of a dissenter by the Act\\nagainst Occasional Conformity.\\n\\n    \"He (Sir Roger) then launched out into praise of the late Act of\\n    Parliament for securing the Church of England, and told me with great\\n    satisfaction that he believed it already began to take effect, for\\n    that a rigid dissenter who chanced to dine in his house on Christmas\\n    day had been observed to eat very plentifully of his\\n    plum-porridge.\"[92]\\n\\nThe mixture of fashionable contempt for book-learning, blended with shrewd\\nmother-wit, is well represented in the character of Will Honeycomb, who\\n\"had the discretion not to go out of his depth, and had often a certain\\nway of making his real ignorance appear a seeming one.\" One of Will\\'s\\nhappiest flights is on the subject of ancient looking-glasses. \"Nay,\" says\\nhe, \"I remember Mr. Dryden in his _Ovid_ tells us of a swinging fellow\\ncalled Polypheme, that made use of the sea for his looking-glass, and\\ncould never dress himself to advantage but in a calm.\"\\n\\nBudgell, Steele, and Addison seem all to have worked on the character of\\nWill Honeycomb, which, however, presents none of the inconsistencies that\\nappear in the portrait of Sir Roger de Coverley. Addison was evidently\\npleased with it, and in his own inimitable ironic manner gave it its\\nfinishing touches by making Will, in his character of a fashionable\\ngallant, write two letters scoffing at wedlock and then marry a farmer\\'s\\ndaughter. The conclusion of the letter in which he announces his fate to\\nthe _Spectator_ is an admirable specimen of Addison\\'s humour:\\n\\n    \"As for your fine women I need not tell thee that I know them. I have\\n    had my share in their graces; but no more of that. It shall be my\\n    business hereafter to live the life of an honest man, and to act as\\n    becomes the master of a family. I question not but I shall draw upon\\n    me the raillery of the town, and be treated to the tune of \"The\\n    Marriage-hater Matched;\" but I am prepared for it. I have been as\\n    witty as others in my time. To tell thee truly, I saw such a tribe of\\n    fashionable young fluttering coxcombs shot up that I do not think my\\n    post of an _homme de ruelle_ any longer tenable. I felt a certain\\n    stiffness in my limbs which entirely destroyed the jauntiness of air I\\n    was once master of. Besides, for I must now confess my age to thee, I\\n    have been eight-and-forty above these twelve years. Since my\\n    retirement into the country will make a vacancy in the Club, I could\\n    wish that you would fill up my place with my friend Tom Dapperwit. He\\n    has an infinite deal of fire, and knows the town. For my own part, as\\n    I have said before, I shall endeavour to live hereafter suitable to a\\n    man in my station, as a prudent head of a family, a good husband, a\\n    careful father (when it shall so happen), and as\\n\\n      \"Your most sincere friend and humble servant,\\n        \"WILLIAM HONEYCOMB.\"[93]\\n\\nI have already alluded to the delight with which the fancy of Addison\\nplayed round the caprices of female attire. The following--an extract from\\nthe paper on the \"fair sex\" which specially roused the spleen of Swift--is\\na good specimen of his style when in this vein:\\n\\n    \"To return to our female heads. The ladies have been for some time in\\n    a kind of moulting season with regard to that part of their dress,\\n    having cast great quantities of ribbon, lace, and cambric, and in some\\n    measure reduced that part of the human figure to the beautiful\\n    globular form which is natural to it. We have for a great while\\n    expected what kind of ornament would be substituted in the place of\\n    those antiquated commodes. But our female projectors were all the last\\n    summer so taken up with the improvement of their petticoats that they\\n    had not time to attend to anything else; but having at length\\n    sufficiently adorned their lower parts, they now begin to turn their\\n    thoughts upon the other extremity, as well remembering the old kitchen\\n    proverb, \\'that if you light your fire at both ends, the middle will\\n    shift for itself.\\'\"[94]\\n\\nAddison may be said to have almost created and wholly perfected English\\nprose as an instrument for the expression of _social_ thought. Prose had\\nof course been written in many different manners before his time. Bacon,\\nCowley, and Temple had composed essays; Hooker, Sir Thomas Browne, Hobbes,\\nand Locke philosophical treatises; Milton controversial pamphlets; Dryden\\ncritical prefaces; Raleigh and Clarendon histories; Taylor, Barrow, South,\\nand Tillotson sermons. But it cannot be said that any of these had founded\\na prose style which, besides being a reflection of the mind of the writer,\\ncould be taken as representing the genius and character of the nation.\\nThey write as if they were thinking apart from their audience, or as if\\nthey were speaking to it either from an inferior or superior position. The\\nessayists had taken as their model Montaigne, and their style is therefore\\nstamped, so to speak, with the character of soliloquy; the preachers, who\\nperhaps did more than any writers to guide the genius of the language,\\nnaturally addressed their hearers with the authority of their office;\\nMilton, even in controversy, rises from the natural sublimity of his mind\\nto heights of eloquence to which the ordinary idioms of society could not\\nhave borne him; while Dryden, using the language with a raciness and\\nrhythm probably unequalled in our literature, nevertheless exhibits in his\\nprefaces an air of deference towards the various patrons he addresses.\\nMoreover, many of the earlier prose writers had aimed at standards of\\ndiction which were inconsistent with the genius of the English tongue.\\nBacon, for instance, disfigures his style with the witty antitheses which\\nfound favour with the Elizabethan and early Stuart writers; Hooker,\\nMilton, and Browne construct their sentences on a Latin model, which,\\nthough it often gives a certain dignity of manner, prevents anything like\\nease, simplicity, and lucidity of expression. Thus Hooker delights in\\ninversions; both he and Milton protract their periods by the insertion of\\nmany subordinate clauses; and Browne \"projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia\\nverba\" till the Saxon element seems almost eliminated from his style.\\n\\nAddison took features of his style from almost all his predecessors: he\\nassumes the characters of essayist, moralist, philosopher, and critic, but\\nhe blends them all together in his new capacity of journalist. He had\\naccepted the public as his judges; and he writes as if some critical\\nrepresentative of the public were at his elbow, putting to the test of\\nreason every sentiment and every expression. Warton tells us, in his\\n_Essay on Pope_, that Addison was so fastidious in composition that he\\nwould often stop the press to alter a preposition or conjunction; and this\\nevidence is corroborated in a very curious and interesting manner by the\\nMS. of some of Addison\\'s essays, discovered by Mr. Dykes Campbell in\\n1858.[95] A sentence in one of the papers on the _Pleasures of the\\nImagination_ shows, by the various stages through which it passed before\\nits form seemed satisfactory to the writer, what nice attention he gave to\\nthe balance, rhythm, and lucidity of his periods. In its original shape\\nthe sentence was written thus:\\n\\n    \"For this reason we find the poets always crying up a Country Life;\\n    where Nature is left to herself, and appears to y{e} best advantage.\"\\n\\nThis is rather bald, and the MS. is accordingly corrected as follows:\\n\\n    \"For this reason we find all Fancifull men, and y{e} poets in\\n    particular, still in love with a Country Life; where Nature is left to\\n    herself, and furnishes out all y{e} variety of Scenes y{t} are most\\n    delightful to y{e} Imagination.\"\\n\\nThe text as it stands is this:\\n\\n    \"For this reason we always find the poet in love with a country life,\\n    where nature appears in the greatest perfection, and furnishes out all\\n    those scenes that are most apt to delight the imagination.\"[96]\\n\\nThis is certainly the best, both in point of sense and sound. Addison\\nperceived that there was a certain contradiction in the idea of Nature\\nbeing \"left to herself,\" and at the same time _furnishing_ scenes for the\\npleasure of the imagination; he therefore imparted the notion of design by\\nstriking out the former phrase and substituting \"seen in perfection;\" and\\nhe emphasised the idea by afterwards changing \"delightful\" into the\\nstronger phrase \"apt to delight.\" The improvement of the rhythm of the\\nsentence in its final form is obvious.\\n\\nWith so much elaboration of style it is natural that there should be in\\nAddison\\'s essays a disappearance of that egotism which is a\\ncharacteristic--and a charming one--of Montaigne; his moralising is\\nnatural, for the age required it, but is free from the censoriousness of\\nthe preacher; his critical and philosophical papers all assume an\\nintelligence in his reader equal to his own.\\n\\nThis perfection of breeding in writing is an art which vanishes with the\\n_Tatler_ and _Spectator_. Other critics, other humourists have made their\\nmark in English literature, but no second Addison has appeared. Johnson\\ntook him for his model so far as to convey lessons of morality to the\\npublic by means of periodical essays. But he confesses that he addressed\\nhis audience in tones of \"dictatorial instruction;\" and any one who\\ncompares the ponderous sententiousness and the elaborate antithesis of the\\n_Rambler_ with the light and rhythmical periods of the _Spectator_ will\\nperceive that the spirit of preaching is gaining ground on the genius of\\nconversation. Charles Lamb, again, has passages which, for mere delicacy\\nof humour, are equal to anything in Addison\\'s writings. But the\\nsuperiority of Addison consists in this, that he expresses the humour of\\nthe life about him, while Lamb is driven to look at its oddities from\\noutside. He is not, like Addison, a moralist or a satirist; the latter\\nindeed performed his task so thoroughly that the turbulent license of\\nMohocks, Tityre Tus, and such like brotherhoods, gradually disappeared\\nbefore the advance of a tame and orderly public opinion. To Lamb, looking\\nback on the primitive stages of society from a safe distance, vice itself\\nseemed pardonable because picturesque, much in the same way as travellers\\nbegan to admire the loneliness and the grandeur of nature when they were\\nrelieved from apprehensions for the safety of their purses and their\\nnecks. His humour is that of a sentimentalist; it dwells on odd nooks and\\ncorners, and describes quaint survivals in men and things. For our own\\nage, when all that is picturesque in society is being levelled by a dull\\nutilitarianism, this vein of eccentric imagination has a special charm,\\nbut the taste is likely to be a transient one. Mrs. Battle will amuse so\\nlong as this generation remembers the ways of its grandmothers: two\\ngenerations hence the point of its humour will probably be lost. But the\\nfigure of Sir Roger de Coverley, though it belongs to a bygone stage of\\nsociety, is as durable as human nature itself, and, while the language\\nlasts, the exquisite beauty of the colours in which it is preserved will\\nexcite the same kind of pleasure. Scarcely below the portrait of the good\\nknight will be ranked the character of his friend and biographer, the\\nsilent Spectator of men. A grateful posterity, remembering what it owes to\\nhim, will continue to assign him the reputation he coveted: \"It was said\\nof Socrates that he brought Philosophy down from heaven to inhabit among\\nmen; and I shall be ambitious to have it said of me that I have brought\\nPhilosophy out of closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell at\\nclubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and in coffee-houses.\"\\n\\n\\nTHE END.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n[1] _Spectator_, No. 108.\\n\\n[2] _Spectator_, No. 158.\\n\\n[3] _Spectator_, No. 341.\\n\\n[4] _Spectator_, No. 65.\\n\\n[5] _Tatler_, No. 25.\\n\\n[6] A note in the edition of Johnson\\'s _Lives of the Poets_, published in\\n1801, states, on the authority of a \"Lady in Wiltshire,\" who derived her\\ninformation from a Mr. Stephens, a Fellow of Magdalen and a contemporary\\nof Addison\\'s, that the Henry Sacheverell to whom Addison dedicated his\\n_Account of the Greatest English Poets_ was not the well-known divine, but\\na personal friend of Addison\\'s, who died young, having written a _History\\nof the Isle of Man_.\\n\\n[7] _Spence\\'s Anecdotes_, p. 50.\\n\\n[8] Compare the _Notes on the Metamorphoses_, Fab. v.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n'"

In his _Journal to Stella_, his social', 'verses, and his letters to his friends, we have a vivid picture of those', 'relations with women and that protracted suffering which invest with such', 'tragic interest the history of Swift. Pope, by the publication of his own', 'correspondence, has enabled us, in a way that he never intended, to', 'understand the strange moral twist which distorted a nature by no means', 'devoid of noble instincts. Johnson was fortunate in the companionship of', 'perhaps the best biographer who ever lived. But of the real life and', 'character of Addison scarcely any contemporary record remains. The formal', \"narrative prefixed to his works by Tickell is, by that writer's own\", 'admission, little more than a bibliography. Steele, who might have told us', 'more than any man about his boyhood and his manner of life in London, had', 'become estranged from his old friend before his death. No writer has', 'taken the trouble to preserve any account of the wit and wisdom that', 'enlivened the \"little senate\" at Button\\'s. His own letters are, as a rule,', 'compositions as finished as his papers in the _Spectator_. Those features', 'in his character which excite the greatest interest have been delineated', 'by the hand of an enemy--an enemy who possessed an unrivalled power of', 'satirical portrait-painting, and was restrained by no regard for truth', 'from creating in the public mind such impressions about others as might', 'serve to heighten the favourable opinion of himself.', '', \"This absence of dramatic incident in Addison's life would lead us\", 'naturally to conclude that he was deficient in the energy and passion', 'which cause a powerful nature to leave a mark upon its age. Yet such a', 'judgment would certainly be erroneous. Shy and reserved as he was, the', 'unanimous verdict of his most illustrious contemporaries is decisive as to', 'the respect and admiration which he excited among them. The man who could', 'exert so potent an influence over the mercurial Steele, who could', 'fascinate the haughty and cynical intellect of Swift, whose conversation,', 'by the admission of his satirist Pope, had in it something more charming', 'than that of any other man; of whom it was said that he might have been', 'chosen king if he wished it; such a man, though to the coarse perception', 'of Mandeville he might have seemed no more than \"a parson in a tye-wig,\"', 'can hardly have been deficient in force of character.', '', 'Nor would it have been possible for a writer distinguished by mere', 'elegance and refinement to leave a lasting impress on the literature and', 'society of his country. In one generation after another, men representing', 'opposing elements of rank, class, interest, and taste, have agreed in', 'acknowledging Addison\\'s extraordinary merits. \"Whoever wishes,\" says', 'Johnson--at the end of a biography strongly coloured with the', 'prepossessions of a semi-Jacobite Tory--\"whoever wishes to attain an', 'English style, familiar but not coarse, and elegant but not ostentatious,', 'must give his days and nights to the volumes of Addison.\" \"Such a mark of', 'national respect,\" says Macaulay, the best representative of middle-class', 'opinion in the present century, speaking of the statue erected to Addison', 'in Westminster Abbey, \"was due to the unsullied statesman, to the', 'accomplished scholar, to the master of pure English eloquence, to the', 'consummate painter of life and manners. It was due, above all, to the', 'great satirist who alone knew how to use ridicule without abusing it; who,', 'without inflicting a wound, effected a great social reform, and who', 'reconciled wit and virtue after a long and disastrous separation, during', 'which wit had been led astray by profligacy, and virtue by fanaticism.\"', '', 'This verdict of a great critic is accepted by an age to which the grounds', 'of it are, perhaps, not very apparent. The author of any ideal creation--a', 'poem, a drama, or a novel--has an imprescriptible property in the fame of', 'his work. But to harmonise conflicting social elements, to bring order out', 'of chaos in the sphere of criticism, to form right ways of thinking about', 'questions of morals, taste, and breeding, are operations of which the', 'credit, though it is certainly to be ascribed to particular individuals,', \"is generally absorbed by society itself. Macaulay's eulogy is as just as\", 'it is eloquent, but the pages of the _Spectator_ alone will hardly show', 'the reader why Addison should be so highly praised for having reconciled', 'wit with virtue. Nor, looking at him as a critic, will it appear a great', 'achievement to have pointed out to English society the beauties of', '_Paradise Lost_, unless it be remembered that the taste of the preceding', \"generation still influenced Addison's contemporaries, and that in that\", 'generation Cowley was accounted a greater poet than Milton.', '', 'To estimate Addison at his real value we must regard him as the chief', 'architect of Public Opinion in the eighteenth century. But here again we', 'are met by an initial difficulty, because it has become almost a', 'commonplace of contemporary criticism to represent the eighteenth century', 'as a period of sheer destruction. It is tacitly assumed by a school of', 'distinguished philosophical writers that we have arrived at a stage in the', \"world's history in which it is possible to take a positive and scientific\", 'view of human affairs. As it is of course necessary that from such a', 'system all belief in the supernatural shall be jealously excluded, it has', 'not seemed impossible to write the history of Thought itself in the', 'eighteenth century. And in tracing the course of this supposed continuous', 'stream it is natural that all the great English writers of the period', 'should be described as in one way or another helping to pull down, or', 'vainly to strengthen, the theological barriers erected by centuries of', 'bigotry against the irresistible tide of enlightened progress.', '', 'It would be of course entirely out of place to discuss here the merits of', 'this new school of history. Those who consider that, whatever glimpses we', 'may obtain of the law and order of the universe, man is, as he always has', 'been and always will be, a mystery to himself, will hardly allow that the', 'operations of the human spirit can be traced in the dissecting-room. But', 'it is, in any case, obvious that to treat the great _imaginative_ writers', 'of any age as if they were only mechanical agents in an evolution of', 'thought is to do them grave injustice. Such writers are, above all things,', 'creative. Their first aim is to \"show the very age and body of the time', 'his form and pressure.\" No work of the eighteenth century, composed in a', 'consciously destructive spirit, has taken its place among the acknowledged', 'classics of the language. Even the _Tale of a Tub_ is to be regarded as a', 'satire upon the aberrations of theologians from right reason, not upon the', 'principles of Christianity itself. The _Essay on Man_ has, no doubt,', 'logically a tendency towards Deism, but nobody ever read the poem for the', 'sake of its philosophy; and it is well known that Pope was much alarmed', 'when it was pointed out to him that his conclusions might be represented', 'as incompatible with the doctrines of revealed religion.', '', 'The truth indeed seems to be the exact converse of what is alleged by the', 'scientific historians. So far from the eighteenth century in England being', 'an age of destructive analysis, its energies were chiefly devoted to', 'political, social, and literary reconstruction. Whatever revolution in', 'faith and manners the English nation had undergone had been the work of', 'the two preceding centuries, and though the historic foundations of', 'society remained untouched, the whole form of the superstructure had been', 'profoundly modified.', '', '    \"So tenacious are we,\" said Burke, towards the close of the last', '    century, \"of our old ecclesiastical modes and fashions of institution', '    that very little change has been made in them since the fourteenth or', '    fifteenth centuries, adhering in this particular as in all else to our', '    old settled maxim never entirely nor at once to depart from antiquity.', '    We found these institutions on the whole favourable to morality and', '    discipline, and we thought they were susceptible of amendment without', '    altering the ground. We thought they were capable of receiving and', '    meliorating, and, above all, of preserving the accessories of science', '    and literature as the order of Providence should successively produce', '    them. And after all, with this Gothic and monkish education (for such', '    it is the groundwork), we may put in our claim to as ample and early', '    a share in all the improvements in science, in arts, and in literature', '    which have illuminated the modern world as any other nation in Europe.', '    We think one main cause of this improvement was our not despising the', '    patrimony of knowledge which was left us by our forefathers.\"', '', 'All this is, in substance, true of our political as well as our', 'ecclesiastical institutions. And yet, when Burke wrote, the great feudal', 'and mediæval structure of England had been so transformed by the Wars of', 'the Roses, the Reformation, the Rebellion, and the Revolution, that its', 'ancient outlines were barely visible. In so far, therefore, as his words', 'seem to imply that the social evolution he describes was produced by an', 'imperceptible and almost mechanical process of national instinct, the', 'impression they tend to create is entirely erroneous.', '', 'If we have been hitherto saved from such corruption as undermined the', 'republics of Italy, from the religious wars that so long enfeebled and', 'divided Germany, and from the Revolution that has severed modern France', 'from her ancient history, thanks for this are due partly, no doubt, to', 'favouring conditions of nature and society, but quite as much to the', 'genius of great individuals who prepared the mind of the nation for the', 'gradual assimilation of new ideas. Thus Langland and Wycliffe and their', 'numerous followers, long before the Reformation, had so familiarised the', 'minds of the people with their ideas of the Christian religion that the', 'Sovereign was able to assume the Headship of the Church without the shock', 'of a social convulsion. Fresh feelings and instincts grew up in the hearts', 'of whole classes of the nation without at first producing any change in', 'outward habits of life, and even without arousing a sense of their logical', 'incongruity. These mixed ideas were constantly brought before the', 'imagination in the works of the poets. Shakespeare abounds with passages', 'in which, side by side with the old feudal, monarchical, catholic, and', 'patriotic instincts of Englishmen, we find the sentiments of the Italian', 'Renaissance. Spenser conveys Puritan doctrines sometimes by the mouth of', 'shepherds, whose originals he had found in Theocritus and Virgil;', 'sometimes under allegorical forms derived from books of chivalry and the', 'ceremonial of the Catholic Church. Milton, the most rigidly Calvinistic of', 'all the English poets in his opinions, is also the most severely classical', 'in his style.', '', 'It was the task of Addison to carry on the reconciling traditions of our', 'literature. It is his praise to have accomplished his task under', 'conditions far more difficult than any that his predecessors had', 'experienced. What they had done was to give instinctive and characteristic', 'expression to the floating ideas of the society about them; what Addison', 'and his contemporaries did was to found a public opinion by a conscious', 'effort of reason and persuasion. Before the Civil Wars there had been at', 'least no visible breach in the principle of Authority in Church and State.', 'At the beginning of the eighteenth century constituted authority had been', 'recently overthrown; one king had been beheaded, another had been', 'expelled; the Episcopalian form of Church Government had been violently', 'displaced in favour of the Presbyterian, and had been with almost equal', 'violence restored. Whole classes of the population had been drawn into', 'opposing camps during the Civil War, and still stood confronting each', 'other with all the harsh antagonism of sentiment inherited from that', 'conflict. Such a bare summary alone is sufficient to indicate the nature', 'of the difficulties Addison had to encounter in his efforts to harmonise', 'public opinion; but a more detailed examination of the state of society', 'after the Restoration is required to place in its full light the', 'extraordinary merits of the success that he achieved.', '', 'There was, to begin with, a vehement opposition between town and country.', 'In the country the old ideas of Feudalism, modified by circumstances, but', 'vigorous and deep-rooted, still prevailed. True, the military system of', 'land-tenure had disappeared with the Restoration, but it was not so with', 'the relations of life, and the habits of thought and feeling which the', 'system had created. The features of surviving Feudalism have been', 'inimitably preserved for us in the character of Sir Roger de Coverley.', 'Living in the patriarchal fashion, in the midst of tenants and retainers,', 'who looked up to him as their chief, and for whose welfare and protection', 'he considered himself responsible, the country gentleman valued above all', 'things the principle of Loyalty. To the moneyed classes in the towns he', 'was instinctively opposed; he regarded their interests, both social and', 'commercial, as contrary to his own; he looked with dislike and suspicion', 'on the economical principles of government and conduct on which these', 'classes naturally rely. Even the younger sons of county families had in', \"Addison's day abandoned the custom, common enough in the feudal times, of\", 'seeking their fortune in trade. Many a Will Wimble now spent his whole', 'life in the country, training dogs for his neighbours, fishing their', 'streams, making whips for their young heirs, and even garters for their', 'wives and daughters.[1]', '', 'The country gentlemen were confirmed in these ideas by the difficulties of', 'communication. During his visit to Sir Roger de Coverley the _Spectator_', 'observed the extreme slowness with which fashions penetrated into the', 'country; and he noticed, too, that party spirit was much more violent', 'there than in the towns. The learning of the clergy, many of whom resided', 'with the country squires as chaplains, was of course enlisted on the Tory', 'side, and supplied it with arguments which the body of the party might', 'perhaps have found it difficult to discover, or at least to express, for', 'themselves. For Tory tastes undoubtedly lay generally rather in the', 'direction of sport than of books. Sir Roger seems to be as much above the', 'average level of his class as Squire Western is certainly below it:', 'perhaps the Tory fox-hunter of the _Freeholder_, though somewhat', 'satirically painted, is a fair representative of the society which had its', 'headquarters at the October Club, and whose favourite poet was Tom', \"D'Urfey.\", '', 'The commercial and professional classes, from whom the Whigs derived their', 'chief support, of course predominated in the towns, and their larger', 'opportunities of association gave them an influence in affairs which', 'compensated for their inferiority in numbers. They lacked, however, what', 'the country party possessed, a generous ideal of life. Though many of them', 'were connected with the Presbyterian system, their common sense made them', 'revolt from its rigidity, while at the same time their economical', 'principles failed to supply them with any standard that could satisfy the', 'imagination. Sir Andrew Freeport excites in us less interest than any', \"member of the Spectator's Club. There was not yet constituted among the\", 'upper middle classes that mixed conception of good feeling, good breeding,', 'and good taste which we now attach to the name of \"gentleman.\"', '', 'Two main currents of opinion divided the country, to one of which a man', 'was obliged to surrender himself if he wished to enjoy the pleasures of', 'organised society. One of these was Puritanism, but this was undoubtedly', 'the less popular, or at least the less fashionable. A protracted', 'experience of Roundhead tyranny under the Long Parliament had inclined the', 'nation to believe that almost any form of Government was preferable to', 'that of the Saints. The Puritan, no longer the mere sectarian, as in the', 'days of Elizabeth and James I., somewhat ridiculous in the extravagance of', 'his opinions, but respectable from the constancy with which he maintained', 'them, had ruled over them as a taskmaster, and had forced them, as far as', 'he could by military violence, to practise the asceticism to which monks', 'and nuns had voluntarily submitted themselves. The most innocent as well', 'as the most brutal diversions of the people were sacrificed to his', 'spiritual pride. As Macaulay well says, he hated bear-baiting, not because', 'it gave pain to the bear, but because it gave pleasure to the spectator.', 'The tendency of his creed was, in fact, anti-social. Beauty in his eyes', 'was a snare, and pleasure a sin; the only mode of social intercourse which', 'he approved was a sermon.', '', 'On the other hand, the habits of the Court, which gave the tone to all', 'polite society, were almost equally distasteful to the instincts of the', 'people. It was inevitable that the inclinations of Charles II. should be', 'violently opposed to every sentiment of the Puritans. While he was in the', 'power of the Scots he had been forced into feigned compliance with', 'Presbyterian rites; the Puritans had put his father to death, and had', 'condemned himself to many years of exile and hardship in Catholic', 'countries. He had returned to his own land half French in his political', 'and religious sympathies, and entirely so in his literary tastes. To', 'convert and to corrupt those of his subjects who immediately surrounded', 'him was an easy matter. \"All by the king\\'s example lived and loved.\"', 'Poets, painters, and actors were forward to promote principles viewed', 'with favour by their sovereign and not at all disagreeable to themselves.', 'An ingenious philosopher elevated Absolutism into an intellectual and', 'moral system, the consequence of which was to encourage the powerful in', 'the indulgence of every selfish instinct. As the Puritans had oppressed', 'the country with a system of inhuman religion and transcendental morality,', 'so now, in order to get as far from Puritanism as possible, it seemed', 'necessary for every one aspiring to be thought a gentleman to avow himself', 'an atheist or a debauchee.', '', 'The ideas of the man in the mode after the Restoration are excellently hit', 'off in one of the fictitious letters in the _Spectator_:', '', '    \"I am now between fifty and sixty, and had the honour to be well with', '    the first men of taste and gallantry in the joyous reign of Charles', '    the Second.

His boldness was not', 'agreeable to the University authorities, and being forced to leave Oxford,', 'he maintained himself for a time near Petworth, in Sussex, by acting as', 'chaplain or tutor in families attached to the Royalist cause. After the', 'Restoration he obtained the appointment of chaplain to the garrison of', 'Dunkirk, and when that town was ceded to France in 1662, he was removed in', 'a similar capacity to Tangier. Here he remained eight years, but,', 'venturing on a visit to England, his post was bestowed upon another, and', 'he would have been left without resources had not one of his friends', 'presented him with the living of Milston, valued at £120 a year. With the', 'courage of his order he thereupon took a wife, Jane, daughter of Dr.', 'Nathaniel Gulston, and sister of William Gulston, Bishop of Bristol, by', 'whom he had six children, three sons and three daughters, all born at', 'Milston. In 1675 he was made a prebendary of Salisbury Cathedral and', 'Chaplain-in-Ordinary to the King; and in 1683 he was promoted to the', 'Deanery of Lichfield, as a reward for his services at Tangier, and out of', 'consideration of losses which he had sustained by a fire at Milston. His', 'literary reputation stood high, and it is said that he would have been', 'made a bishop, if his old zeal for legitimacy had not prompted him to', 'manifest in the Convocation of 1689 his hostility to the Revolution. He', 'died in 1703.', '', 'Lancelot was a writer at once voluminous and lively. In the latter part of', 'his life he produced several treatises on theological subjects, the most', 'popular of which was called _An Introduction to the Sacrament_. This book', 'passed through many editions. The doctrine it contains leans rather to the', 'Low Church side. But much the most characteristic of his writings were his', 'works on Mahommedanism and Judaism, the results of his studies during his', 'residence in Barbary. These show not only considerable industry and', 'research and powers of shrewd observation, but that genuine literary', 'faculty which enables a writer to leave upon a subject of a general nature', 'the impression of his own character. While there is nothing forced or', 'exaggerated in his historical style, a vein of allegory runs through the', 'narrative of the _Revolutions of the Kingdoms of Fez and Morocco_, which', 'must have had a piquant flavour for the orthodox English reader of that', 'day. Recollections of the Protectorate would have taken nothing of its', 'vividness from the portrait of the Moorish priest who \"began to grow into', 'reputation with the people by reason of his high pretensions to piety and', 'fervent zeal for their law, illustrated by a stubborn rigidity of', 'conversation and outward sanctity of life.\" When the Zeriffe, with', 'ambitious designs on the throne, sent his sons on a pilgrimage to Mecca,', 'the religious buffooneries practised by the young men must have recalled', 'to the reader circumstances more recent and personal than those which the', 'author was apparently describing. \"Much was the reverence and reputation', 'of holiness which they thereby acquired among the superstitious people,', 'who could hardly be kept from kissing their garments and adoring them as', 'saints, while they failed not in their parts, but acted as much devotion', 'as high contemplative looks, deep sighs, tragical gestures, and other', \"passionate interjections of holiness could express. 'Allah, allah!' was\", 'their doleful note, their sustenance the people\\'s alms.\" And when these', 'impostors had inveigled the King of Fez into a religious war, the', 'description of those who \"mistrusted their own safety, and began, but too', 'late, to repent their approving of an armed hypocrisy,\" was not more', 'applicable to the rulers of Barbary than to the people of England. \"Puffed', 'up with their successes, they forgot their obedience, and these saints', 'denied the king the fifth part of their spoils.... By which it appeared', 'that they took up arms, not out of love for their country and zeal for', 'their religion, but out of desire of rule.\" There is, indeed, nothing in', 'these utterances which need have prevented the writer from consistently', 'promoting the Revolution of 1688; yet his principles seem to have carried', 'him far in the opposite direction; and it is interesting to remember that', 'the assertor in Convocation of the doctrine of indefeasible hereditary', 'right was the father of the author of the _Whig Examiner_ and the', '_Freeholder_. However decidedly Joseph may have dissented from his', \"father's political creed, we know that he entertained admiration and\", 'respect for his memory, and that death alone prevented him from', \"completing the monument afterwards erected in Lancelot's honour in\", 'Lichfield Cathedral.', '', \"Of Addison's mother nothing of importance is recorded. His second brother,\", 'Gulston, became Governor of Fort St. George, in the East Indies; and the', \"third, Lancelot, followed in Joseph's footsteps so far as to obtain a\", 'Fellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford. His sisters, Jane and Anna, died', 'young; but Dorothy was twice married, and Swift records in her honour that', 'she was \"a kind of wit, and very like her brother.\" We may readily believe', 'that a writer so lively as Lancelot would have had clever children, but', 'Steele was perhaps carried away by the zeal of friendship or the love of', 'epigram when he said, in his dedication to the _Drummer_: \"Mr. Dean', 'Addison left behind him four children, each of whom, for excellent talents', 'and singular perfections, was as much above the ordinary world as their', 'brother Joseph was above them.\" But that Steele had a sincere admiration', 'for the whole family is sufficiently shown by his using them as an example', 'in one of his early _Tatlers_:', '', '    \"I remember among all my acquaintance but one man whom I have thought', '    to live with his children with equanimity and a good grace.

I have often heard him say he had the', '    weakness to love one much better than the other, but that he took as', '    much pains to correct that as any other criminal passion that could', '    arise in his mind. His method was to make it the only pretension in', '    his children to his favour to be kind to each other, and he would tell', '    them that he who was the best brother he would reckon the best son.', '    This turned their thoughts into an emulation for the superiority in', '    kind and tender affection towards each other. The boys behaved', '    themselves very early with a manly friendship; and their sister,', '    instead of the gross familiarities and impertinent freedoms in', '    behaviour usual in other houses, was always treated by them with as', '    much complaisance as any other young lady of their acquaintance. It', '    was an unspeakable pleasure to visit or sit at a meal in that family.', \"    I have often seen the old man's heart flow at his eyes with joy upon\", '    occasions which would appear indifferent to such as were strangers to', '    the turn of his mind; but a very slight accident, wherein he saw his', \"    children's good-will to one another, created in him the god-like\", '    pleasure of loving them because they loved each other. This great', '    command of himself in hiding his first impulse to partiality at last', '    improved to a steady justice towards them, and that which at first was', '    but an expedient to correct his weakness was afterwards the measure of', '    his virtue.\"[5]', '', 'This, no doubt, is the set description of a moralist, and to an age in', 'which the liberty of manners has grown into something like license it may', 'savour of formalism and priggishness; but when we remember that the writer', 'was one of the most warm-hearted of men, and that the subject of his', 'panegyric was himself, full of vivacity and impulse, it must be admitted', 'that the picture which it gives us of the Addison family in the rectory of', 'Milston is a particularly amiable one.', '', 'Though the eighteenth century had little of that feeling for natural', \"beauty which distinguishes our own, a man of Addison's imagination could\", 'hardly fail to be impressed by the character of the scenery in which his', \"childhood was passed. No one who has travelled on a summer's day across\", 'Salisbury plain, with its vast canopy of sky and its open tracts of', 'undulating downland, relieved by no shadows except such as are thrown by', 'the passing cloud, the grazing sheep, and the great circle of Stonehenge,', 'will forget the delightful sense of refreshment and repose produced by the', 'descent into the valley of the Avon. The sounds of human life rising from', 'the villages after the long solitude of the plain, the shade of the deep', 'woods, the coolness of the river, like all streams rising in the chalk,', 'clear and peaceful, are equally delicious to the sense and the', 'imagination.

He was removed from Amesbury to Salisbury,', 'and thence to the Grammar School at Lichfield, where he is said to have', 'been the leader in a \"barring out.\" From Lichfield he passed to the', 'Charter House, then under the charge of Dr. Ellis, a man of taste and', 'scholarship. The Charter House at that period was, after Westminster, the', 'best-known school in England, and here was laid the foundation of that', 'sound classical taste which perfected the style of the essays in the', '_Spectator_.', '', \"Macaulay labours with much force and ingenuity to prove that Addison's\", 'classical acquirements were only superficial, and, in his usual', 'epigrammatic manner, hazards the opinion that \"his knowledge of Greek,', 'though doubtless such as was, in his time, thought respectable at Oxford,', 'was evidently less than that which many lads now carry away every year', 'from Eton and Rugby.\" That Addison was not a scholar of the class of', 'Bentley or Porson may be readily admitted. But many scattered allusions in', 'his works prove that his acquaintance with the Greek poets of every', 'period, if cursory, was wide and intelligent: he was sufficiently master', 'of the language thoroughly to understand the spirit of what he read; he', 'undertook while at Oxford a translation of Herodotus, and one of the', \"papers in the _Spectator_ is a direct imitation of a _jeu d'esprit_ of\", \"Lucian's. The Eton or Rugby boy who, in these days, with a normal appetite\", 'for cricket and football, acquired an equal knowledge of Greek literature,', 'would certainly be somewhat of a prodigy.', '', \"No doubt, however, Addison's knowledge of the Latin poets was, as Macaulay\", 'infers, far more extensive and profound. It would have been strange had it', 'been otherwise. The influence of the classical side of the Italian', 'Renaissance was now at its height, and wherever those ideas became', 'paramount Latin composition was held in at least as much esteem as poetry', 'in the vernacular. Especially was this the case in England, where certain', 'affinities of character and temperament made it easy for writers to adopt', 'Roman habits of thought. Latin verse composition soon took firm root in', 'the public schools and universities, so that clever boys of the period', 'were tolerably familiar with most of the minor Roman poets. Pope, in the', 'Fourth Book of the _Dunciad_, vehemently attacked the tradition as', 'confining the mind to the study of words rather than of things; but he had', 'himself had no experience of a public school, and only those who fail to', 'appreciate the influence of Latin verse composition on the style of our', 'own greatest orators, and of poets like Milton and Gray, will be inclined', 'to undervalue it as an instrument of social and literary training.', '', 'Proficiency in this art may at least be said to have laid the foundation', \"of Addison's fortunes. Leaving the Charter House in 1687, at the early age\", \"of fifteen, he was entered at Queen's College, Oxford, and remained a\", 'member of that society for two years, when a copy of his Latin verses fell', 'into the hands of Dr. Lancaster, then Fellow and afterwards Provost of the', 'College. Struck with their excellence, Lancaster used his influence to', 'obtain for him a demyship at Magdalen. The subject of this fortunate set', 'of verses was \"Inauguratio Regis Gulielmi,\" from which fact we may', 'reasonably infer that even in his boyhood his mind had acquired a Whig', 'bias. Whatever inclination he may have had in this direction would have', 'been confirmed by the associations of his new college. The fluctuations of', 'opinion in Magdalen had been frequent and extraordinary. Towards the close', \"of Elizabeth's reign it was notorious for its Calvinism, but under the\", 'Chancellorship of Laud it appears to have adopted, with equal ardour, the', 'cause of Arminianism, for it was among the colleges that offered the', 'stoutest opposition to the Puritan visitors in 1647-48. The despotic', 'tendencies of James II., however, again cooled its loyalty, and its', \"spirited resistance to the king's order for the election of a Roman\", 'Catholic President had given a mortal blow to the Stuart dynasty. Hough', 'was now President, but in consequence of the dispute with the king there', 'had been no election of demies in 1688, so that twice the usual number was', 'chosen in the following year, and the occasion was distinguished by the', 'name of the \"golden election.\" From Magdalen Addison proceeded to his', \"master's degree in 1693; the College elected him probationary Fellow in\", '1697, and actual Fellow the year after. He retained his Fellowship till', '1711.', '', 'Of his tastes, habits, and friendships at Oxford there are few records.', 'Among his acquaintance were Boulter, afterwards Archbishop of', 'Dublin--whose memory is unenviably perpetuated, in company with Ambrose', \"Phillips, in Pope's _Epistle to Arbuthnot_,\", '', '  \"Does not one table Bavius still admit,', '  Still to one Bishop Phillips seem a wit?\"--', '', 'and possibly the famous Sacheverell.[6] He is said to have shown in the', 'society of Magdalen some of the shyness that afterwards distinguished him;', 'he kept late hours, and read chiefly after dinner. The walk under the', 'well-known elms by the Cherwell is still connected with his name. Though', 'he probably acted as tutor in the college, the greater part of his quiet', 'life at the University was doubtless occupied in study. A proof of his', 'early maturity is seen in the fact that, in his nineteenth year, a young', 'man of birth and fortune, Mr. Rushout, who was being educated at Magdalen,', 'was placed under his charge.', '', 'His reputation as a scholar and a man of taste soon extended itself to the', 'world of letters in London. In 1693, being then in his twenty-second year,', 'he wrote his _Account of the Greatest English Poets_; and about the same', 'time he addressed a short copy of verses to Dryden, complimenting him on', 'the enduring vigour of his poetical faculty, as shown in his translations', 'of Virgil and other Latin poets, some of which had recently appeared in', \"Tonson's _Miscellany_. The old poet appears to have been highly gratified,\", 'and to have welcomed the advances thus made to him, for he returned', \"Addison's compliment by bestowing high and not unmerited praise on the\", 'translation of the Fourth Book of the _Georgics_, which the latter soon', 'after undertook, and by printing, as a preface to his own translation, a', 'discourse written by Addison on the _Georgics_, as well as arguments to', 'most of the books of the _Æneid_.', '', 'Through Dryden, no doubt, he became acquainted with Jacob Tonson.

Observing how strongly', 'the public taste set towards the great classical writers, he was anxious', 'to employ men of ability in the work of turning them into English; and it', 'appears from existing correspondence that he engaged Addison, while the', 'latter was at Oxford, to superintend a translation of Herodotus. He also', 'suggested a translation of Ovid. Addison undertook to procure coadjutors', 'for the work of translating the Greek historian. He himself actually', 'translated the books called _Polymnia_ and _Urania_, but for some', 'unexplained reason the work was never published. For Ovid he seems, on the', \"whole, to have had less inclination. At Tonson's instance he translated\", 'the Second Book of the _Metamorphoses_, which was first printed in the', 'volume of _Miscellanies_ that appeared in 1697; but he wrote to the', 'publisher that \"Ovid had so many silly stories with his good ones that he', 'was more tedious to translate than a better poet would be.\" His study of', 'Ovid, however, was of the greatest use in developing his critical faculty;', 'the excesses and want of judgment in that poet forced him to reflect, and', 'his observations on the style of his author anticipate his excellent', 'remarks on the difference between True and False Wit in the sixty-second', 'number of the _Spectator_.', '', 'Whoever, indeed, compares these notes with the _Essay on the Georgics_,', 'and with the opinions expressed in the _Account of the English Poets_,', 'will be convinced that the foundations of his critical method were laid at', 'this period (1697).

He showed his appreciation of the Poet-Laureate's\", 'genius by deducting £100 from the salary which his brother had promised', 'him, and by cutting off from the emoluments of the office the', 'time-honoured butt of canary!', '', 'Under William III. the complexion of affairs again altered. The Court, in', 'the old sense of the word, ceased to be a paramount influence in', 'literature. William III. derived his authority from Parliament; he knew', 'that he must support it mainly by his sword and his statesmanship. A', 'stranger to England, its manners and its language, he showed little', 'disposition to encourage letters. Pope, indeed, maliciously suggests that', 'he had the bad taste to admire the poetry of Blackmore, whom he knighted;', 'but, as a matter of fact, the honour was conferred on the worthy Sir', 'Richard in consequence of his distinction in medicine, and he himself', \"bears witness to William's contempt for poetry.\", '', '  \"Reverse of Louis he, example rare,', '  Loved to deserve the praise he could not bear.', '  He shunned the acclamations of the throng,', \"  And always coldly heard the poet's song.\", '  Hence the great King the Muses did neglect,', '  And the mere poet met with small respect.\"[17]', '', 'Such political verse as we find in this reign generally consists, like', \"Halifax's _Epistle to Lord Dorset_, or Addison's own _Address to King\", 'William_, of hyperbolical flattery. Opposition was extinct, for both', 'parties had for the moment united to promote the Revolution, and the only', 'discordant notes amid the chorus of adulation proceeded from Jacobite', 'writers concealed in the garrets and cellars of Grub Street. Such an', 'atmosphere was not favorable to the production of literature of an', 'elevated or even of a characteristic order.', '', \"Addison's return to England coincided most happily with another remarkable\", 'turn of the tide. Leaning decidedly to the Tory party, who were now', 'strongly leavened with the Jacobite element, Anne had not long succeeded', 'to the throne before she seized an opportunity for dismissing the Whig', 'Ministry whom she found in possession of office. The Whigs, equally', 'alarmed at the influence acquired by their rivals, and at the danger which', 'threatened the Protestant succession, neglected no effort to', \"counterbalance the loss of their sovereign's favour by strengthening their\", 'credit with the people. Having been trained in a school which had at least', 'qualified them to appreciate the influence of style, the aristocratic', 'leaders of the party were well aware of the advantages they would derive', 'by attracting to themselves the services of the ablest writers of the day.', 'Hence they made it their policy to mingle with men of letters on an equal', 'footing, and to hold out to them an expectation of a share in the', 'advantages to be reaped from the overthrow of their rivals.', '', 'The result of this union of forces was a great increase in the number of', 'literary-political clubs. In its half-aristocratic, half-democratic', 'constitution the club was the natural product of enlarged political', 'freedom, and helped to extend the organisation of polite opinion beyond', 'the narrow orbit of Court society. Addison himself, in his simple style,', 'points out the nature of the fundamental principle of Association which he', 'observed in operation all around him. \"When a set of men find themselves', 'agree in any particular, though never so trivial, they establish', 'themselves into a kind of fraternity, and meet once or twice a week upon', 'the account of such a fantastic resemblance.\"[18] Among these societies,', 'in the first years of the eighteenth century, the most celebrated was,', 'perhaps, the Kit-Kat Club. It consisted of thirty-nine of the leading men', 'of the Whig party; and, though many of these were of the highest rank, it', 'is a characteristic fact that the founder of the club should have been the', 'bookseller Jacob Tonson. It was probably through his influence, joined to', 'that of Halifax, that Addison was elected a member of the society soon', 'after his return to England. Among its prominent members was the Duke of', 'Somerset, the first meeting between whom and Addison, after the', 'correspondence that had passed between them, must have been somewhat', \"embarrassing. The club assembled at one Christopher Catt's, a pastry-cook,\", 'who gave his name both to the society and the mutton-pies which were its', 'ordinary entertainment. Each member was compelled to select a lady as his', 'toast, and the verses which he composed in her honour were engraved on the', 'wine-glasses belonging to the club. Addison chose the Countess of', 'Manchester, whose acquaintance he had made in Paris, and complimented her', 'in the following lines:', '', '  \"While haughty Gallia\\'s dames, that spread', \"  O'er their pale cheeks an artful red,\", '  Beheld this beauteous stranger there,', '  In native charms divinely fair,', '  Confusion in their looks they showed,', '  And with unborrowed blushes glowed.\"', '', 'Circumstances seemed now to be conspiring in favour of the Whigs. The', 'Tories, whose strength lay mainly in the Jacobite element, were jealous of', \"Marlborough's ascendency over the Queen; on the other hand, the Duchess of\", \"Marlborough, who was rapidly acquiring the chief place in Anne's\", 'affections, intrigued in favour of the opposite faction. In spite, too, of', 'her Tory predilections, the Queen, finding her throne menaced by the', 'ambition of Louis XIV., was compelled in self-defence to look for support', 'to the party which had most vigorously identified itself with the', 'principles of the Revolution. She bestowed her unreserved confidence on', 'Marlborough, and he, in order to counterbalance the influence of the', 'Jacobites, threw himself into the arms of the Whigs. Being named', 'Captain-General in 1704, he undertook the campaign which he brought to so', 'glorious a conclusion on the 2d of August in that year at the battle of', 'Blenheim.', '', 'Godolphin, who, in the absence of Marlborough, occupied the chief place in', 'the Ministry, moved perhaps by patriotic feeling, and no doubt also by a', 'sense of the advantage which his party would derive from this great', 'victory, was anxious that it should be commemorated in adequate verse. He', 'accordingly applied to Halifax as the person to whom the _sacer vates_', 'required for the occasion would probably be known. Halifax has had the', 'misfortune to have his character transmitted to posterity by two poets who', 'hated him either on public or private grounds. Swift describes him as the', 'would-be \"Mæcenas of the nation,\" but insinuates that he neglected the', 'wants of the poets whom he patronised:', '', '  \"Himself as rich as fifty Jews,', '  Was easy though they wanted shoes.\"', '', 'Pope also satirises the vanity and meanness of his disposition in the', 'well-known character of Bufo. Such portraits, though they are justified to', 'some extent by evidence coming from other quarters, are not to be too', 'strictly examined as if they bore the stamp of historic truth. It is, at', 'any rate, certain that Halifax always proved himself a warm and zealous', 'friend to Addison, and when Godolphin applied to him for a poet to', 'celebrate Blenheim, he answered that, though acquainted with a person who', 'possessed every qualification for the task, he could not ask him to', 'undertake it. Being pressed for his reasons, he replied \"that while too', 'many fools and blockheads were maintained in their pride and luxury at the', 'public expense, such men as were really an honour to their age and country', 'were shamefully suffered to languish in obscurity; that, for his own', 'share, he would never desire any gentleman of parts and learning to employ', 'his time in celebrating a Ministry who had neither the justice nor the', 'generosity to make it worth his while.\" In answer to this the Lord', 'Treasurer assured Halifax that any person whom he might name as equal to', 'the required task, should have no cause to repent of having rendered his', 'assistance; whereupon Halifax mentioned Addison, but stipulated that all', 'advances to the latter must come from Godolphin himself. Accordingly,', 'Boyle, Chancellor of the Exchequer, afterwards Lord Carleton, was', 'despatched on the embassy, and, if Pope is to be trusted, found Addison', 'lodged up three pair of stairs over a small shop. He opened to him the', 'subject, and informed him that, in return for the service that was', 'expected of him, he was instructed to offer him a Commissionership of', 'Appeal in the Excise, as a pledge of more considerable advancement in the', 'future. The fruits of this negotiation were _The Campaign_.', '', 'Warton disposes of the merits of _The Campaign_ with the cavalier', 'criticism, so often since repeated, that it is merely \"a gazette in', 'rhyme.\" In one sense the judgment is no doubt just. As a poem, _The', 'Campaign_ shows neither loftiness of invention nor enthusiasm of personal', \"feeling, and it cannot therefore be ranked with such an ode as Horace's\", \"_Qualem ministrum_, or with Pope's very fine _Epistle_ to the Earl of\", 'Oxford after his disgrace. Its methodical narrative style is scarcely', \"misrepresented by Warton's sarcastic description of it; but it should be\", 'remembered that this style was adopted by Addison with deliberate', 'intention. \"Thus,\" says he, in the conclusion of the poem,', '', '  \"Thus would I fain Britannia\\'s wars rehearse', '  In the smooth records of a faithful verse;', \"  That, if such numbers can o'er time prevail,\", '  May tell posterity the wondrous tale.', '  When actions unadorned are faint and weak', '  Cities and countries must be taught to speak;', '  Gods may descend in factions from the skies,', '  And rivers from their oozy beds arise;', '  Fiction may deck the truth with spurious rays,', '  And round the hero cast a borrowed blaze.', \"  Marlbro's exploits appear divinely bright,\", '  And proudly shine in their own native light;', '  Raised in themselves their genuine charms they boast,', '  And those that paint them truest praise them most.\"', '', 'The design here avowed is certainly not poetical, but it is eminently', 'business-like and extremely well adapted to the end in view. What', 'Godolphin wanted was a set of complimentary verses on Marlborough.', 'Addison, with infinite tact, declares that the highest compliment that can', 'be paid to the hero is to recite his actions in their unadorned grandeur.', 'This happy turn of flattery shows how far he had advanced in literary', 'skill since he wrote his address _To the King_. He had then excused', \"himself for the inadequate celebration of William's deeds on the plea\", \"that, great though these might be, they were too near the poet's own time\", 'to be seen in proper focus. A thousand years hence, he suggests, some', 'Homer may be inspired by the theme, \"and Boyne be sung when it has ceased', 'to flow.\" This could not have been very consolatory to a mortal craving', 'for contemporary applause, and the apology offered in _The Campaign_ for', 'the prosaic treatment of the subject is far more dexterous. Bearing in', 'mind the fact that it was written to order, and that the poet deliberately', 'declined to avail himself of the aid of fiction, we must allow that the', 'construction of the poem exhibits both art and dignity. The allusion to', 'the vast slaughter at Blenheim, in the opening paragraph--', '', '  \"Rivers of blood I see and hills of slain,', '  An Iliad rising out of one campaign\"--', '', 'is not very fortunate; but the lines describing the ambition of Louis XIV.', 'are weighty and dignified, and the couplet indicating, through the single', 'image of the Danube, the vast extent of the French encroachments, shows', 'how thoroughly Addison was imbued with the spirit of classical poetry:', '', '  \"The rising Danube its long race began,', '  And half its course through the new conquests ran.\"', '', 'With equal felicity he describes the position and intervention of England,', 'seizing at the same time the opportunity for a panegyric on her free', 'institutions:', '', '  \"Thrice happy Britain, from the kingdoms rent', '  To sit the guardian of the Continent!', '  That sees her bravest sons advanced so high', \"  And flourishing so near her prince's eye;\", \"  Thy favourites grow not up by fortune's sport,\", '  Or from the crimes and follies of a court:', '  On the firm basis of desert they rise,', \"  From long-tried faith and friendship's holy ties,\", \"  Their sovereign's well-distinguished smiles they share,\", '  Her ornaments in peace, her strength in war;', '  The nation thanks them with a public voice,', '  By showers of blessings Heaven approves their choice;', '  Envy itself is dumb, in wonder lost,', '  And factions strive who shall applaud them most.\"', '', 'He proceeds in a stream of calm and equal verse, enlivened by dexterous', 'allusions and occasional happy turns of expression, to describe the', 'scenery of the Moselle; the march between the Maese and the Danube; the', 'heat to which the army was exposed; the arrival on the Neckar; and the', 'track of devastation left by the French armies.

Marlborough', \"'teaches the battle to rage;' the angel 'directs the storm;' Marlborough\", \"is 'unmoved in peaceful thought;' the angel is 'calm and serene;'\", \"Marlborough stands 'unmoved amid the shock of hosts;' the angel rides\", \"'calm in the whirlwind.' The lines on Marlborough are just and noble; but\", 'the simile gives almost the same images a second time.\"', '', 'This judgment would be unimpeachable if the force of the simile lay solely', 'in the likeness between Marlborough and the angel, but it is evident that', 'equal stress is to be laid on the resemblance between the battle and the', \"storm. It was Addison's intention to raise in the mind of the reader the\", 'noblest possible idea of composure and design in the midst of confusion:', 'to do this he selected an angel as the minister of the divine purpose, and', 'a storm as the symbol of fury and devastation; and, in order to heighten', 'his effect, he recalls with true art the violence of the particular', 'tempest which had recently ravaged the country. Johnson has noticed the', 'close similarity between the persons of Marlborough and the angel; but he', 'has exaggerated the resemblance between the actions in which they are', 'severally engaged.', '', '_The Campaign_ completely fulfilled the purpose for which it was written.', 'It strengthened the position of the Whig Ministry, and secured for its', 'author the advancement that had been promised him. Early in 1706 Addison,', 'on the recommendation of Lord Godolphin, was promoted from the', 'Commissionership of Appeals in Excise to be Under-Secretary of State to', 'Sir Charles Hedges. The latter was one of the few Tories who had retained', 'their position in the Ministry since the restoration of the Whigs to the', 'favour of their sovereign, and he, too, shortly vanished from the stage', 'like his more distinguished friends, making way for the Earl of', 'Sunderland, a staunch Whig, and son-in-law to the Duke of Marlborough.', '', \"Addison's duties as Under-Secretary were probably not particularly\", 'arduous. In 1705 he was permitted to attend Lord Halifax to the Court of', 'Hanover, whither the latter was sent to carry the Act for the', 'Naturalisation of the Electress Sophia. The mission also included', 'Vanbrugh, who, as Clarencieux King-at-Arms, was charged to invest the', 'Elector with the Order of the Garter; the party thus constituted affording', 'a remarkable illustration of the influence exercised by literature over', 'the politics of the period. Addison must have obtained during this journey', \"considerable insight into the nature of England's foreign policy, as,\", 'besides establishing the closest relations with Hanover, Halifax was also', 'instructed to form an alliance with the United Provinces for securing the', 'succession of the House of Brunswick to the English throne.', '', 'In the meantime his imagination was not idle. After helping Steele in the', 'composition of his _Tender Husband_, which was acted in 1705, he found', 'time for engaging in a fresh literary enterprise of his own. The', 'principles of operatic music, which had long been developed in Italy, had', 'been slow in making their way to this country. Their introduction had been', 'delayed partly by the French prejudices of Charles II., but more, perhaps,', 'by the strong insular tastes of the people, and by the vigorous forms of', 'the native drama. What the untutored English audience liked best to hear', 'was a well-marked tune, sung in a fine natural way: the kind of music', 'which was in vogue on the stage till the end of the seventeenth century', 'was simply the regular drama interspersed with airs; _recitative_ was', 'unknown; and there was no attempt to cultivate the voice according to the', 'methods practised in the Italian schools. But with the increase of wealth', 'and travel more exacting tastes began to prevail; Italian singers appeared', 'on the stage and exhibited to the audience capacities of voice of which', 'they had hitherto had no experience. In 1705 was acted at the Haymarket', '_Arsinoe_, the first opera constructed in England on avowedly Italian', 'principles. The words were still in English, but the dialogue was', 'throughout in _recitative_. The composer was Thomas Clayton, who, though a', 'man entirely devoid of genius, had travelled in Italy, and was eager to', 'turn to account the experience which he had acquired. In spite of its', 'badness _Arsinoe_ greatly impressed the public taste; and it was soon', 'followed by _Camilla_, a version of an opera by Bononcini, portions of', 'which were sung in Italian, and portions in English--an absurdity on which', 'Addison justly comments in a number of the _Spectator_. His remarks on the', 'consequences of translating the Italian operas are equally humorous and', 'just.', '', '    \"As there was no great danger,\" says he, \"of hurting the sense of', '    these extraordinary pieces, our authors would often make words of', '    their own which were entirely foreign to the meaning of the passages', '    they pretended to translate; their chief care being to make the', '    numbers of the English verse answer to those of the Italian, that both', '    of them might go to the same tune. Thus the famous song in _Camilla_,', '', \"        'Barbara si t'intendo,' etc.\", \"        'Barbarous woman, yes, I know your meaning,'\", '', '    which expresses the resentment of an angry lover, was translated into', '    that English lamentation,', '', \"        'Frail are a lover's hopes,' etc.\", '', '    And it was pleasant enough to see the most refined persons of the', '    British nation dying away and languishing to notes that were filled', '    with the spirit of rage and indignation. It happened also very', '    frequently where the sense was rightly translated; the necessary', '    transposition of words, which were drawn out of the phrase of one', '    tongue into that of another, made the music appear very absurd in one', '    tongue that was very natural in the other. I remember an Italian verse', '    that ran thus, word for word:', '', \"        'And turned my rage into pity,'\", '', \"    which the English, for rhyme's sake, translated,\", '', \"        'And into pity turned my rage.'\", '', '    By this means the soft notes that were adapted to pity in the Italian', \"    fell upon the word 'rage' in the English; and the angry sounds that\", '    were turned to rage in the original were made to express pity in the', '    translation. It oftentimes happened likewise that the finest notes in', '    the air fell upon the most insignificant word in the sentence. I have', \"    known the word 'and' pursued through the whole gamut; have been\", \"    entertained with many a melodious 'the;' and have heard the most\", \"    beautiful graces, quavers, and divisions bestowed upon 'then,' 'for,'\", '    and \\'from,\\' to the eternal honour of our English particles.\"[19]', '', 'Perceiving these radical defects, Addison seems to have been ambitious of', 'showing by example how they might be remedied. \"The great success this', 'opera (_Arsinoe_) met with produced,\" says he, \"some attempts of forming', 'pieces upon Italian plans, which should give a more natural and reasonable', 'entertainment than what can be met with in the elaborate trifles of that', 'nation. This alarmed the poetasters and fiddlers of the town, who were', 'used to deal in a more ordinary kind of ware, and therefore laid down an', \"established rule, which is received as such to this day, 'That nothing is\", 'capable of being well set to music that is not nonsense.\\'\"[20] The', \"allusion to the failure of the writer's own opera of _Rosamond_ is\", 'unmistakable. The piece was performed on the 2d of April, 1706, but was', 'coldly received, and after two or three representations was withdrawn.', '', 'The reasons which the _Spectator_ assigns for the catastrophe betray', 'rather the self-love of the author than the clear perception of the', 'critic. _Rosamond_ failed because, in the first place, it was very bad as', 'a musical composition. Misled by the favour with which _Arsinoe_ was', 'received, Addison seems to have regarded Clayton as a great musician, and', 'he put his poem into the hands of the latter, thinking that his score', 'would be as superior to that of _Arsinoe_ as his own poetry was to the', 'words of that opera. Clayton, however, had no genius, and only succeeded', 'in producing what Sir John Hawkins, quoting with approbation the words of', 'another critic, calls \"a confused chaos of music, the only merit of which', 'is its shortness.\"[21]', '', 'But it may be doubted whether in any case the most skilful composer could', 'have produced music of a high order adapted to the poetry of _Rosamond_.', 'The play is neither a tragedy, a comedy, nor a melodrama. It seems that', 'Eleanor did not really poison Fair Rosamond, but only administered to her', 'a sleeping potion, and, as she takes care to explain to the King,', '', '  \"The bowl with drowsy juices filled,', '  From cold Egyptian drugs distilled,', '  In borrowed death has closed her eyes.\"', '', 'This information proves highly satisfactory to the King, not only because', 'he is gratified to find that Rosamond is not dead, but also because, even', 'before discovering her supposed dead body, he had resolved, in consequence', 'of a dream sent to him by his guardian angel, to terminate the relations', 'existing between them. The Queen and he accordingly arrange, in a', 'business-like manner, that Rosamond shall be quietly removed in her trance', 'to a nunnery; a reconciliation is then effected between the husband and', 'wife, who, as we are led to suppose, live happily ever after.', '', \"The main motive of the opera in Addison's mind appears to have been the\", 'desire of complimenting the Marlborough family. It is dedicated to the', 'Duchess; the warlike character of Henry naturally recalls the prowess of', 'the great modern captain; and the King is consoled by his guardian angel', 'for the loss of Fair Rosamond with a vision of the future glories of', 'Blenheim:', '', '  \"To calm thy grief and lull thy cares,', '      Look up and see', '  What, after long revolving years,', '      Thy bower shall be!', '  When time its beauties shall deface,', '  And only with its ruins grace', '  The future prospect of the place!', '  Behold the glorious pile ascending,', '  Columns swelling, arches bending,', '  Domes in awful pomp arising,', '  Art in curious strokes surprising,', '  Foes in figured fights contending,', '  Behold the glorious pile ascending.\"', '', 'This is graceful enough, but it scarcely offers material for music of a', 'serious kind. Nor can the Court have been greatly impressed by the', 'compliment paid to its morality, as contrasted with that of Charles II.,', 'conveyed as it was by the mouth of Grideline, one of the comic characters', 'in the piece--', '', '      \"Since conjugal passion', '      Is come into fashion,', '  And marriage so blest on the throne is,', \"      Like a Venus I'll shine,\", '      Be fond and be fine,', '  And Sir Trusty shall be my Adonis.\"', '', \"The ill success of _Rosamond_ confirmed Addison's dislike to the Italian\", 'opera, which he displayed both in his grave and humorous papers on the', 'subject in the _Spectator_. The disquisition upon the various actors of', 'the lion in _Hydaspes_ is one of his happiest inspirations; but his', 'serious criticisms are, as a rule, only just in so far as they are', 'directed against the dramatic absurdities of the Italian opera. As to his', 'technical qualifications as a critic of music, it will be sufficient to', 'cite the opinion of Dr. Burney: \"To judges of music nothing more need be', \"said of Mr. Addison's abilities to decide concerning the comparative\", 'degrees of national excellence in the art, and the merit of particular', 'masters, than his predilection for the productions of Clayton, and', \"insensibility to the force and originality of Handel's compositions in\", '_Rinaldo_.\"[22]', '', 'In December, 1708, the Earl of Sunderland was displaced to make room for', 'the Tory Lord Dartmouth, and Addison, as Under-Secretary, following the', 'fortunes of his superior, found himself again without employment.', 'Fortunately for him the Earl of Wharton was almost immediately afterwards', 'made Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and offered him the lucrative post of', 'Secretary. The Earl, who was subsequently created a Marquis, was the', \"father of the famous Duke satirised in Pope's first _Moral Essay_; he was\", 'in every respect the opposite of Addison--a vehement Republican, a', 'sceptic, unprincipled in his morals, venal in his methods of Government.', 'He was nevertheless a man of the finest talents, and seems to have', 'possessed the power of gaining personal ascendency over his companions by', 'a profound knowledge of character. An acquaintance with Addison, doubtless', 'commencing at the Kit-Kat Club, of which both were members, had convinced', 'him that the latter had eminent qualifications for the task, which the', \"Secretary's post would involve, of dealing with men of very various\", 'conditions. Of the feelings with which Addison on his side regarded the', 'Earl we have no record. \"It is reasonable to suppose,\" says Johnson, \"that', 'he counteracted, as far as he was able, the malignant and blasting', 'influence of the Lieutenant; and that, at least, by his intervention some', 'good was done and some mischief prevented.\" Not a shadow of an imputation,', 'at any rate, rests upon his own conduct as Secretary. He appears to have', 'acted strictly on that conception of public duty which he defines in one', 'of his papers in the _Spectator_. Speaking of the marks of a corrupt', 'official, \"Such an one,\" he declares, \"is the man who, upon any pretence', 'whatsoever, receives more than what is the stated and unquestioned fee of', 'his office. Gratifications, tokens of thankfulness, despatch money, and', 'the like specious terms, are the pretences under which corruption very', 'frequently shelters itself. An honest man will, however, look on all these', 'methods as unjustifiable, and will enjoy himself better in a moderate', 'fortune, that is gained with honour and reputation, than in an overgrown', 'estate that is cankered with the acquisitions of rapine and exaction. Were', 'all our offices discharged with such an inflexible integrity, we should', 'not see men in all ages, who grow up to exorbitant wealth, with the', 'abilities which are to be met with in an ordinary mechanic.\"[23] His', 'friends perhaps considered that his impartiality was somewhat', 'overstrained, since he always declined to remit the customary fees in', 'their favour. \"For,\" said he, \"I may have forty friends, whose fees may be', 'two guineas a-piece; then I lose eighty guineas, and my friends gain but', 'two a-piece.\"', '', 'He took with him as his own Secretary, Eustace Budgell, who was related to', 'him, and for whom he seems to have felt a warm affection. Budgell was a', 'man of considerable literary ability, and was the writer of the various', 'papers in the _Spectator_ signed \"X,\" some of which succeed happily in', \"imitating Addison's style. While he was under his friend's guidance his\", 'career was fairly successful, but his temper was violent, and when, at a', 'later period of his life, he served in Ireland under a new Lieutenant and', 'another Secretary, he became involved in disputes which led to his', 'dismissal. A furious pamphlet against the Lord-Lieutenant, the Duke of', \"Bolton, published by him in spite of Addison's remonstrances, only\", 'complicated his position, and from this period his fortunes steadily', 'declined.

In short,', 'if you will come over again when you are at leisure we will raise an army', 'and make you King of Ireland. Can you think so meanly of a kingdom as not', 'to be pleased that every creature in it, who hath one grain of worth, has', 'a veneration for you?\" In his _Journal to Stella_ he says, under date of', 'October 12, 1710: \"Mr. Addison\\'s election has passed easy and undisputed;', 'and I believe if he had a mind to be chosen king he would hardly be', 'refused.\" On his side Addison\\'s feelings were equally warm. He presented', 'Swift with a copy of his _Remarks on Several Parts of Italy_, inscribing', 'it--\"To the most agreeable companion, the truest friend, and the greatest', 'genius of his age.\"', '', 'This friendship, founded on mutual respect, was destined to be impaired by', 'political differences. In 1710 the credit of the Whig Ministry had been', 'greatly undermined by the combined craft of Harley and Mrs. Masham, and', 'Swift, who was anxious as to his position, on coming over to England to', 'press his claims on Somers and Halifax, found that they were unable to', 'help him. He appears to have considered that their want of power proceeded', 'from want of will; at any rate, he made advances to Harley, which were of', 'course gladly received. The Ministry were at this time being hard pressed', 'by the _Examiner_, under the conduct of Prior, and at their instance', 'Addison started the _Whig Examiner_ in their defence. Though this paper', 'was written effectively and with admirable temper, party polemics were', 'little to the taste of its author, and, after five numbers, it ceased to', 'exist on the 8th of October. Swift, now eager for the triumph of the', 'Tories, expresses his delight to Stella by informing her, in the words of', 'a Tory song, that \"it was down among the dead men.\" He himself wrote the', 'first of his _Examiners_ on the 2d of the following November, and the', 'crushing blows with which he followed it up did much to hasten the', 'downfall of the Ministry. As was natural, Addison was somewhat displeased', 'at his friend\\'s defection. In December Swift writes to Stella, \"Mr.', 'Addison and I are as different as black and white, and I believe our', 'friendship will go off by this d---- business of party. He cannot bear', 'seeing me fall in so with the Ministry; but I love him still as much as', 'ever, though we seldom meet.\" In January, 1710-11, he says: \"I called at', 'the coffee-house, where I had not been in a week, and talked coldly awhile', 'with Mr. Addison; all our friendship and dearness are off; we are civil', \"acquaintance, talk words, of course, of when we shall meet, and that's\", 'all. Is it not odd?\" Many similar entries follow; but on June 26, 1711,', 'the record is: \"Mr. Addison and I talked as usual, and as if we had seen', 'one another yesterday.\" And on September 14, he observes: \"This evening I', 'met Addison and pastoral Philips in the Park, and supped with them in', \"Addison's lodgings. We were very good company, and I yet know no man half\", 'so agreeable to me as he is. I sat with them till twelve.\"', '', 'It was perhaps through the influence of Swift, who spoke warmly with the', 'Tory Ministry on behalf of Addison, that the latter, on the downfall of', 'the Whigs in the autumn of 1710, was for some time suffered to retain the', \"Keepership of the Records in Bermingham's Tower, an Irish place which had\", 'been bestowed upon him by the Queen as a special mark of the esteem with', 'which she regarded him, and which appears to have been worth £400 a', 'year.[24] In other respects his fortunes were greatly altered by the', 'change of Ministry. \"I have within this twelvemonth,\" he writes to Wortley', 'on the 21st of July, 1711, \"lost a place of £2000 per ann., an estate in', 'the Indies worth £14,000, and, what is worse than all the rest, my', 'mistress.[25] Hear this and wonder at my philosophy! I find they are going', 'to take away my Irish place from me too; to which I must add that I have', 'just resigned my fellowship, and that stocks sink every day.\" In spite of', 'these losses his circumstances were materially different from those in', 'which he found himself after the fall of the previous Whig Ministry in', '1702. Before the close of the year 1711 he was able to buy the estate of', 'Bilton, near Rugby, for £10,000. Part of the purchase money was probably', 'provided from what he had saved while he was Irish Secretary, and had', 'invested in the funds; and part was, no doubt, made up from the profits of', 'the _Tatler_ and the _Spectator_. Miss Aikin says that a portion was', 'advanced by his brother Gulston; but this seems to be an error. Two years', 'before, the Governor of Fort St. George had died, leaving him his executor', 'and residuary legatee. This is no doubt \"the estate in the Indies\" to', 'which he refers in his letter to Wortley, but he had as yet derived no', 'benefit from it. His brother had left his affairs in great confusion; the', 'trustees were careless or dishonest; and though about £600 was remitted to', 'him in the shape of diamonds in 1713, the liquidation was not complete', 'till 1716, when only a small moiety of the sum bequeathed to him came into', 'his hands.[26]', '', '', '', '']\n",
            "['CHAPTER V.', '', 'THE _TATLER_ AND _SPECTATOR_.', '', '', 'The career of Addison, as described in the preceding chapters, has', 'exemplified the great change effected in the position of men of letters in', 'England by the Restoration and the Revolution; it is now time to exhibit', 'him in his most characteristic light, and to show the remarkable service', 'the eighteenth century essayists performed for English society in creating', 'an organised public opinion. It is difficult for ourselves, who look on', 'the action of the periodical press as part of the regular machinery of', 'life, to appreciate the magnitude of the task accomplished by Addison and', 'Steele in the pages of the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_. Every day, week,', 'month, and quarter now sees the issue of a vast number of journals and', 'magazines intended to form the opinion of every order and section of', 'society; but in the reign of Queen Anne the only centres of society that', 'existed were the Court, with the aristocracy that revolved about it, and', 'the clubs and coffee-houses, in which the commercial and professional', 'classes met to discuss matters of general interest. The _Tatler_ and', '_Spectator_ were the first organs in which an attempt was made to give', 'form and consistency to the opinion arising out of this social contact.', 'But we should form a very erroneous idea of the character of these', 'publications if we regarded them as the sudden productions of individual', 'genius, written in satisfaction of a mere temporary taste. Like all', 'masterpieces in art and literature, they mark the final stage of a long', 'and painful journey, and the merit of their inventors consists largely in', 'the judgment with which they profited by the experience of many', 'predecessors.', '', 'The first newspaper published in Europe was the _Gazzetta_ of Venice,', 'which was written in manuscript, and read aloud at certain places in the', 'city, to supply information to the people during the war with the Turks in', '1536. In England it was not till the reign of Elizabeth that the increased', 'facilities of communication and the growth of wealth caused the purveyance', 'of news to become a profitable employment. Towards the end of the', 'sixteenth century newsmongers began to issue little pamphlets reporting', 'extraordinary intelligence, but not issued at regular periods. The titles', 'of these publications, which are all of them that survive, show that the', 'arts with which the framers of the placards of our own newspapers', 'endeavour to attract attention are of venerable antiquity: \"Wonderful and', 'Strange newes out of Suffolke and Essex, where it rained wheat the space', 'of six or seven miles\" (1583); \"Lamentable newes out of Monmouthshire,', 'containinge the wonderfull and fearfull accounts of the great overflowing', 'of the waters in the said countrye\" (1607).[27]', '', 'In 1622 one Nathaniel Butter began to publish a newspaper bearing a fixed', 'title and appearing at stated intervals. It was called the _Weekly Newes', 'from Italy and Germanie, etc._, and was said to be printed for _Mercurius', 'Britannicus_. This novelty provided much food for merriment to the poets,', 'and Ben Jonson in his _Staple of News_ satirises Butter, under the name', 'of Nathaniel, in a passage which the curious reader will do well to', 'consult, as it shows the low estimation in which newspapers were then', 'held.[28]', '', \"Though it might appear from Jonson's dialogue that the newspapers of that\", 'day contained many items of domestic intelligence, such was scarcely the', 'case. Butter and his contemporaries, as was natural to men who confined', 'themselves to the publication of news without attempting to form opinion,', 'obtained their materials almost entirely from abroad, whereby they at once', 'aroused more vividly the imagination of their readers, and doubtless gave', 'more scope to their own invention. Besides, they were not at liberty to', 'retail home news of that political kind which would have been of the', 'greatest interest to the public. For a long time the evanescent character', 'of the newspaper allowed it to escape the attention of the licenser, but', 'the growing demand for this sort of reading at last brought it under', 'supervision, and so strict was the control exercised over even the reports', 'of foreign intelligence that its weekly appearance was frequently', 'interrupted.', '', 'In 1641, however, the Star-chamber was abolished, and the heated political', 'atmosphere of the times generated a new species of journal, in which we', 'find the first attempt to influence opinion through the periodical press.', 'This was the newspaper known under the generic title of _Mercury_. Many', 'weekly publications of this name appeared during the Civil Wars on the', 'side of both King and Parliament, _Mercurius Anlicus_ being the', 'representative organ of the Royalist cause, and _Mercurius Pragmaticus_', 'and _Mercurius Politicus_ of the Republicans. Party animosities were thus', 'kept alive, and proved so inconvenient to the Government that the', 'Parliament interfered to curtail the liberty of the press. In 1647 an', 'ordinance passed the House of Lords, prohibiting any person from \"making,', 'writing, printing, selling, publishing, or uttering, or causing to be', 'made, any book, sheet, or sheets of news whatsoever, except the same be', 'licensed by both or either House of Parliament, with the name of the', 'author, printer, and licenser affixed.\" In spite of this prohibition,', 'which was renewed by Act of Parliament in 1662, many unlicensed', 'periodicals continued to appear, till in 1663 the Government, finding', 'their repressive measures insufficient, resolved to grapple with the', 'difficulty by monopolising the right to publish news.', '', \"The author of this new project was the well-known Roger L'Estrange, who in\", '1663 obtained a patent assigning to him \"all the sole privilege of', 'writing, printing, and publishing all Narratives, Advertisements,', 'Mercuries, Intelligencers, Diurnals, and other books of public', 'intelligence.\" L\\'Estrange\\'s journal was called the _Public Intelligencer_;', 'it was published once a week, and in its form was a rude anticipation of', 'the modern newspaper, containing as it did an obituary, reports of the', 'proceedings in Parliament and in the Court of Claims, a list of the', 'circuits of the judges, of sheriffs, Lent preachers, etc. After being', 'continued for two years it gave place first, in 1665, to the _Oxford', 'Gazette_, published at Oxford, whither the Court had retired during the', 'plague; and in 1666 to the _London Gazette_, which was under the immediate', 'control of an Under-Secretary of State. The office of Gazetteer became', 'henceforth a regular ministerial appointment, and was viewed with', 'different eyes according as men were affected towards the Government.', 'Steele, who held it, says of it: \"My next appearance as a writer was in', 'the quality of the lowest Minister of State--to wit, in the office of', 'Gazetteer; where I worked faithfully according to order, without ever', 'erring against the rule observed by all Ministers, to keep that paper very', 'innocent and very insipid.\" Pope, on the other hand, who regarded it as an', 'organ published to influence opinion in favour of the Government, is', 'constant in his attacks upon it, and has immortalised it in the memorable', 'lines in the _Dunciad_ beginning, \"Next plunged a feeble but a desperate', 'pack,\" etc.', '', 'In 1679 the Licensing Act passed in 1662 expired, and the Parliament', 'declined to renew it. The Court was thus left without protection against', 'the expression of public opinion, which was daily becoming more bold and', 'outspoken. In his extremity the King fell back on the servility of the', 'judges, and, having procured from them an opinion that the publishing of', 'any printed matter without license was contrary to the common law, he', 'issued his famous Proclamation (in 1680) \"to prohibit and forbid all', 'persons whatsoever to print or publish any news, book, or pamphlets of', 'news, not licensed by his Majesty\\'s authority.\"', '', 'Disregard of the proclamation was treated as a breach of the peace, and', 'many persons were punished accordingly. This severity produced the effect', 'intended. The voice of the periodical press was stifled, and the _London', 'Gazette_ was left almost in exclusive possession of the field of news.', 'When Monmouth landed in 1685 the King managed to obtain from Parliament a', 'renewal of the Licensing Act for seven years, and even after the', 'Revolution of 1688 several attempts were made by the Ministerial Whigs to', 'prolong or to renew the operation of the Act. In spite, however, of the', 'violence of the organs of \"Grub Street,\" which had grown up under it,', 'these attempts were unsuccessful; it was justly felt that it was wiser to', 'leave falsehood and scurrility to be gradually corrected by public', 'opinion, as speaking through an unfettered press, than to attack them by a', 'law which they had proved themselves able to defy. From 1682 the freedom', 'of the press may therefore be said to date, and the lapse of the Licensing', 'Act was the signal for a remarkable outburst of journalistic enterprise', 'and invention. Not only did the newspapers devoted to the report of', 'foreign intelligence reappear in greatly increased numbers, but, whereas', 'the old _Mercuries_ had never been published more than once in the same', 'week, the new comers made their appearance twice and sometimes even three', 'times. In 1702 was printed the first daily newspaper, _The Daily Courant_.', 'It could only at starting provide material to cover one side of a half', 'sheet of paper; but the other side was very soon covered with printed', 'matter, in which form its existence was prolonged till 1735.', '', 'The development of party government of course encouraged the controversial', 'capacities of the journalist, and many notorious, and some famous names', 'are now found among the combatants in the political arena. On the side of', 'the Whigs the most redoubtable champions were Daniel Defoe, of the', '_Review_, who was twice imprisoned and once set in the pillory for his', 'political writings; John Tutchin, of the _Observator_; and Ridpath, of the', '_Flying Post_--all of whom have obtained places in the _Dunciad_. The old', \"Tories appear to have been satisfied during the early part of Queen Anne's\", 'reign with prosecuting the newspapers that attacked them; but Harley, who', 'understood the power of the press, engaged Prior to harass the Whigs in', 'the _Examiner_, and was afterwards dexterous enough to secure the', 'invaluable assistance of Swift for the same paper. In opposition to the', '_Examiner_ in its early days the Whigs, as has been said, started the', '_Whig Examiner_, under the auspices of Addison, so that the two great', 'historical parties had their cases stated by the two greatest', 'prose-writers of the first half of the eighteenth century.', '', 'Beside the Quidnunc and the party politician, another class of reader now', 'appeared demanding aliment in the press. Men of active and curious minds,', \"with a little leisure and a large love of discussion, loungers at Will's\", 'or at the Grecian Coffee-Houses, were anxious to have their doubts on all', 'subjects resolved by a printed oracle. Their tastes were gratified by the', 'ingenuity of John Dunton, whose strange account of his _Life and Errors_', 'throws a strong light on the literary history of this period. In 1690', 'Dunton published his _Athenian Gazette_, the name of which he afterwards', 'altered to the _Athenian Mercury_. The object of this paper was to answer', 'questions put to the editor by the public. These were of all kinds--on', 'religion, casuistry, love, literature, and manners--no question being too', 'subtle or absurd to extract a reply from the conductor of the paper. The', '_Athenian Mercury_ seems to have been read by as many distinguished men of', 'the period as _Notes and Queries_ in our own time, and there can be no', 'doubt that the quaint humours it originated gave the first hint to the', 'inventors of the _Tatler_ and the _Spectator_.', '', 'Advertisements were inserted in the newspapers at a comparatively early', 'period of their existence. The editor acted as middleman between the', 'advertiser and the public, and made his announcements in a style of easy', 'frankness which will appear to the modern reader extremely refreshing.', 'Thus, in the \"Collection for the Improvement of Husbandry and Trade\"', '(1682), there are the following:', '', '    \"If I can meet with a sober man that has a counter-tenor voice, I can', '    help him to a place worth thirty pound the year or more.', '', '    \"If any noble or other gentleman wants a porter that is very lusty,', '    comely, and six foot high and two inches, I can help.', '', '    \"I want a complete young man that will wear a livery, to wait on a', '    very valuable gentleman; but he must know how to play on a violin or', '    flute.', '', '    \"I want a genteel footman that can play on the violin, to wait on a', '    person of honour.\"[29]', '', 'Everything was now prepared for the production of a class of newspaper', 'designed to form and direct public opinion on rational principles. The', 'press was emancipated from State control; a reading public had constituted', 'itself out of the _habitués_ of the coffee-houses and clubs; nothing was', 'wanted but an inventive genius to adapt the materials at his disposal to', 'the circumstances of the time. The required hero was not long in making', 'his appearance.', '', 'Richard Steele, the son of an official under the Irish Government, was,', 'above all things, \"a creature of ebullient heart.\" Impulse and sentiment', 'were with him always far stronger motives of action than reason,', 'principle, or even interest. He left Oxford, without taking a degree, from', 'an ardent desire to serve in the army, thereby sacrificing his prospect of', 'succeeding to a family estate; his extravagance and dissipation while', 'serving in the cavalry were notorious; yet this did not dull the clearness', 'of his moral perceptions, for it was while his excesses were at their', 'height that he dedicated to his commanding officer, Lord Cutts, his', '_Christian Hero_. Vehement in his political, as in all other feelings, he', 'did not hesitate to resign the office he held under the Tory Government in', '1711 in order to attack it for what he considered its treachery to the', 'country; but he was equally outspoken, and with equal disadvantage to', 'himself, when he found himself at a later period in disagreement with the', 'Whigs. He had great fertility of invention, strong natural humour, true', 'though uncultivated taste, and inexhaustible human sympathy.', '', 'His varied experience had made him well acquainted with life and', 'character, and in his office of Gazetteer he had had an opportunity of', 'watching the eccentricities of the public taste, which, now emancipated', 'from restraint, began vaguely to feel after new ideals. That, under such', 'circumstances, he should have formed the design of treating current events', 'from a humorous point of view was only natural, but he was indebted for', 'the form of his newspaper to the most original genius of the age. Swift', 'had early in the eighteenth century exercised his ironical vein by', 'treating the everyday occurrences of life in a mock-heroic style. Among', 'his pieces of this kind that were most successful in catching the public', 'taste were the humorous predictions of the death of Partridge, the', 'astrologer, signed with the name of Isaac Bickerstaff. Steele, seizing on', \"the name and character of Partridge's fictitious rival, turned him with\", 'much pleasantry into the editor of a new journal, the design of which he', 'makes Isaac describe as follows:', '', '    \"The state of conversation and business in this town having long been', \"    perplexed with Pretenders in both kinds, in order to open men's minds\", '    against such abuses, it appeared no unprofitable undertaking to', '    publish a Paper, which should observe upon the manners of the', '    pleasurable, as well as the busy part of mankind. To make this', '    generally read, it seemed the most proper method to form it by way of', '    a Letter of Intelligence, consisting of such parts as might gratify', '    the curiosity of persons of all conditions and of each sex.... The', '    general purposes of this Paper is to expose the false arts of life, to', '    pull off the disguises of cunning, vanity, and affectation, and to', '    recommend a general simplicity in our dress, our discourse, and our', '    behaviour.\"[30]', '', 'The name of the _Tatler_, Isaac informs us, was \"invented in honour of the', 'fair sex,\" for whose entertainment the new paper was largely designed. It', 'appeared three times a week, and its price was a penny, though it seems', 'that the first number, published April 12, 1709, was distributed _gratis_', 'as an advertisement. In order to make the contents of the paper varied it', 'was divided into five portions, of which the editor gives the following', 'account:', '', '    \"All accounts of Gallantry, Pleasure, and Entertainment, shall be', \"    under the article of White's Chocolate-House; Poetry under that of\", \"    Will's Coffee-House; Learning under the title of Grecian; Foreign and\", \"    Domestic News you will have from Saint James' Coffee-House; and what\", '    else I have to offer on any other subject shall be dated from my own', '    apartment.\"[31]', '', 'In this division we see the importance of the coffee-houses as the natural', 'centres of intelligence and opinion. Of the four houses mentioned, St.', \"James' and White's, both of them in St. James' Street, were the chief\", 'haunts of statesmen and men of fashion, and the latter had acquired an', \"infamous notoriety for the ruinous gambling of its _habitués_. Will's, in\", 'Russell Street, Covent Garden, kept up the reputation which it had', \"procured in Dryden's time as the favourite meeting-place of men of\", 'letters; while the Grecian, in Devereux Court in the Strand, which was the', 'oldest coffee-house in London, afforded a convenient _rendezvous_ for the', 'learned Templars. At starting, the design announced in the first number', \"was adhered to with tolerable fidelity. The paper dated from St. James'\", 'Coffee-House was always devoted to the recital of foreign news; that from', \"Will's either criticised the current dramas, or contained a copy of\", 'verses from some author of repute, or a piece of general literary', \"criticism; the latest gossip at White's was reproduced in a fictitious\", 'form and with added colour. Advertisements were also inserted; and half a', 'sheet of the paper was left blank, in order that at the last moment the', 'most recent intelligence might be added in manuscript, after the manner of', 'the contemporary news-letters. In all these respects the character of the', 'newspaper was preserved; but in the method of treating news adopted by the', 'editor there was a constant tendency to subordinate matter of fact to the', 'elements of humour, fiction, and sentiment. In his survey of the manners', 'of the time, Isaac, as an astrologer, was assisted by a familiar spirit,', 'named Pacolet, who revealed to him the motives and secrets of men; his', 'sister, Mrs. Jenny Distaff, was occasionally deputed to produce the paper', 'from the wizard\\'s \"own apartment;\" and Kidney, the waiter at St. James\\'', 'Coffee-House, was humorously represented as the chief authority in all', 'matters of foreign intelligence.', '', 'The mottoes assumed by the _Tatler_ at different periods of its existence', 'mark the stages of its development. On its first appearance, when Steele', 'seems to have intended it to be little more than a lively record of news,', 'the motto placed at the head of each paper was', '', '  \"Quidquid agunt homines,', '              nostri est farrago libelli.\"', '', 'It soon became evident, however, that its true function was not merely to', 'report the actions of men, but to discuss the propriety of their actions;', 'and by the time that sufficient material had accumulated to constitute a', 'volume, the essayists felt themselves justified in appropriating the words', 'used by Pliny in the preface to his _Natural History_:', '', '    \"Nemo apud nos qui idem tentaverit: equidem sentio peculiarem in', '    studiis causam corum esse, qui difficultatibus victis, utilitatem', '    juvandi, protulerunt gratiæ placendi.

Itaque NON ASSECUTIS', '    _voluisse_, abunde pulchrum atque magnificum est.\"', '', 'The disguise of the mock astrologer proved very useful to Steele in his', 'character of moralist. It enabled him to give free utterance to his better', 'feelings, without the risk of incurring the charge of inconsistency or', 'hypocrisy, and nothing can be more honourable to him than the open manner', 'in which he acknowledges his own unfitness for the position of a moralist:', '\"I shall not carry my humility so far,\" says he, \"as to call myself a', 'vicious man, but at the same time must confess my life is at best but', 'pardonable. With no greater character than this, a man would make but an', 'indifferent progress in attacking prevailing and fashionable vices, which', 'Mr. Bickerstaff has done with a freedom of spirit that would have lost', 'both its beauty and efficacy had it been pretended to by Mr. Steele.\"[32]', '', 'As Steele cannot claim the sole merit of having invented the form of the', '_Tatler_, so, too, it must be remembered that he could never have', 'addressed society in the high moral tone assumed by Bickerstaff if the', 'road had not been prepared for him by others. One name among his', 'predecessors stands out with a special title to honourable record. Since', 'the Restoration the chief school of manners had been the stage, and the', 'flagrant example of immorality set by the Court had been bettered by the', 'invention of the comic dramatists of the period. Indecency was the', 'fashion; religion and sobriety were identified by the polite world with', 'Puritanism and hypocrisy. Even the Church had not yet ventured to say a', 'word in behalf of virtue against the prevailing taste, and when at last a', 'clergyman raised his voice on behalf of the principles which he professed,', 'the blow which he dealt to his antagonists was the more damaging because', 'it was entirely unexpected. Jeremy Collier was not only a Tory but a', 'Jacobite, not only a High Churchman but a Nonjuror, who had been outlawed', 'for his fidelity to the principles of Legitimism; and that such a man', 'should have published the _Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of', 'the English Stage_, reflecting, as the book did, in the strongest manner', 'on the manners of the fallen dynasty, was as astounding as thunder from a', 'clear sky. Collier, however, was a man of sincere piety, whose mind was', 'for the moment occupied only by the overwhelming danger of the evil which', 'he proposed to attack. It is true that his method of attack was cumbrous,', 'and that his conclusions were far too sweeping and often unjust;', 'nevertheless, the general truth of his criticisms was felt to be', 'irresistible. Congreve and Vanbrugh each attempted an apology for their', 'profession; both, however, showed their perception of the weakness of', 'their position by correcting or recasting scenes in their comedies to', 'which Collier had objected. Dryden accepted the reproof in a nobler', 'spirit. Even while he had pandered to the tastes of the times, he had been', 'conscious of his treachery to the cause of true art, and had broken out in', 'a fine passage in his _Ode to the Memory of Mrs. Killigrew_:', '', '  \"O gracious God! how far have we', '  Profaned thy heavenly gift of poesy!', '  Made prostitute and profligate the Muse,', '  Debased to each obscene and impious use!', '', '     *       *       *       *       *', '', '  \"O wretched we! why were we hurried down', '    This lubrique and adulterous age', '  (Nay, added fat pollutions of our own)', '    To increase the streaming ordure of the stage?\"', '', 'When Collier attacked him he bent his head in submission. \"In many', 'things,\" says he, \"he has taxed me justly, and I have pleaded guilty to', 'all thought and expressions of mine which can be truly argued of', 'obscenity, profaneness, or immorality, and retract them. If he be my', 'enemy, let him triumph; if he be my friend, as I have given him no', 'personal occasion to be otherwise, he will be glad of my repentance.\"[33]', '', 'The first blow against fashionable immorality having been boldly struck,', 'was followed up systematically. In 1690 was founded \"The Society for the', 'Reformation of Manners,\" which published every year an account of the', 'progress made in suppressing profaneness and debauchery by its means. It', 'continued its operations till 1738, and during its existence prosecuted,', 'according to its own calculations, 101,683 persons. William III. showed', 'himself prompt to encourage the movement which his subjects had begun. The', '_London Gazette_ of 27th February, 1698-99, contains a report of the', 'following remarkable order:', '', '    \"His Majesty being informed, That, notwithstanding an order made the', '    4th of June, 1697, by the Earl of Sunderland, then Lord Chamberlain of', \"    His Majesty's Household, to prevent the Prophaneness and Immorality of\", '    the Stage, several Plays have been lately acted containing expressions', '    contrary to Religion and Good Manners: and whereas the Master of the', '    Revels has represented, That, in contempt of the said order, the', '    actors do often neglect to leave out such Prophane and Indecent', '    expressions as he has thought proper to be omitted.

In the eleventh year of his', '    Majesty\\'s reign.\"', '', 'It is difficult to realise, in reading the terms of this order, that only', 'thirteen years had elapsed since the death of Charles II., and undoubtedly', 'a very large share of the credit due for such a revolution in the public', 'taste is to be assigned to Collier. Collier, however, did nothing in a', 'literary or artistic sense to improve the character of English literature.', 'His severity, uncompromising as that of the Puritans, inspired Vice with', 'terror, but could not plead with persuasion on behalf of Virtue; his', 'sweeping conclusions struck at the roots of Art as well as of Immorality.', 'He sought to destroy the drama and kindred pleasures of the Imagination,', 'not to reform them. What the age needed was a writer to satisfy its', 'natural desires for healthy and rational amusement, and Steele, with his', 'strongly-developed twofold character, was the man of all others to bridge', 'over the chasm between irreligious licentiousness and Puritanical', 'rigidity. Driven headlong on one side of his nature towards all the tastes', 'and pleasures which absorbed the Court of Charles II., his heart in the', 'midst of his dissipation never ceased to approve of whatever was great,', 'noble, and generous. He has described himself with much feeling in his', 'disquisition on the _Rake_, a character which he says many men are', 'desirous of assuming without any natural qualifications for supporting it:', '', '    \"A Rake,\" says he, \"is a man always to be pitied; and if he lives one', '    day is certainly reclaimed; for his faults proceed not from choice or', '    inclination, but from strong passions and appetites, which are in', '    youth too violent for the curb of reason, good sense, good manners,', '    and good nature; all which he must have by nature and education', '    before he can be allowed to be or to have been of this order.... His', '    desires run away with him through the strength and force of a lively', '    imagination, which hurries him on to unlawful pleasures before reason', '    has power to come in to his rescue.\"', '', 'That impulsiveness of feeling which is here described, and which was the', \"cause of so many of Steele's failings in real life, made him the most\", 'powerful and persuasive advocate of Virtue in fiction. Of all the', 'imaginative English essayists he is the most truly natural. His large', 'heart seems to rush out in sympathy with any tale of sorrow or exhibition', 'of magnanimity; and even in criticism, his true natural instinct, joined', 'to his constitutional enthusiasm, often raises his judgments to a level', 'with those of Addison himself, as in his excellent essay in the', \"_Spectator_ on Raphael's cartoons. Examples of these characteristics in\", 'his style are to be found in the _Story of Unnion and Valentine_,[34] and', 'in the fine paper describing two tragedies of real life;[35] in the series', 'of papers on duelling, occasioned by a duel into which he was himself', 'forced against his own inclination;[36] and in the sound advice which', 'Isaac gives to his half-sister Jenny on the morrow of her marriage.[37]', 'Perhaps, however, the chivalry and generosity of feeling which make', \"Steele's writings so attractive are most apparent in the delightful paper\", 'containing the letter of Serjeant Hall from the camp before Mons. After', \"pointing out to his readers the admirable features in the serjeant's\", 'simple letter, Steele concludes as follows:', '', '    \"If we consider the heap of an army, utterly out of all prospect of', '    rising and preferment, as they certainly are, and such great things', '    executed by them, it is hard to account for the motive of their', '    gallantry. But to me, who was a cadet at the battle of Coldstream, in', '    Scotland, when Monk charged at the head of the regiment now called', '    Coldstream, from the victory of that day--I remember it as well as if', '    it were yesterday; I stood on the left of old West, who I believe is', '    now at Chelsea--I say to me, who know very well this part of mankind,', '    I take the gallantry of private soldiers to proceed from the same, if', '    not from a nobler, impulse than that of gentlemen and officers. They', '    have the same taste of being acceptable to their friends, and go', '    through the difficulties of that profession by the same irresistible', '    charm of fellowship and the communication of joys and sorrows which', '    quickens the relish of pleasure and abates the anguish of pain. Add to', '    this that they have the same regard to fame, though they do not expect', '    so great a share as men above them hope for; but I will engage', '    Serjeant Hall would die ten thousand deaths rather than that a word', '    should be spoken at the Red Lettice, or any part of the Butcher Row,', '    in prejudice to his courage or honesty. If you will have my opinion,', \"    then, of the Serjeant's letter, I pronounce the style to be mixed, but\", '    truly epistolary; the sentiment relating to his own wound in the', '    sublime; the postscript of Pegg Hartwell in the gay; and the whole the', '    picture of the bravest sort of men, that is to say, a man of great', '    courage and small hopes.\"[38]', '', 'With such excellences of style and sentiment it is no wonder that the', '_Tatler_ rapidly established itself in public favour. It was a novel', 'experience for the general reader to be provided three times a week with', 'entertainment that pleased his imagination without offending his sense of', 'decency or his religious instincts. But a new hand shortly appeared in the', '_Tatler_, which was destined to carry the art of periodical essay-writing', 'to a perfection beside which even the humour of Steele appears rude and', 'unpolished. Addison and Steele had been friends since boyhood. They had', 'been contemporaries at the Charter House, and, as we have seen, Steele had', \"sometimes spent his holidays in the parsonage of Addison's father. He was\", 'a postmaster at Merton about the same time that his friend was a Fellow of', 'Magdalen. The admiration which he conceived for the hero of his boyhood', 'lasted, as so often happens, through life; he exhibited his veneration for', 'him in all places, and even when Addison indulged his humour at his', 'expense he showed no resentment. Addison, on his side, seems to have', 'treated Steele with a kind of gracious condescension. The latter was one', 'of the few intimate friends to whom he unbent in conversation; and while', 'he was Under-Secretary of State he aided him in the production of _The', 'Tender Husband_, which was dedicated to him by the author. Of this play', 'Steele afterwards declared with characteristic impulse that many of the', 'most admired passages were the work of his friend, and that he \"thought', 'very meanly of himself that he had never publicly avowed it.\"', '', 'The authorship of the _Tatler_ was at first kept secret to all the world.', 'It is said that the hand of Steele discovered itself to Addison on reading', 'in the fifth number a remark which he remembered to have himself made to', 'Steele on the judgment of Virgil, as shown in the appellation of \"Dux', 'Trojanus,\" which the Latin poet assigns to Æneas, when describing his', 'adventure with Dido in the cave, in the place of the usual epithet of', '\"pius\" or \"pater.\" Thereupon he offered his services as a contributor, and', 'these were of course gladly accepted. The first paper sent by Addison to', 'the _Tatler_ was No. 18, wherein is displayed that inimitable art which', 'makes a man appear infinitely ridiculous by the ironical commendation of', 'his offences against right, reason, and good taste. The subject is the', 'approaching peace with France, and it is noticeable that the article of', 'foreign news, which had been treated in previous _Tatlers_ with complete', 'seriousness, is here for the first time invested with an air of', 'pleasantry. The distress of the news-writers at the prospect of peace is', 'thus described:', '', '    \"There is another sort of gentlemen whom I am much more concerned for,', '    and that is the ingenious fraternity of which I have the honour to be', '    an unworthy member; I mean the news-writers of Great Britain, whether', '    Post-men or Post-boys, or by what other name or title soever dignified', '    or distinguished. The case of these gentlemen is, I think, more hard', '    than that of the soldiers, considering that they have taken more towns', '    and fought more battles. They have been upon parties and skirmishes', '    when our armies have lain still, and given the general assault to many', '    a place when the besiegers were quiet in their trenches. They have', '    made us masters of several strong towns many weeks before our generals', '    could do it, and completed victories when our greatest captains have', '    been glad to come off with a drawn battle. Where Prince Eugene has', '    slain his thousands Boyer has slain his ten thousands. This gentleman', '    can indeed be never enough commended for his courage and intrepidity', '    during this whole war: he has laid about him with an inexpressible', '    fury, and, like offended Marius of ancient Rome, made such havoc among', '    his countrymen as must be the work of two or three ages to repair....', '    It is impossible for this ingenious sort of men to subsist after a', '    peace: every one remembers the shifts they were driven to in the reign', '    of King Charles the Second, when they could not furnish out a single', '    paper of news without lighting up a comet in Germany or a fire in', '    Moscow. There scarce appeared a letter without a paragraph on an', '    earthquake. Prodigies were grown so familiar that they had lost their', '    name, as a great poet of that age has it. I remember Mr. Dyer, who is', '    justly looked upon by all the foxhunters in the nation as the greatest', '    statesman our country has produced, was particularly famous for', \"    dealing in whales, in so much that in five months' time (for I had the\", '    curiosity to examine his letters on that occasion) he brought three', '    into the mouth of the river Thames, besides two porpusses and a', '    sturgeon.\"', '', 'The appearance of Addison as a regular contributor to the _Tatler_', 'gradually brought about a revolution in the character of the paper. For', 'some time longer, indeed, articles continued to be dated from the', 'different coffee-houses, but only slight efforts were made to distinguish', \"the materials furnished from White's, Will's, or Isaac's own apartment.\", 'When the hundredth number was reached a fresh address is given at Shere', \"Lane, where the astrologer lived, and henceforward the papers from White's\", \"and Will's grow extremely rare; those from the Grecian may be said to\", \"disappear; and the foreign intelligence, dated from St. James', whenever\", 'it is inserted, which is seldom, is as often as not made the text of a', 'literary disquisition. Allegories become frequent, and the letters sent,', 'or supposed to be sent, to Isaac at his home address furnish the material', 'for many numbers. The Essay, in fact, or that part of the newspaper which', 'goes to form public opinion, preponderates greatly over that portion which', 'is devoted to the report of news. Spence quotes from a Mr. Chute: \"I have', 'heard Sir Richard Steele say that, though he had a greater share in the', '_Tatlers_ than in the _Spectators_, he thought the news article in the', 'first of these was what contributed much to their success.\"[39] Chute,', 'however, seems to speak with a certain grudge against Addison, and the', 'statement ascribed by him to Steele is intrinsically improbable. It is not', 'very likely that, as the proprietor of the _Tatler_, he would have', 'dispensed with any element in it that contributed to its popularity, yet', 'after No. 100 the news articles are seldom found. The truth is that Steele', \"recognised the superiority of Addison's style, and with his usual\", 'quickness accommodated the form of his journal to the genius of the new', 'contributor.', '', '    \"I have only one gentleman,\" says he, in the preface to the _Tatler_,', '    \"who will be nameless, to thank for any frequent assistance to me,', '    which indeed it would have been barbarous in him to have denied to one', '    with whom he has lived in intimacy from childhood, considering the', '    great ease with which he is able to despatch the most entertaining', '    pieces of this nature. This good office he performed with such force', '    of genius, humour, wit, and learning that I fared like a distressed', '    prince who calls in a powerful neighbour to his aid; I was undone by', '    my own auxiliary; when I had once called him in I could not subsist', '    without dependence on him.\"', '', 'With his usual enthusiastic generosity, Steele, in this passage, unduly', 'depreciates his own merits to exalt the genius of his friend. A comparison', 'of the amount of material furnished to the _Tatler_ by Addison and Steele', 'respectively shows that out of 271 numbers the latter contributed 188 and', 'the former only 42. Nor is the disparity in quantity entirely balanced by', \"the superior quality of Addison's papers. Though it was, doubtless, his\", 'fine workmanship and admirable method which carried to perfection the', 'style of writing initiated in the _Tatler_, yet there is scarcely a', 'department of essay-writing developed in the _Spectator_ which does not', 'trace its origin to Steele. It is Steele who first ventures to raise his', 'voice against the prevailing dramatic taste of the age on behalf of the', \"superior morality and art of Shakespeare's plays.\", '', '    \"Of all men living,\" says he, in the eighth _Tatler_, \"I pity players', '    (who must be men of good understanding to be capable of being such)', '    that they are obliged to repeat and assume proper gestures for', '    representing things of which their reason must be ashamed, and which', '    they must disdain their audience for approving. The amendment of these', '    low gratifications is only to be made by people of condition, by', '    encouraging the noble representation of the noble characters drawn by', '    Shakespeare and others, from whence it is impossible to return without', '    strong impressions of honour and humanity. On these occasions distress', '    is laid before us with all its causes and consequences, and our', '    resentment placed according to the merit of the person afflicted.', '    Were dramas of this nature more acceptable to the taste of the town,', '    men who have genius would bend their studies to excel in them.\"', '', 'Steele, too, it was who attacked, with all the vigour of which he was', 'capable, the fashionable vice of gambling. So severe were his comments on', 'this subject in the _Tatler_ that he raised against himself the fierce', 'resentment of the whole community of sharpers, though he was fortunate', 'enough at the same time to enlist the sympathies of the better part of', 'society. \"Lord Forbes,\" says Mr. Nichols, the antiquary, in his notes to', 'the _Tatler_, \"happened to be in company with the two military gentlemen', 'just mentioned\" (Major-General Davenport and Brigadier Bisset) \"in St.', \"James' Coffee-House when two or three well-dressed men, all unknown to his\", 'lordship or his company, came into the room, and in a public, outrageous', 'manner abused Captain Steele as the author of the _Tatler_. One of them,', \"with great audacity and vehemence, swore that he would cut Steele's throat\", \"or teach him better manners. 'In this country,' said Lord Forbes, 'you\", \"will find it easier to cut a purse than to cut a throat.' His brother\", 'officers instantly joined with his lordship and turned the cut-throats out', 'of the coffee-house with every mark of disgrace.\"[40]', '', 'The practice of duelling, also, which had hitherto passed unreproved, was', 'censured by Steele in a series of papers in the _Tatler_, which seemed to', 'have been written on an occasion when, having been forced to fight much', 'against his will, he had the misfortune dangerously to wound his', 'antagonist.[41] The sketches of character studied from life, and the', 'letters from fictitious correspondents, both of which form so noticeable', 'a feature in the _Spectator_, appear roughly, but yet distinctly, drafted', 'in the _Tatler_. Even the papers of literary criticism, afterwards so', 'fully elaborated by Addison, are anticipated by his friend, who may fairly', 'claim the honour to have been the first to speak with adequate respect of', 'the genius of Milton.[42] In a word, whatever was perfected by Addison was', 'begun by Steele; if the one has for ever associated his name with the', '_Spectator_, the other may justly appropriate the credit of the _Tatler_,', 'a work which bears to its successor the same kind of relation that the', 'frescoes of Masaccio bear, in point of dramatic feeling and style, to', 'those of Raphael; the later productions deserving honour for finish of', 'execution, the earlier for priority of invention.', '', 'The _Tatler_ was published till the 2d of January, 1710-11, and was', \"discontinued, according to Steele's own account, because the public had\", 'penetrated his disguise, and he was therefore no longer able to preach', 'with effect in the person of Bickerstaff. It may be doubted whether this', 'was his real motive for abandoning the paper. He had been long known as', 'its conductor; and that his readers had shown no disinclination to listen', 'to him is proved, not only by the large circulation of each number of the', '_Tatler_, but by the extensive sale of the successive volumes of the', 'collected papers at the high price of a guinea apiece. He was, in all', 'probability, led to drop the publication by finding that the political', 'element that the paper contained was a source of embarrassment to him. His', 'sympathies were vehemently Whig; the _Tatler_ from the beginning had', 'celebrated the virtues of Marlborough and his friends, both directly and', 'under cover of fiction; and he had been rewarded for his services with a', 'commissionership of the Stamp-office. When the Whig Ministry fell in', '1710, Harley, setting a just value on the abilities of Steele, left him in', 'the enjoyment of his office and expressed his desire to serve him in any', 'other way. Under these circumstances, Steele no doubt felt it incumbent on', 'him to discontinue a paper which, both from its design and its traditions,', 'would have tempted him into the expression of his political partialities.', '', 'For two months, therefore, \"the censorship of Great Britain,\" as he', 'himself expressed it, \"remained in commission,\" until Addison and he once', 'more returned to discharge the duties of the office in the _Spectator_,', 'the first number of which was published on the 1st of March, 1710-11. The', '_Tatler_ had only been issued three times a week, but the conductors of', 'the new paper were now so confident in their own resources and in the', 'favour of the public that they undertook to bring out one number daily.', \"The new paper at once exhibited the impress of Addison's genius, which had\", 'gradually transformed the character of the _Tatler_ itself. The latter was', 'originally, in every sense of the word, a newspaper, but the Spectator', 'from the first indulged his humour at the expense of the clubs of', 'Quidnuncs.', '', '    \"There is,\" says he, \"another set of men that I must likewise lay a', '    claim to as being altogether unfurnished with ideas till the business', '    and conversation of the day has supplied them. I have often considered', '    these poor souls with an eye of great commiseration when I have heard', '    them asking the first man they have met with whether there was any', '    news stirring, and by that means gathering together materials for', '    thinking. These needy persons do not know what to talk of till about', \"    twelve o'clock in the morning; for by that time they are pretty good\", '    judges of the weather, know which way the wind sets, and whether the', '    Dutch mail be come in. As they lie at the mercy of the first man they', '    meet, and are grave or impertinent all the day long, according to the', '    notions which they have imbibed in the morning, I would earnestly', '    entreat them not to stir out of their chambers till they have read', '    this paper; and do promise them that I will daily instil into them', '    such sound and wholesome sentiments as shall have a good effect on', '    their conversation for the ensuing twelve hours.\"[43]', '', 'For these, and other men of leisure, a kind of paper differing from the', '_Tatler_, which proposed only to retail the various species of gossip in', 'the coffee-houses, was required, and the new entertainment was provided by', 'the original design of an imaginary club, consisting of several ideal', 'types of character grouped round the central figure of the Spectator. They', 'represent considerable classes or sections of the community, and are, as a', 'rule, men of strongly marked opinions, prejudices, and foibles, which', 'furnish inexhaustible matter of comment to the Spectator himself, who', 'delivers the judgments of reason and common-sense. Sir Roger de Coverley,', 'with his simplicity, his high sense of honour, and his old-world', 'reminiscences, reflects the country gentleman of the best kind; Sir Andrew', 'Freeport expresses the opinions of the enterprising, hard-headed, and', 'rather hard-hearted moneyed interest; Captain Sentry speaks for the army;', 'the Templar for the world of taste and learning; the clergyman for', 'theology and philosophy; while Will Honeycomb, the elderly man of fashion,', 'gives the Spectator many opportunities for criticizing the traditions of', 'morality and breeding surviving from the days of the Restoration. Thus,', 'instead of the division of places which determined the arrangement of the', '_Tatler_, the different subjects treated in the _Spectator_ are', 'distributed among a variety of persons: the Templar is substituted for the', \"Grecian Coffee-House and Will's; Will Honeycomb takes the place of\", \"White's; and Captain Sentry, whose appearances are rare, stands for the\", 'more voluminous article on foreign intelligence published in the old', \"periodical, under the head of St. James's. The Spectator himself finds a\", 'natural prototype in Isaac Bickerstaff, but his character is drawn with a', 'far greater finish and delicacy, and is much more essential to the design', 'of the paper which he conducts, than was that of the old astrologer.', '', 'The aim of the Spectator was to establish a rational standard of conduct', 'in morals, manners, art, and literature.', '', '    \"Since,\" says he in one of his early numbers, \"I have raised to myself', '    so great an audience, I shall spare no pains to make their instruction', '    agreeable and their diversion useful. For which reason I shall', '    endeavour to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with', '    morality, that my readers may, if possible, both ways find their', '    account in the speculation of the day. And to the end that their', '    virtue and discretion may not be short, transient, intermitting starts', '    of thought, I have resolved to refresh their memories from day to day', '    till I have recovered them out of that desperate state of vice and', '    folly into which the age has fallen. The mind that lies fallow but a', '    single day sprouts up in follies that are only to be killed by a', '    constant and assiduous culture. It was said of Socrates that he', '    brought Philosophy down from heaven to inhabit among men; and I shall', '    be ambitious to have it said of me that I have brought Philosophy out', '    of closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and', '    assemblies, at tea-tables and in coffee-houses.\"[44]', '', 'Johnson, in his _Life of Addison_, says that the task undertaken in the', '_Spectator_ was \"first attempted by Casa in his book of _Manners_, and', 'Castiglione in his _Courtier_; two books yet celebrated in Italy for', 'purity and elegance, and which, if they are now less read, are neglected', 'only because they have effected that reformation which their authors', 'intended, and their precepts now are no longer wanted.\" He afterwards', 'praises the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_ by saying that they \"adjusted, like', 'Casa, the unsettled practice of daily intercourse by propriety and', 'politeness, and, like La Bruyère, exhibited the characters and manners of', 'the age.\" This commendation scarcely does justice to the work of Addison', 'and Steele. Casa, a man equally distinguished for profligacy and', 'politeness, merely codified in his _Galateo_ the laws of good manners', 'which prevailed in his age. He is the Lord Chesterfield of Italy.', 'Castiglione gives instructions to the young courtier how to behave in such', \"a manner as to make himself agreeable to his prince. La Bruyère's\", 'characters are no doubt the literary models of those which appear in the', '_Spectator_. But La Bruyère merely described what he saw, with admirable', 'wit, urbanity, and scholarship, but without any of the earnestness of a', 'moral reformer. He could never have conceived the character of Sir Roger', 'de Coverley; and, though he was ready enough to satirise the follies of', 'society as an observer from the outside, to bring \"philosophy out of', 'closets and libraries, to dwell in clubs and assemblies,\" was far from', 'being his ambition. He would probably have thought the publication of a', 'newspaper scarcely consistent with his position as a gentleman.', '', 'A very large portion of the _Spectator_ is devoted to reflections on the', 'manners of women. Addison saw clearly how important a part the female sex', 'was destined to play in the formation of English taste and manners.', 'Removed from the pedestal of enthusiastic devotion on which they had been', 'placed during the feudal ages, women were treated under the Restoration as', 'mere playthings and luxuries. As manners became more decent they found', 'themselves secured in their emancipated position but destitute of serious', \"and rational employment. It was Addison's object, therefore, to enlist the\", 'aid of female genius in softening, refining, and moderating the gross and', 'conflicting tastes of a half-civilised society.', '', '    \"There are none,\" he says, \"to whom this paper will be more useful', '    than to the female world. I have often thought there has not been', '    sufficient pains taken in finding out proper employments and', '    diversions for the fair ones. Their amusements seem contrived for', '    them, rather as they are women than as they are reasonable creatures,', '    and are more adapted to the sex than to the species. The toilet is', '    their great scene of business, and the right adjustment of their hair', '    the principal employment of their lives. The sorting of a suit of', \"    ribands is reckoned a very good morning's work; and if they make an\", \"    excursion to a mercer's or a toy shop, so great a fatigue makes them\", '    unfit for anything else all the day after. Their more serious', '    occupations are sewing and embroidery, and their greatest drudgery the', '    preparations of jellies and sweetmeats. This, I say, is the state of', '    ordinary women, though I know there are multitudes of those of a more', '    elevated life and conversation that move in an exalted sphere of', '    knowledge and virtue, that join all the beauties of the mind to the', '    ornaments of dress, and inspire a kind of awe and respect, as well as', '    of love, into their male beholders. I hope to increase the number of', '    these by publishing this daily paper, which I shall always endeavour', '    to make an innocent, if not an improving entertainment, and by that', '    means, at least, divert the minds of my female readers from greater', '    trifles.\"[45]', '', 'To some of the vigorous spirits of the age the mild and social character', \"of the _Spectator's_ satire did not commend itself. Swift, who had\", 'contributed several papers to the _Tatler_ while it was in its infancy,', 'found it too feminine for his taste. \"I will not meddle with the', '_Spectator_,\" says he in his _Journal to Stella_, \"let him _fair sex_ it', 'to the world\\'s end.\" Personal pique, however, may have done as much as a', 'differing taste to depreciate the _Spectator_ in the eyes of the author', 'of the _Tale of a Tub_, for he elsewhere acknowledges its merits. \"The', '_Spectator_,\" he writes to Stella, \"is written by Steele, with Addison\\'s', 'help; it is often very pretty....

It is likewise with much satisfaction that I find some of the', '    most outlying parts of the kingdom alarmed upon this occasion, having', '    received letters to expostulate with me about it from several of my', '    readers of the remotest boroughs of Great Britain.\"[48]', '', 'With how keen an interest the public entered into the humour of the paper', 'is shown by the following letter, signed \"Philo-Spec:\"', '', '    \"I was this morning in a company of your well-wishers, when we read', \"    over, with great satisfaction, Tully's observations on action adapted\", '    to the British theatre, though, by the way, we were very sorry to find', '    that you have disposed of another member of your club. Poor Sir Roger', '    is dead, and the worthy clergyman dying; Captain Sentry has taken', \"    possession of a fair estate; Will Honeycomb has married a farmer's\", '    daughter; and the Templar withdraws himself into the business of his', '    own profession.\"[49]', '', 'It is no wonder that readers anticipated with regret the dissolution of a', 'society that had provided them with so much delicate entertainment.', 'Admirably as the club was designed for maintaining that variety of', 'treatment on which Mr. Trusty comments in the letter quoted above, the', 'execution of the design is deserving of even greater admiration. The skill', 'with which the grave speculations of the _Spectator_ are contrasted with', 'the lively observations of Will Honeycomb on the fashions of the age, and', 'these again are diversified with papers descriptive of character or', 'adorned with fiction, while the letters from the public outside form a', 'running commentary on the conduct of the paper, cannot be justly', 'appreciated without a certain effort of thought. But it may safely be said', 'that, to have provided society day after day, for more than two years,', 'with a species of entertainment which, nearly two centuries later, retains', 'all its old power to interest and delight, is an achievement unique in the', 'history of literature. Even apart from the exquisite art displayed in', 'their grouping, the matter of many of the essays in the _Spectator_ is', 'still valuable. The vivid descriptions of contemporary manners, the', 'inimitable series of sketches of Sir Roger de Coverley, the criticisms in', \"the papers on _True and False Wit_ and Milton's _Paradise Lost_, have\", 'scarcely less significance for ourselves than for the society for which', 'they were immediately written.', '', \"Addison's own papers were 274 in number, as against 236 contributed by\", 'Steele.

The pension granted him by', 'Halifax enabled him, while he was yet a young man, to add to his knowledge', 'of classical literature an intimate acquaintance with the languages and', 'governments of the chief European states. When his fortunes were at the', 'lowest ebb on his return from his travels, his introduction to Godolphin', 'by Halifax, the consequence of which was _The Campaign_, procured him at', 'once celebrity and advancement. The appearance of the _Tatler_, though due', 'entirely to the invention of Steele, prepared the way for development of', \"the genius that prevailed in the _Spectator_. But the climax of Addison's\", 'good fortune was certainly the successful production of _Cato_, a play', 'which, on its own merits, might have been read with interest by the', 'scholars of the time, but which could scarcely have succeeded on the stage', 'if it had not been appropriated and made part of our national life by the', 'violence of political passion.', '', 'Addison had not the genius of a dramatist. The grace, the irony, the', 'fastidious refinement which give him such an unrivalled capacity in', 'describing and criticising the humours of men as a _spectator_ did not', 'qualify him for imaginative sympathy with their actions and passions. But,', 'like most men of ability in that period, his thoughts were drawn towards', \"the stage, and even in Dryden's lifetime he had sent him a play in\", 'manuscript, asking him to use his interest to obtain its performance. The', 'old poet returned it, we are told, \"with many commendations, but with an', 'expression of his opinion that on the stage it would not meet with its', 'deserved success.\" Addison, nevertheless, persevered in his attempts, and', 'during his travels he wrote four acts of the tragedy of _Cato_, the design', 'of which, according to Tickell, he had formed while he was at Oxford,', 'though he certainly borrowed many incidents in the play from a tragedy on', 'the same subject which he saw performed at Venice.[52] It is', 'characteristic, however, of the undramatic mood in which he executed his', 'task that the last act was not written till shortly before the performance', 'of the play, many years later. As early as 1703 the drama was shown to', 'Cibber by Steele, who said that \"whatever spirit Mr. Addison had shown in', 'his writing it, he doubted that he would ever have courage enough to let', 'his _Cato_ stand the censure of an English audience; that it had only been', 'the amusement of his leisure hours in Italy, and was never intended for', 'the stage.\" He seems to have remained of the same opinion on the very eve', 'of the performance of the play. \"When Mr. Addison,\" says Pope, as reported', 'by Spence, \"had finished his _Cato_ he brought it to me, desired to have', 'my sincere opinion of it, and left it with me for three or four days. I', \"gave him my opinion of it sincerely, which was, 'that I thought he had\", 'better not act it, and that he would get reputation enough by only', \"printing it.' This I said as thinking the lines well written, but the\", \"piece not theatrical enough. Some time after Mr. Addison said 'that his\", 'own opinion was the same with mine, but that some particular friends of', 'his, whom he could not disoblige, insisted on its being acted.\\'\"[53]', '', 'Undoubtedly, Pope was right in principle, and anybody who reads the', 'thirty-ninth paper in the _Spectator_ may see not only that Addison was', 'out of sympathy with the traditions of the English stage, but that his', 'whole turn of thought disqualified him from comprehending the motives of', 'dramatic composition. \"The modern drama,\" says he, \"excels that of Greece', 'and Rome in the intricacy and disposition of the fable--but, what a', 'Christian writer would be ashamed to own, falls infinitely short of it in', 'the moral part of the performance.\" And the entire drift of the criticism', 'that follows relates to the thought, the sentiment, and the expression of', 'the modern drama, rather than to the really essential question, the nature', 'of the action. It is false criticism to say that the greatest dramas of', 'Shakespeare fail in morality as compared with those of the Greek', 'tragedians. That the manner in which the moral is conveyed is different in', 'each case is of course true, since the subjects of Greek tragedy were', 'selected from Greek mythology, and were treated by Æschylus and Sophocles,', 'at all events, in a religious spirit, whereas the plays of Shakespeare are', 'only indirectly Christian, and produce their effect by an appeal to the', 'individual conscience. None the less is it the case that _Macbeth_,', '_Hamlet_, and _Lear_ have for modern audiences a far deeper moral meaning', 'than the _Agamemnon_ or the _Oedipus Tyrannus_. The tragic motive in Greek', 'tragedy is the impotence of man in the face of moral law or necessity; in', \"Shakespeare's tragedies it is the corruption of the will, some sin of the\", 'individual against the law of God, which brings its own punishment. There', 'was nothing in this principle of which a Christian dramatist need have', 'been ashamed; and as regards Shakespeare, at any rate, it is evident that', \"Addison's criticism is unjust.\", '', 'It is, however, by no means undeserved in its application to the class of', 'plays which grew up after the Restoration. Under that _régime_ the moral', 'spirit of the Shakesperian drama entirely disappears. The king, whose', 'temper was averse to tragedy, and whose taste had been formed on French', 'models, desired to see every play end happily. \"I am going to end a', 'piece,\" writes Roger, Earl of Orrery, to a friend, \"in the French style,', 'because I have heard the King declare that he preferred their manner to', 'our own.\" The greatest tragedies of the Elizabethan age were transformed', 'to suit this new fashion; even King Lear obtained a happy deliverance from', 'his sufferings in satisfaction of the requirements of an effeminate Court.', 'Addison very wittily ridicules this false taste in the fortieth number of', 'the _Spectator_. He is not less felicitous in his remarks on the', 'sentiments and the style of the Caroline drama, though he does not', 'sufficiently discriminate his censure, which he bestows equally on the', 'dramatists of the Restoration and on Shakespeare. Two main characteristics', 'appear in all the productions of the former epoch--the monarchical spirit', 'and the fashion of gallantry. The names of the plays speak for themselves:', 'on the one hand, _The Indian Emperor_, _Aurengzebe_, _The Indian Queen_,', '_The Conquest of Granada_, _The Fate of Hannibal_; on the other, _Secret', 'Love_, _Tyrannic Love_, _Love and Vengeance_, _The Rival Queens_,', '_Theodosius, or the Power of Love_, and numberless others of the same', 'kind. In the one set of dramas the poet sought to arouse the passion of', 'pity by exhibiting the downfall of persons of high estate; in the other', 'he appealed to the sentiment of romantic passion. Such were the fruits of', 'that taste for French romance which was encouraged by Charles II., and', 'which sought to disguise the absence of genuine emotion by the turgid', 'bombast of its sentiment and the epigrammatic declamation of its rhymed', 'verse.', '', 'At the same time, the taste of the nation having been once turned into', 'French channels, a remedy for these defects was naturally sought for from', 'French sources; and just as the school of Racine and Boileau set its face', 'against the extravagances of the romantic coteries, so Addison and his', 'English followers, adopting the principles of the French classicists,', 'applied them to the reformation of the English theatre. Hence arose a', 'great revival of respect for the poetical doctrines of Aristotle, regard', 'for the unities of time and place, attention to the proprieties of', 'sentiment and diction--in a word, for all those characteristics of style', 'afterwards summed up in the phrase \"correctness.\"', '', 'This habit of thought, useful as an antidote to extravagance, was not', 'fertile as a motive of dramatic production. Addison worked with strict and', 'conscious attention to his critical principles: the consequence is that', 'his _Cato_, though superficially \"correct,\" is a passionless and', 'mechanical play. He had combated with reason the \"ridiculous doctrine in', 'modern criticism, that writers of tragedy are obliged to an equal', 'distribution of rewards and punishments, and an impartial execution of', 'poetical justice.\"[54] But his reasoning led him on to deny that the idea', 'of justice is an essential element in tragedy. \"We find,\" says he, \"that', 'good and evil happen alike to all men on this side the grave; and, as the', 'principal design of tragedy is to raise commiseration and terror in the', 'minds of the audience, we shall defeat this great end if we always make', 'virtue and innocence happy and successful.... The ancient writers of', 'tragedy treated men in their plays as they are dealt with in the world, by', 'making virtue sometimes happy and sometimes miserable, as they found it in', 'the fable which they made choice of, or as it might affect their audience', 'in the most agreeable manner.\"[55] But it is certain that the fable which', 'the two greatest of the Greek tragedians \"made choice of\" was always of a', 'religious nature, and that the idea of Justice was never absent from it;', 'it is also certain that Retribution is a vital element in all the', 'tragedies of Shakespeare. The notion that the essence of tragedy consists', 'in the spectacle of a good man struggling with adversity is a conception', 'derived through the French from the Roman Stoics; it is not found in the', 'works of the greatest tragic poets.', '', \"This, however, was Addison's central motive, and this is what Pope, in his\", 'famous Prologue, assigns to him as his chief praise:', '', '  \"Our author shuns by vulgar springs to move', \"  The hero's glory or the virgin's love;\", '  In pitying love we but our weakness show,', '  And wild ambition well deserves its woe.', '  Here tears shall flow from a more generous cause,', '  Such tears as patriots shed for dying laws:', '  He bids your breasts with ancient ardour rise,', '  And calls forth Roman drops from British eyes.', '  Virtue confessed in human shape he draws--', '  What Plato thought, and godlike Cato was:', '  No common object to your sight displays,', \"  But what with pleasure heav'n itself surveys;\", '  A brave man struggling in the storms of fate,', '  And greatly falling with a falling state.\"', '', 'A falling state offers a tragic spectacle to the thought and the reason,', 'but not one that can be represented on the stage so as to move the', 'passions of the spectators. The character of Cato, as exhibited by', 'Addison, is an abstraction, round which a number of other lay figures are', 'skilfully grouped for the delivery of lofty and appropriate sentiments.', \"Juba, the virtuous young prince of Numidia, the admirer of Cato's virtue,\", \"Portius and Marcus, Cato's virtuous sons, and Marcia, his virtuous\", \"daughter, are all equally admirable and equally lifeless. Johnson's\", 'criticism of the play leaves little to be said:', '', '    \"About things,\" he observes, \"on which the public thinks long it', '    commonly attains to think right; and of _Cato_ it has not been', '    unjustly determined that it is rather a poem in dialogue than a drama,', '    rather a succession of just sentiments in elegant language than a', '    representation of natural affections, or of any state probable or', \"    possible in human life. Nothing here 'excites or assuages emotion;'\", \"    here is 'no magical power of raising fantastic terror or wild\", \"    anxiety.' The events are expected without solicitude, and are\", '    remembered without joy or sorrow. Of the agents we have no care; we', '    consider not what they are doing or what they are suffering; we wish', '    only to know what they have to say. Cato is a being above our', '    solicitude; a man of whom the gods take care, and whom we leave to', '    their care with heedless confidence. To the rest neither gods nor men', '    can have much attention, for there is not one among them that strongly', '    attracts either affection or esteem. But they are made the vehicles of', '    such sentiments and such expressions that there is scarcely a scene in', '    the play which the reader does not wish to impress upon his memory.\"', '', 'To this it may be added that, from the essentially undramatic bent of', \"Addison's genius, whenever he contrives a train of incident he manages to\", 'make it a little absurd. Dennis has pointed out with considerable humour', 'the consequences of his conscientious adherence to the unity of place,', 'whereby every species of action in the play--love-making, conspiracy,', 'debating, and fighting--is made to take place in the \"large hall in the', 'governor\\'s palace of Utica.\" It is strange that Addison\\'s keen sense of', 'the ridiculous, which inspired so happily his criticisms on the', 'allegorical paintings at Versailles,[56] should not have shown him the', 'incongruities which Dennis discerned; but, in truth, they pervade the', 'atmosphere of the whole play. All the actors--the distracted lovers, the', 'good young man, Juba, and the blundering conspirator, Sempronius--seem to', 'be oppressed with an uneasy consciousness that they have a character to', 'sustain, and are not confident of coming up to what is expected of them.', 'This is especially the case with Portius, a pragmatic young Roman, whose', 'praiseworthy but futile attempts to unite the qualities of Stoical', 'fortitude, romantic passion, and fraternal loyalty, exhibit him in a', 'position of almost comic embarrassment. According to Pope, \"the love part', 'was flung in after, to comply with the popular taste;\" but the removal of', 'these scenes would make the play so remarkably barren of incident that it', 'is a little difficult to credit the statement.', '', 'The deficiencies of _Cato_ as an acting play were, however, more than', 'counterbalanced by the violence of party spirit, which insisted on', 'investing the comparatively tame sentiments assigned to the Roman', 'champions of liberty with a pointed modern application. In 1713 the rage', 'of the contending factions was at its highest point. The Tories were', 'suspected, not without reason, of designs against the Act of Settlement;', 'the Whigs, on the other hand, were still suffering in public opinion from', 'the charge of having, for their own advantage, protracted the war with', 'Louis XIV. Marlborough had been accused in 1711 of receiving bribes while', 'commander-in-chief, and had been dismissed from all his employments.', 'Disappointment, envy, revenge, and no doubt a genuine apprehension for the', 'public safety, inspired the attacks of the Whigs upon their rivals; and', 'when it was known that Addison had in his drawers an unfinished play on so', 'promising a subject as _Cato_, great pressure was put upon him by his', 'friends to complete it for the stage. Somewhat unwillingly, apparently, he', 'roused himself to the task. So small, indeed, was his inclination for it,', 'that he is said in the first instance to have asked Hughes, afterwards', 'author of the _Siege of Damascus_, to write a fifth act for him. Hughes', 'undertook to do so, but on returning a few days afterwards with his own', 'performance, he found that Addison had himself finished the play. In spite', 'of the judgment of the critics, _Cato_ was quickly hurried off for', 'rehearsal, doubtless with many fears on the part of the author. His', 'anxieties during this period must have been great. \"I was this morning,\"', 'writes Swift to Stella on the 6th of April, \"at ten, at the rehearsal of', \"Mr. Addison's play, called _Cato_, which is to be acted on Friday.

This was the case, too,', '    with the Prologue-writer, who was clapped into a staunch Whig at the', '    end of every two lines. I believe you have heard that, after all the', '    applauses of the opposite faction, my Lord Bolingbroke sent for Booth,', '    who played Cato, into the box, between one of the acts, and presented', '    him with fifty guineas, in acknowledgment, as he expressed it, for', '    defending the cause of liberty so well against a perpetual dictator.', '    The Whigs are unwilling to be distanced this way, and therefore design', '    a present to the same Cato very speedily; in the meantime they are', '    getting ready as good a sentence as the former on their side; so', '    betwixt them it is probable that Cato (as Dr. Garth expressed it) may', '    have something to live upon after he dies.\"', '', 'The Queen herself partook, or feigned to partake, of the general', 'enthusiasm, and expressed a wish that the play should be dedicated to her.', 'This honour had, however, been already designed by the poet for the', 'Duchess of Marlborough, so that, finding himself unable under the', 'circumstances to fulfil his intentions, he decided to leave the play', 'without any dedication. _Cato_ ran for the then unprecedented period of', 'thirty-five nights. Addison appears to have behaved with great liberality', 'to the actors, and, at Oxford, to have handed over to them all the profits', \"of the first night's performance; while they in return, Cibber tells us,\", 'thought themselves \"obliged to spare no pains in the proper decorations\"', 'of the piece.', '', 'The fame of _Cato_ spread from England to the Continent.

In confirmation of his evidence, and in proof of his own good', 'feeling for and open dealing with Addison, he inserted in the so-called', 'authorised edition of his correspondence in 1737 several letters written', 'apparently to Addison, while in what he pretended to be the surreptitious', 'edition of 1735 appeared a letter to Craggs, written in July, 1715, which,', 'as it contained many of the phrases and expressions used in the character', 'of Atticus, created an impression in the mind of the public that both', 'letter and verses were written about the same time. No suspicion as to the', 'genuineness of this correspondence was raised till the discovery of the', 'Caryll letters, which first revealed the fact that most of the pretended', 'letters to Addison had been really addressed to Caryll; that there had', 'been, in fact, no correspondence between Pope and Addison; and that,', 'therefore, in all probability, the letter to Craggs was also a fictitious', 'composition, inserted in the so-called surreptitious volume of 1735 to', \"establish the credit of Pope's own story.\", '', \"We must accordingly put aside, as undeserving of credence, the poet's\", 'ingeniously constructed charge, at any rate in the particular shape in', 'which it is preferred, and must endeavour to form for ourselves such a', 'judgment as is rendered probable by the acknowledged facts of the case.', 'What is indisputable is that in 1715 a rupture took place between Addison', 'and Pope, in consequence of the injury which the translator of the _Iliad_', \"conceived himself to have suffered from the countenance given to Tickell's\", 'rival performance; and that in 1723 we find the first mention of the', 'satire upon Addison in a letter from Atterbury to Pope. The question is,', 'what blame attaches to Addison for his conduct in the matter of the two', \"translations; and what is the amount of truth in Pope's story respecting\", 'the composition of the verses on Atticus.', '', \"Pope made Addison's acquaintance in the year 1712. On the 20th of\", \"December, 1711, Addison had noticed Pope's _Art of Criticism_ in the 253d\", 'number of the _Spectator_--partly, no doubt, in consequence of his', 'perception of the merits of the poem, but probably at the particular', 'instigation of Steele, whose acquaintance with Pope may have been due to', 'the common friendship of both with Caryll. The praise bestowed on the', '_Essay_ (as it was afterwards called) was of the finest and most liberal', 'kind, and was the more welcome because it was preceded by a censure', 'conveyed with admirable delicacy on \"the strokes of ill-nature\" which the', 'poem contained. Pope was naturally exceedingly pleased, and wrote to', 'Steele a letter of thanks under the impression that the latter was the', 'writer of the paper, a misapprehension which Steele at once hastened to', 'correct. \"The paper,\" says he, \"was written by one with whom I will make', 'you acquainted--which is the best return I can make to you for your', 'favour.\"', '', 'These words were doubtless used by Steele in the warmth of his affection', 'for Addison, but they also express the general estimation in which the', 'latter was then held. He had recently established his man Button in a', 'coffee-house in Covent Garden, where, surrounded by his little senate,', 'Budgell, Tickell, Carey, and Philips, he ruled supreme over the world of', 'taste and letters. Something, no doubt, of the spirit of the coterie', 'pervaded the select assembly. Addison could always find a word of', 'condescending praise for his followers in the pages of the _Spectator_; he', 'corrected their plays and mended their prologues; and they on their side', 'paid back their patron with unbounded reverence, perhaps justifying the', 'satirical allusion of the poet to the \"applause\" so grateful to the ear of', 'Atticus:', '', '  \"While wits and Templars every sentence raise,', '  And wonder with a foolish face of praise.\"', '', 'Pope, according to his own account, was admitted to the society, and left', 'it, as he said, because he found it sit too far into the night for his', 'health. It may, however, be suspected that the natures of the author of', 'the _Dunciad_ and of the creator of Sir Roger de Coverley, though touching', 'each other at many points, were far from naturally congenial; that the', 'essayist was well aware that the man who could write the _Essay on', 'Criticism_ had a higher capacity for poetry than either himself or any of', 'his followers; and that the poet, on his side, conscious of great if', 'undeveloped powers, was inclined to resent the air of patronage with which', \"he was treated by the King of Button's. Certain it is that the praise of\", 'Pope by Addison in number 253 of the _Spectator_ is qualified (though by', 'no means unjustly), and that he is not spoken of with the same warmth as', 'Tickell and Ambrose Philips in number 523. \"Addison,\" said Pope to Spence,', '\"seemed to value himself more upon his poetry than upon his prose, though', 'he wrote the latter with such particular ease, fluency, and', 'happiness.\"[62] This often happens; and perhaps the uneasy consciousness', 'that, in spite of the reputation which his _Campaign_ had secured for him,', 'he was really inferior to such men as John Philips and Tickell, made', 'Addison touchy at the idea of the entire circle being outshone by a new', 'candidate for poetical fame.', '', 'Whatever jealousy, however, existed between the two was carefully', 'suppressed during the first year of their acquaintance. Pope showed', 'Addison the first draft of the _Rape of the Lock_, and, according to', 'Warburton (whose account must be received with suspicion), imparted to him', 'his design of adding the fairy machinery. If Addison really endeavoured to', 'dissuade the poet from making this exquisite addition, the latter was on', 'his side anxious that _Cato_, which, as has been said, was shown to him', 'after its completion, should not be presented on the stage; and his', 'advice, if tested by the result, would have been quite as open as', \"Addison's to an unfavourable construction. He wrote, however, for the play\", 'the famous Prologue which Steele inserted, with many compliments, in the', '_Guardian_. But not long afterwards the effect of the compliments was', \"spoiled by the comparatively cold mention of Pope's _Pastorals_ in the\", 'same paper that contained a glowing panegyric on the _Pastorals_ of', \"Ambrose Philips. In revenge, Pope wrote his paper commending Philips'\", 'performance and depreciating his own, the irony of which, it is said,', 'escaping the notice of Steele, was inserted by him in the _Guardian_, much', 'to the amusement of Addison and more to the disgust of Philips.', '', \"The occasion on which Pope's pique against Addison began to develop into\", 'bitter resentment is sufficiently indicated by the date which the poet', 'assigns to the first letter in the concocted correspondence--viz., July', '20, 1713. This letter (which is taken, with a few slight alterations of', 'names, from one written to Caryll on November 19, 1712) opens as follows:', '', '    \"I am more joyed at your return than I should be at that of the sun,', '    so much as I wish for him this melancholy wet season; but it has a', '    fate too like yours to be displeasing to owls and obscure animals who', '    cannot bear his lustre.

Addison doubtless divined the', 'truth; but the wording of the letter which he caused a third person to', 'write to Lintot certainly seems studiously offensive to Pope, who had,', 'professedly at any rate, placed his pen at his service, and who had', 'connected his own name with _Cato_ by the fine Prologue he had written in', \"its praise. Lintot would of course have shown Pope Steele's letter, and we\", 'may be sure that the lofty tone taken by Addison in speaking of the', \"pamphlet would have rankled bitterly in the poet's mind.\", '', 'At the same time Philips, who was naturally enraged with Pope on account', 'of the ridicule with which the latter had covered his _Pastorals_,', 'endeavoured to widen the breach by spreading a report that Pope had', 'entered into a conspiracy to write against the Whigs, and to undermine the', 'reputation of Addison. Addison seems to have lent a ready ear to these', 'accusations. At any rate Pope thought so; for when the good-natured', 'painter Jervas sought to bring about a composition, he wrote to him (27th', 'August, 1714):', '', '    \"What you mentioned of the friendly office you endeavoured to do', '    betwixt Mr. Addison and me deserves acknowledgment on my part. You', '    thoroughly know my regard to his character, and my propensity to', '    testify it by all ways in my power. You as thoroughly know the', '    scandalous meanness of that proceeding, which was used by Philips, to', '    make a man I so highly value suspect my disposition towards him. But', '    as, after all, Mr. Addison must be the judge in what regards himself,', '    and has seemed to be no very just one to me, so I must own to you I', '    expect nothing but civility from him, how much soever I wish for his', '    friendship. As for any offices of real kindness or service which it is', '    in his power to do me, I should be ashamed to receive them from any', '    man who had no better opinion of my morals than to think me a party', '    man, nor of my temper than to believe me capable of maligning or', \"    envying another's reputation as a poet. So I leave it to time to\", '    convince him as to both, to show him the shallow depths of those', '    half-witted creatures who misinformed him, and to prove that I am', '    incapable of endeavouring to lessen a person whom I would be proud to', '    imitate, and therefore ashamed to flatter. In a word, Mr. Addison is', '    sure of my respect at all times, and of my real friendship whenever he', '    shall think fit to know me for what I am.\"', '', 'It is evident, from the tone of this letter, that all the materials for a', 'violent quarrel were in existence. On the one side was Addison, with', \"probably an instinctive dislike of Pope's character, intensified by the\", 'injurious reports circulated against Pope in the \"little senate\" at', \"Button's; with a nature somewhat cold and reserved; and with something of\", 'literary jealousy, partly arising from a sense of what was due to his', 'acknowledged supremacy, and partly from a perception that there had', 'appeared a very formidable \"brother near the throne.\" On the side of Pope', 'there was an eager sensitiveness, ever craving for recognition and praise,', 'with an abnormal irritability prone to watch for, and reluctant to', 'forgive, anything in the shape of a slight or an injury. Slights and', 'injuries he already deemed himself to have received, and accordingly, when', 'Tickell, in 1715, published his translation of the First Book of the', '_Iliad_ at the same time with his own translation of the first four books,', 'his smothered resentment broke into a blaze at what he imagined to be a', 'conspiracy to damage his poetical reputation. Many years afterwards, when', 'the quarrel between Addison and himself had become notorious, he arranged', 'his version of it for the public in a manner which is, indeed, far from', 'assisting us to a knowledge of the truth, but which enables us to', 'understand very clearly what was passing in his own mind at the time.', '', \"The subscription for Pope's translation of the _Iliad_ was set on foot in\", 'November, 1713.

We went', \"    accordingly, and after dinner Mr. Addison said 'that he had wanted for\", '    some time to talk with me: that his friend Tickell had formerly, while', '    at Oxford, translated the first book of the _Iliad_. That he now', '    designed to print it, and had desired him to look it over: he must', '    therefore beg that I would not desire him to look over my first book,', \"    because, if he did, it would have the air of double dealing.'

I then added 'that I would not desire him to\", '    look over my first book of the _Iliad_, because he had looked over Mr.', \"    Tickell's, but could wish to have the benefit of his observations on\", '    my second, which I had then finished, and which Mr. Tickell had not', \"    touched upon.' Accordingly, I sent him the second book the next\", '    morning; and in a few days he returned it with very high commendation.', '    Soon after it was generally known that Mr. Tickell was publishing the', '    first book of the _Iliad_ I met Dr. Young in the street, and, upon our', '    falling into that subject, the doctor expressed a great deal of', \"    surprise at Tickell's having such a translation by him so long. He\", '    said that it was inconceivable to him, and that there must be some', '    mistake in the matter; that he and Tickell were so intimately', '    acquainted at Oxford that each used to communicate to the other', '    whatever verses they wrote, even to the least things; that Tickell', '    could not have been busied in so long a work there without his knowing', '    something of the matter; and that he had never heard a single word of', '    it till this occasion.\"[64]', '', 'It is scarcely necessary to say that, after the light that has been', \"thrown on Pope's character by the detection of the frauds he practised in\", 'the publication of his correspondence, it is impossible to give any', \"credence to the tales he poured into Spence's ear, tending to blacken\", \"Addison's character and to exalt his own. Tickell's MS. of the translation\", 'is in existence, and all the evidence tends to show that he was really the', 'author of it. But the above statement may be taken to reflect accurately', \"enough the rage, the resentment, and the suspicion which disturbed Pope's\", 'own mind on the appearance of the rival translation. We can scarcely doubt', 'that it was this, and this alone, which roused him to such glowing', 'indignation and inspired him to write the character of Atticus. When the', \"verses were made public, after Addison's death, he probably perceived that\", \"the public would not consider the evidence for Addison's collusion with\", 'Tickell to be sufficiently strong to afford a justification for the', 'bitterness of the satire. It was necessary to advance some stronger plea', 'for such retaliation, especially as rumour confidently asserted that the', 'lines had not been written till after Addison was dead. Hence the story', 'told by Pope to Spence, proving first that the lines were not only written', \"during Addison's lifetime, but were actually sent to Addison himself; and\", 'secondly, that they were only composed after the strongest evidence had', \"been afforded to the poet of his rival's malignant disposition towards\", 'him. Hence, too, the publication in 1735 of the letter to Craggs, which,', 'containing as it did many of the phrases and metaphors employed in the', 'verses, seemed to supply indirect evidence that both were written about', 'the same period.', '', \"With regard to Pope's story, it is not too much to say that it entirely\", 'breaks down on examination. He professes to give it on the authority of', 'Lord Warwick himself, reckoning, of course, that the evidence of', \"Addison's own step-son would be conclusive with the public. But Addison\", 'was not married to the Countess of Warwick till August, 1716; and in the', \"previous May he had bestowed the most liberal praise on Pope's translation\", 'in one of his papers in the _Freeholder_. For Lord Warwick, therefore, to', 'argue at that date that Addison\\'s \"_jealous temper_ could never admit of a', 'settled friendship\" between him and Pope was out of the question. If, on', \"the other hand, Lord Warwick told his story to Pope before his mother's\", 'marriage, the difficulty is equally great. The letter to Craggs, which, if', 'it was ever sent to the latter at all, must obviously have been written in', 'the same \"heat\" which prompted the satire on Atticus, is dated July 15,', '1715. This fits in well enough with the date of the dispute about the', \"rival translations of the _Iliad_, but not with Lord Warwick's story, for\", 'Wycherley, after whose death Gildon, we are told, was hired by Addison to', 'abuse Pope, did not die till the December of that year.', '', 'Again, the internal evidence of the character itself points to the fact', 'that, when it was first composed, its \"heat\" was not caused by any', 'information the poet had received of a transaction between Addison and', 'Gildon. The following is the first published version of the satire:', '', '  \"If Dennis writes and rails in furious pet', \"  I'll answer Dennis when I am in debt.\", '  If meagre Gildon draw his meaner quill,', '  I wish the man a dinner and sit still.', '  But should there _One_ whose better stars conspire', '  To form a bard, and raise a genius higher,', '  Blest with each talent and each art to please,', '  And born to live, converse, and write with ease;', '  Should such a one, resolved to reign alone,', '  Bear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne,', '  View him with jealous yet with scornful eyes,', '  Hate him for arts that caused himself to rise,', '  Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer,', '  And without sneering teach the rest to sneer;', '  Alike reserved to blame or to commend,', '  A timorous foe and a suspicious friend,', \"  Fearing e'en fools, by flatterers besieged,\", \"  And so obliging that he ne'er obliged;\", '  Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike,', '  Just hint the fault, and hesitate dislike,', '  _Who when two wits on rival themes contest,', '  Approves of both, but likes the worst the best_:', '  Like Cato, give his little senate laws', '  And sits attentive to his own applause;', '  While wits and templars every sentence praise', '  And wonder with a foolish face of praise:', '  Who would not laugh if such a man there be?', '  Who would not weep if Addison were he?\"', '', 'There is sufficient corroborative evidence to allow us to believe that', \"these lines were actually written, as Pope says, during Addison's\", 'lifetime; and if they were, the character of the satire would naturally', \"suggest that its motive was Addison's supposed conduct in the matter of\", 'the two translations of the _Iliad_. There is nothing in them to indicate', \"any connection in the poet's mind between Gildon and Addison; on the other\", 'hand, the allusion to the \"two wits\" shows the special grievance that', 'formed the basis, in his imagination, of the whole character. Afterwards', 'we find that \"meaner quill\" is replaced by \"_venal_ quill;\" and the', 'couplet about the rival translations is suppressed. The inference is', 'plain. When Pope was charged with having written the character after', \"Addison's death, he found himself obliged, in self-defence, to furnish a\", 'moral justification for the satire; and, after his own unfortunate manner,', 'he proceeded to build up for himself a position on a number of systematic', 'falsehoods. His story was probably so far true that the character was', 'really written while Addison was alive; on the other hand, it is not', 'unreasonable to conclude that the entire statement about Gildon and Lord', 'Warwick is fabulous; and, as the assertion that the lines were sent to', 'Addison immediately after their composition is associated with these', 'myths, this, too, may fairly be dismissed as equally undeserving of', 'belief.', '', 'As to the truth of the character of Atticus, however, it by no means', \"follows, because Pope's account of its origin is false, that the portrait\", 'itself is altogether untrue. The partizans of Addison endeavour to prove', 'that it is throughout malicious and unjust. But no one can fail to', 'perceive that the character itself is a very extraordinary picture of', 'human nature; and there is no reason to suppose that Addison was superior', 'to the weaknesses of his kind. On the contrary, there is independent', 'evidence to show that he was strongly influenced by that literary jealousy', 'which makes the groundwork of the ideal character. This the piercing', 'intelligence of Pope no doubt plainly discerned; his inflamed imagination', 'built up on this foundation the wonderful fabric that has ever since', 'continued to enchant the world. The reader who is acquainted with his own', 'heart will probably not find much difficulty in determining what elements', 'in the character are derived from the substantial truth of nature, and', 'what are to be ascribed to the exaggerated perceptions of Genius.', '', '', '', '']\n",

The most salient of these was, perhaps, the alleged sacrifice', 'of British commercial interests through the incompetence or corruption of', 'the negotiators, and on this question the Whigs accordingly raised', 'vehement and reiterated debates. Addison aided his political friends with', 'an ingenious pamphlet on the subject, called _The late Trial and', 'Conviction of Count Tariff_, containing a narrative of the lawsuit between', 'the Count and Goodman Fact, which is written with much spirit and', 'pleasantry. It is said that he also took the field in answer to the', 'Address to the Queen from the magistrates of Dunkirk, wherein Her Majesty', 'was requested to waive the execution of the article in the Treaty', 'providing for the demolition of the harbour and fortifications of that', 'town; but if he wrote on the subject the pamphlet has not been preserved', 'by Tickell.

It', 'could count, no doubt, on the loyalty of a House of Commons elected when', 'the Tories were momentarily stunned by the death of Queen Anne, on the', 'faith of the army, and on the support of the moneyed interest. On the', 'other hand, the two most important classes in the kingdom--the landed', 'proprietors and the clergy--were generally hostile to the new _régime_,', 'and the influence exercised by the latter was of course exceedingly great', 'in days when the pulpit was still the chief instrument in the formation of', 'public opinion. The weight of some powerful writer was urgently needed on', 'the Whig side, and Addison--who in the preceding August had been obliged', 'to vacate his office of Secretary in consequence of the resignation of the', 'Lord-Lieutenant--was by common consent indicated as the man best qualified', 'for the task. There were indeed hot political partizans who questioned his', 'capacity. Steele said that \"the Government had made choice of a lute when', 'they ought to have taken a trumpet.\" But if by the \"trumpet\" he was', 'modestly alluding to himself, it may very well be doubted if the objects', 'of the Government would have been attained by employing the services of', 'the author of the _Englishman_. What was wanted was not party invective,', 'but the calm persuasiveness of reason; a pen that could _prove_ to all', 'Tory country gentlemen and thoroughgoing High Churchmen that the', 'Protestant succession was indispensable to the safety of the principles', 'which each respectively considered to be of vital importance. This was the', 'task which lay before Addison, and which he accomplished with consummate', 'skill in the _Freeholder_.', '', 'The name of the new paper was selected by him in order to suggest that', 'property was the basis of liberty; and his main argument, which he', 'introduces under constantly varying forms, is that there could be no', 'safety for property under a line of monarchs who claimed the dispensing', 'power, and no security for the liberties of the Church under kings of an', 'alien religion. In order to secure variety of treatment, the exact social', 'position of the _Freeholder_ is not defined:', '', '    \"At the same time that I declare I am a freeholder I do not exclude', '    myself from any other title. A freeholder may be either a voter or a', '    knight of the shire, a wit or a fox-hunter, a scholar or a soldier, an', '    alderman or a courtier, a patriot or a stock-jobber. But I choose to', '    be distinguished by this denomination, as the freeholder is the basis', '    of all other titles. Dignities may be grafted upon it, but this is the', '    substantial stock that conveys to them their life, taste, and beauty,', '    and without which they are blossoms that would fall away with every', '    shake of wind.\"[66]', '', 'By this means he was able to impart liveliness to his theme, which he', 'diversifies by philosophical disquisition; by good-natured satire on the', 'prejudices of the country gentlemen; by frequent papers on his favourite', 'subject, \"the fair sex;\" and by occasional glances at literature. Though', 'his avowed object was to prove the superiority of the Whig over the Tory', 'theory of the Constitution, his \"native moderation\" never deserts him, and', 'he often lets his disgust at the stupidity of faction, and his preference', 'for social over political writing, appear in the midst of his argument.', 'The best papers in the series are undoubtedly the \"Memoirs of a Preston', 'Rebel\" and the \"Tory Foxhunter,\" both of which are full of the exquisite', 'humour that distinguishes the sketches of Sir Roger de Coverley. The', '_Freeholder_ was only continued for six months (December 23, 1715, to June', '9, 1716), being published every Friday and Monday, and being completed in', 'fifty-five numbers. In the last number the essayist described the nature', 'of his work, and gave his reasons for discontinuing it:', '', '    \"It would not be difficult to continue a paper of this kind if one', '    were disposed to resume the same subjects and weary out the reader', '    with the same thoughts in a different phrase, or to ramble through the', '    cause of Whig and Tory without any certain aim or method in every', '    particular discourse. Such a practice in political writers is like', '    that of some preachers taken notice of by Dr. South, who, being', '    prepared only upon two or three points of doctrine, run the same round', '    with their audience from one end of the year to the other, and are', \"    always forced to tell them, by way of preface, 'These are particulars\", \"    of so great importance that they cannot be sufficiently inculcated.'\", '    To avoid this method of tautology, I have endeavoured to make every', '    paper a distinct essay upon some particular subject, without deviating', '    into points foreign to the tenor of each discourse. They are, indeed,', '    most of them essays upon Government, but with a view to the present', '    situation of affairs in Great Britain, so that, if they have the good', '    fortune to live longer than works of this nature generally do, future', '    readers may see in them the complexion of the times in which they were', '    written. However, as there is no employment so irksome as that of', \"    transcribing out of one's self next to that of transcribing out of\", '    others, I shall let drop the work, since there do not occur to me any', '    material points arising from our present situation which I have not', '    already touched upon.\"', '', 'It was probably in reward for his services in publishing the _Freeholder_', 'that he was made one of the Commissioners for Trade and Colonies. Soon', 'after his appointment to this office he married Charlotte, Countess of', 'Warwick, daughter of Sir Thomas Myddleton, of Chirk Castle, Denbighshire.', 'His attachment to the Countess is said to have begun years before; and', 'this seems not unlikely, for, though the story of his having been tutor to', 'the young Earl is obviously groundless, two charming letters of his to the', 'latter are in existence which show that as early as 1708 he took a strong', 'interest in the family. These letters, which are written entirely on the', 'subject of birds, may, of course, have been inspired merely by an', 'affection for the boy himself; but it is not unreasonable to suppose that', 'the writer felt a yet stronger interest in the mother, though her', 'indifference, or his natural diffidence, led him to disguise his feelings;', \"perhaps, indeed, the episode of Sir Roger de Coverley's love passage with\", 'the cruel widow may be founded on personal experience. We have seen him in', '1711 reporting to a friend that the loss of his place had involved that of', 'his mistress. Possibly the same hard-hearted mistress condescended to', 'relent when she saw her former lover once more on the road to high State', 'preferment.', '', 'Report says that the marriage was not a happy one. The tradition, however,', 'like so many others about the same person, seems to have been derived from', 'Pope, who, in his _Epistle to Arbuthnot_, congratulates himself--with an', 'evident glance at Addison--on \"not marrying discord with a noble wife.\" An', 'innuendo of this kind, and coming from such a quarter, ought not to be', 'accepted as evidence without some corroboration; and the only', 'corroboration which is forthcoming is a letter of Lady Mary Wortley', 'Montagu, who writes from Constantinople in 1717: \"I received the news of', \"Mr. Addison's being declared Secretary of State with the less surprise in\", 'that I know the post was offered to him before. At that time he declined', 'it; and I really believe he would have done well to decline it now. Such a', 'post as that and such a wife as the Countess do not seem to be, in', 'prudence, eligible for a man that is asthmatic, and we may see the day', 'when he will be glad to resign them both.\" Lady Mary, however, does not', 'hint that Addison was _then_ living unhappily with his wife; her', 'expressions seem to be inspired rather by her own sharp wit and a personal', 'dislike of the Countess than by any knowledge of discord in the household.', 'On the other hand, Addison speaks of his wife in a way which is scarcely', 'consistent with what Johnson calls \"uncontradicted report.\" On March 20th,', '1718, he writes to Swift: \"Whenever you see England your company will be', 'the most acceptable in the world at Holland House, where you are highly', 'esteemed by Lady Warwick and the young Lord.\" A henpecked husband would', \"hardly have invited the Dean of St. Patrick's to be the witness of his\", 'domestic discomfort. Nor do the terms of his will, dated only a month', 'before his death, indicate that he regarded his wife with feelings other', 'than those of affection and respect: \"I do make and ordain my said dear', 'wife executrix of this my last will; and I do appoint her to be guardian', 'of my dear child, Charlotte Addison, until she shall attain her age of', 'one-and-twenty, being well assured that she will take due care of her', 'education, and provide for her in case she live to be married.\" On the', 'whole, it seems reasonable to put positive evidence of this kind against', 'those vague rumours of domestic unhappiness which, however unsubstantial,', 'are so easily propagated and so readily believed.', '', 'In April, 1717, the dissensions between the two sections of the Whig', 'Cabinet, led respectively by Townshend and Sunderland, reached a climax,', 'and Townshend being worsted, Sunderland became Prime Minister. He at once', 'appointed his old subordinate one of the Secretaries of State, and Addison', 'filled the office for eleven months. \"It is universally confessed,\" says', 'Johnson, \"that he was unequal to the duties of his place.\" Here again the', '\"universal confession\" dwindles on examination to something very', 'different. As far as his conduct in administration required to be defended', 'in Parliament, his inaptitude for the place was no doubt conspicuous. He', 'had been elected member of Parliament for Lostwithiel in 1708, and when', 'that election was set aside he was chosen for Malmesbury, a seat which he', 'retained for the rest of his life. He made, however, but one effort to', 'address the House, when, being confused with the cheers which greeted him,', 'he was unable to complete his sentence, and, resuming his seat, never', 'again opened his lips.', '', 'But in other respects the evidence of his official incapacity seems to', 'proceed solely from his enemies. \"Mr. Addison,\" said Pope to Spence,', '\"could not give out a common order in writing from his endeavouring always', 'to word it too finely. He had too beautiful an imagination to make a man', 'of business.\"[67] Copies of official letters and despatches written by', 'Addison are, however, in existence, and prove him to have been a', 'sufficient master of a business style, so that, though his lack of ability', 'as a speaker may well have impaired his efficiency as a member of the', 'Government, Johnson has little warrant for saying that \"_finding by', 'experience his own inability_, he was forced to solicit his dismission', 'with a pension of fifteen hundred pounds a year.\" As a matter of fact,', \"Addison's own petition to the King and his private correspondence prove\", 'with sufficient clearness that his resignation was caused entirely by his', 'failing health; while the congratulatory Latin verses addressed to him by', 'Vincent Bourne, on his recovery from one of his seizures of asthma, show', 'that his illness was of the most serious nature.', '', 'He resigned his post, however, in March, 1718, with cheerful alacrity, and', 'appears to have looked forward to an active period of literary work, for', 'we are told that he meditated a tragedy on the death of Socrates, as well', 'as the completion of his book on the Evidences of Christianity. But this', 'was not to be; the exigencies of the Ministry in the following year', 'demanded the services of his pen. A Peerage Bill, introduced by', 'Sunderland, the effect of which was to cause the sovereign to divest', 'himself of his prerogative of creating fresh peers, had been vehemently', 'attacked by Steele in a pamphlet called the _Plebeian_, published March', '14, 1719, which Addison undertook to answer in the _Old Whig_ (March 19).', 'The _Plebeian_ returned to the attack with spirit and with some acrimony', 'in two numbers published March 29th and 30th, and the _Old Whig_ made a', 'somewhat contemptuous reply on April 2nd. \"Every reader,\" says Johnson,', '\"surely must regret that these two illustrious friends, after so many', 'years passed in confidence and endearment, in unity of interest,', 'conformity of opinion, and fellowship of study, should finally part in', \"acrimonious opposition. Such a controversy was 'Bellum plusquam _civile_,'\", 'as Lucan expresses it. Why could not faction find other advocates? But', 'among the uncertainties of the human state we are doomed to number the', 'instability of friendship.\"', '', 'The rupture seems the more painful when we find Steele, in his third and', 'last _Plebeian_, published April 6th, taunting his opponent with his', 'tardiness in taking the field, at the very moment when his former friend', 'and school-fellow--unknown to him of course--was dying. Asthma, the old', 'enemy that had driven Addison from office, had returned; dropsy', 'supervened, and he died, 17th June, 1719, at Holland House, at the early', 'age of forty-seven. We may imagine the grief, contrition, and remorse that', 'must have torn the affectionate heart of Steele when he had found he had', 'been vexing the last hours of one whom, in spite of all their differences,', 'he loved so well. He had always regarded Addison with almost religious', \"reverence, which did not yield even to acts of severity on his friend's\", 'part that would have estranged the feelings of men of a disposition less', 'simple and impulsive. Addison had once lent him £1000 to build a house at', 'Hampton Court, instructing his lawyer to recover the amount when due. On', \"Steele's failure to repay the money, his friend ordered the house and\", 'furniture to be sold and the balance to be paid to Steele, writing to him', 'at the same time that he had taken the step to arouse him from his', 'lethargy. B. Victor, the actor, a friend of Steele, who is the authority', 'for the story, says that Steele accepted the reproof with \"philosophical', 'composure,\" and that the incident caused no diminution in their', 'friendship. Political differences at last produced a coldness between', 'them, and in 1717 Steele writes to his wife, \"I ask no favour of Mr.', 'Secretary Addison.\" Great must have been the revulsion of feeling in a man', 'of his nature when he learned that death had now rendered impossible the', 'renewal of the old associations.

It implies that the', \"characters in the _Spectator_ were mere casual conceptions of Steele's;\", \"that Addison knew nothing about them till he saw Steele's rough draft; and\", 'that he, and he alone, is the creator of the finished character of Sir', 'Roger de Coverley. But, as a matter of fact, the character of Sir Roger is', 'full of contradictions and inconsistencies; and the want of unity which it', 'presents is easily explained by the fact that it is the work of four', 'different hands. Sixteen papers on the subject were contributed by', 'Addison, seven by Steele, three by Budgell, and one by Tickell. Had Sir', 'Roger been, as Macaulay seems to suggest, merely the stray phantom of', \"Steele's imagination, it is very unlikely that so many different painters\", 'should have busied themselves with his portrait. But he was from the first', 'intended to be a _type_ of a country gentleman, just as much as Don', 'Quixote was an imaginative representation of many Spanish gentlemen whose', 'brains had been turned by the reading of romances. In both cases the type', 'of character was so common and so truly conceived as to lend itself easily', 'to the treatment of writers who approached it with various conceptions and', 'very unequal degrees of skill. Any critic, therefore, who regards Sir', 'Roger de Coverley as the abstract conception of a single mind is certain', \"to misconceive the character. This error lies at the root of Johnson's\", 'description of the knight:', '', '    \"Of the characters,\" says he, \"feigned or exhibited in the', '    _Spectator_, the favourite of Addison was Sir Roger de Coverley, of', '    whom he had formed a very delicate and discriminated idea, which he', '    would not suffer to be violated; and therefore when Steele had shown', '    him innocently picking up a girl in the Temple and taking her to a', \"    tavern, he drew upon himself so much of his friend's indignation that\", '    he was forced to appease him by a promise of forbearing Sir Roger for', '    the time to come.... It may be doubted whether Addison ever filled up', '    his original delineation. He describes his knight as having his', '    imagination somewhat warped; but of this perversion he has made very', \"    little use. The irregularities in Sir Roger's conduct seem not so much\", '    the effects of a mind deviating from the beaten track of life, by the', '    perpetual pressure of some overwhelming idea, as of habitual rusticity', '    and that negligence which solitary grandeur naturally generates. The', '    variable weather of the mind, the flying vapours of incipient madness,', '    which from time to time cloud reason without eclipsing it, it requires', '    so much nicety to exhibit, that Addison seems to have been deterred', '    from prosecuting his own design.\"', '', 'But Addison never had any design of the kind. Steele, indeed, describes', 'Sir Roger in the second number of the _Spectator_ as \"a gentleman that is', 'very singular in his behaviour,\" but he added that \"his singularities', 'proceed from his good sense, and are contradictions to the manners of the', 'world, only, as he thinks, the world is in the wrong.\" Addison regarded', 'the knight from a different point of view. \"My friend Sir Roger,\" he says,', '\"amidst all his good qualities is _something of a humourist_; his virtues', 'as well as imperfections are, as it were, tinged by a certain extravagance', 'which makes them particularly his, and distinguishes them from those of', 'other men. This cast of mind, as it is generally very innocent in itself,', 'so it renders his conversation highly agreeable and more delightful than', 'the same degree of sense and virtue would appear in their common and', 'ordinary colours.\"', '', 'The fact is, as I have already said, that it had evidently been', 'predetermined by the designers of the _Spectator_ that the Club should', 'consist of certain recognised and familiar types; the different writers,', 'in turns, worked on these types, each for his own purpose and according to', 'the bent of his own genius. Steele gave the first sketch of Sir Roger in a', 'few rough but vigorous strokes, which were afterwards greatly refined and', \"altered by Addison. In Steele's hands the knight appears indeed as a\", 'country squire, but he has also a town-house in Soho Square, then the most', 'fashionable part of London. He had apparently been originally \"a fine', 'gentleman,\" and only acquired his old-fashioned rusticity of manners in', 'consequence of a disappointment in love. All his oddities date from this', 'adventure, though his heart has outlived the effects of it. \"There is,\" we', 'are told, \"such a mirthful cast in his behaviour that he is rather beloved', 'than esteemed.\" Steele\\'s imagination had evidently been chiefly caught by', \"the humour of Sir Roger's love affair, which is made to reflect the\", 'romantic cast of poetry affected after the Restoration, and forms the', 'subject of two papers in the series; in two others--recording respectively', \"the knight's kindness to his servants, and his remarks on the portraits of\", 'his ancestors--the writer takes up the idea of Addison; while another', 'gives an account of a dispute between Sir Roger and Sir Andrew Freeport on', 'the merits of the moneyed interest. Addison, on the other hand, had formed', 'a far finer conception of the character of the country gentleman, and one', 'that approaches the portrait of Don Quixote. As a humourist he perceived', 'the incongruous position in modern society of one nourished in the', 'beliefs, principles, and traditions of the old feudal world; and hence,', 'whenever the knight is brought into contact with modern ideas, he invests', 'his observations, as the _Spectator_ says, with \"a certain extravagance\"', 'which constitutes their charm. Such are the papers describing his', 'behaviour at church, his inclination to believe in witchcraft, and his', 'Tory principles; such, in another vein, are his criticisms in the theatre,', 'his opinions of Spring Gardens, and his delightful reflections on the', 'tombs in Westminster Abbey. But Addison was also fully alive to the beauty', 'and nobility of the feudal idea, which he brings out with great animation', 'in the various papers describing the patriarchal relations existing', 'between Sir Roger and his servants, retainers, and tenants, closing the', \"series with the truly pathetic account of the knight's death. It is to be\", \"observed that he drops altogether Steele's idea of Sir Roger having once\", 'been a man of fashion, which is indeed discarded by Steele himself when', 'co-operating with his friend on the picture of country life. Addison also', 'quite disregards Steele\\'s original hint about \"the humble desires\" of his', 'hero; and he only once makes incidental mention of the widow.', '', 'Budgell contributed three papers on the subject--two in imitation of', \"Addison; one describing a fox-hunt, and the other giving Sir Roger's\", \"opinion on beards; the third, in imitation of Steele, showing Sir Roger's\", 'state of mind on hearing of the addresses of Sir David Dundrum to the', 'widow. The number of the _Spectator_ which is said to have so greatly', 'displeased Addison was written, not, as Johnson says, by Steele, but by', 'Tickell. It goes far to confirm my supposition that the characters of the', 'Club had been agreed upon beforehand. The trait which Tickell describes', 'would have been natural enough in an ordinary country gentleman, though it', \"was inconsistent with the fine development of Sir Roger's character in the\", 'hands of Addison.', '', 'In his capacity of critic Addison has been variously judged, and, it may', \"be added, generally undervalued. We find that Johnson's contemporaries\", 'were reluctant to allow him the name of critic. \"His criticism,\" Johnson', 'explains, \"is condemned as tentative or experimental rather than', 'scientific; and he is considered as deciding by taste rather than by', 'principles.\" But if Aristotle is right in saying that the virtuous man is', 'the standard of virtue, the man of sound instincts and perceptions ought', 'certainly to be accepted as a standard in the more debatable region of', \"taste. There can, at any rate, be no doubt that Addison's artistic\", 'judgments, founded on instinct, were frequently much nearer the mark than', \"Johnson's, though these were based on principle. Again, Macaulay says,\", '\"The least valuable of Addison\\'s contributions to the _Spectator_ are, in', 'the judgment of our age, his critical papers;\" but he adds, patronisingly,', '\"The very worst of them is creditable to him when the character of the', 'school in which he had been trained is fairly considered. The best of them', 'were much too good for his readers. In truth, he was not so far behind our', 'generation as he was before his own.\" By \"the school in which he had been', 'trained,\" Macaulay doubtless meant the critical traditions established by', 'Boileau and Bouhours, and he would have justified the disparagement', 'implied in his reference to them by pointing to the pedantic intolerance', 'and narrowness of view which these traditions encouraged. But in all', \"matters of this kind there is loss and gain. If Addison's generation was\", 'much more insensible than our own to a large portion of imaginative truth,', 'it had a far keener perception of the laws and limits of expression; and,', 'granted that Voltaire was wrong in regarding Shakespeare as an \"inspired', 'barbarian,\" he would never have made the mistake which critics now make', 'every day of mistaking nonsense for poetry.', '', 'But it may well be questioned if Addison\\'s criticism is only \"tentative', 'and experimental.\" The end of criticism is surely to produce a habit of', 'reasoning rightly on matters of taste and imagination; and, with the', 'exception of Sir Joshua Reynolds, no English critic has accomplished more', 'in this direction than Addison. Before his time Dryden had scattered over', 'a number of prefaces various critical remarks, admirably felicitous in', 'thought and racy in expression. But he had made no attempt to write upon', 'the subject systematically; and in practice he gave himself up without an', 'effort to satisfy the tastes which a corrupt Court had formed, partly on', 'the \"false wit\" of Cowley\\'s following, partly on the extravagance and', 'conceit of the French school of Romance. Addison, on the other hand, set', 'himself to correct this depraved fashion by establishing in England, on a', 'larger and more liberal basis, the standards of good breeding and', 'common-sense which Boileau had already popularised in France. Nothing can', 'be more just and discriminating than his papers on the difference between', 'true and false wit.[86] He was the first to endeavour to define the limits', 'of art and taste in his essays on the _Pleasures of the Imagination_;[87]', 'and though his theory on the subject is obviously superficial, it', 'sufficiently proves that his method of reasoning on questions of taste was', 'much more than \"tentative and experimental.\" \"I could wish,\" he says,', '\"there were authors who, beside the mechanical rules which a man of very', 'little taste may discourse upon, would enter into the very spirit and soul', 'of fine writing, and show us the several sources of that pleasure which', 'rises in the mind on the perusal of a noble work.\" His studies of the', 'French drama prevented him from appreciating the great Elizabethan school', 'of tragedy, yet many stray remarks in the _Spectator_ show how deeply he', \"was impressed by the greatness of Shakespeare's genius, while his\", 'criticisms on Tragedy did much to banish the tumid extravagance of the', 'romantic style. His papers on Milton achieved the triumph of making a', 'practically unknown poem one of the most popular classics in the language,', 'and he was more than half a century before his age in his appreciation of', 'the beauties of the English ballads. In fact, finding English taste in', 'hopeless confusion, he left it in admirable order; and to those who are', 'inclined to depreciate his powers as a critic the following observations', 'of Johnson--not a very favourable judge--may be commended:', '', '    \"It is not uncommon for those who have grown wise by the labour of', '    others to add a little of their own, and overlook their masters.', '    Addison is now despised by some who perhaps would never have seen his', '    defects but by the light he afforded them. That he always wrote as he', '    would write now cannot be affirmed; his instructions were such as the', '    characters of his readers made proper. That general knowledge which', '    now circulates in common talk was in his time rarely to be found. Men', '    not professing learning were not ashamed of ignorance; and in the', '    female world any acquaintance with books was distinguished only to be', '    censured. His purpose was to infuse literary curiosity by gentle and', '    unsuspected conveyance into the gay, the idle, and the wealthy; he', '    therefore presented knowledge in the most alluring form, not lofty and', '    austere, but accessible and familiar. When he showed them their', '    defects, he showed them likewise that they might be easily supplied.', '    His attempt succeeded; inquiry awakened and comprehension expanded. An', '    emulation of intellectual elegance was excited, and from this time to', '    our own life has been gradually exalted, and conversation purified and', '    enlarged.\"[88]', '', 'The essence of Addison\\'s humour is irony. \"One slight lineament of his', 'character,\" says Johnson, \"Swift has preserved. It was his practice, when', 'he found any man invincibly wrong, to flatter his opinions by acquiescence', 'and sink him yet deeper to absurdity.\" The same characteristic manifests', 'itself in his writings under a great variety of forms. Sometimes it', 'appears in the seemingly logical premises from which he draws an obviously', 'absurd conclusion, as for instance:', '', '    \"If in a multitude of counsellors there is safety, we ought to think', '    ourselves the securest nation in the world. Most of our garrets are', '    inhabited by statesmen, who watch over the liberties of their country,', '    and make a shift to keep themselves from starving by taking into their', '    care the properties of all their fellow-subjects.\"[89]', '', 'On other occasions he ridicules some fashion of taste by a perfectly grave', 'and simple description of its object. Perhaps the most admirable specimen', 'of this oblique manner is his satire on the Italian opera in the number of', 'the _Spectator_ describing the various lions who had fought on the stage', 'with Nicolini. This highly-finished paper deserves to be quoted _in', 'extenso_:', '', '    \"There is nothing of late years has afforded matter of greater', \"    amusement to the town than Signor Nicolini's combat with a lion in the\", '    Haymarket, which has been very often exhibited to the general', '    satisfaction of most of the nobility and gentry in the kingdom of', '    Great Britain. Upon the first rumour of this intended combat it was', '    confidently affirmed, and is still believed by many in both galleries,', '    that there would be a tame lion sent from the tower every opera in', '    order to be killed by Hydaspes. This report, though altogether', '    groundless, so universally prevailed in the upper regions of the', '    playhouse, that some of the refined politicians in those parts of the', '    audience gave it out in a whisper that the lion was a cousin-german of', \"    the tiger who made his appearance in King William's days, and that the\", '    stage would be supplied with lions at the public expense during the', '    whole session. Many, likewise, were the conjectures of the treatment', '    which this lion was to meet with at the hands of Signor Nicolini;', '    some supposed that he was to subdue him in recitativo, as Orpheus used', '    to serve the wild beasts in his time, and afterwards to knock him on', '    the head; some fancied that the lion would not pretend to lay his paws', '    upon the hero, by reason of the received opinion that a lion will not', '    hurt a virgin; several, who pretended to have seen the opera in Italy,', '    had informed their friends that the lion was to act a part in High', '    Dutch, and roar twice or thrice to a thorough-bass before he fell at', '    the feet of Hydaspes. To clear up a matter that was so variously', '    reported, I have made it my business to examine whether this pretended', '    lion is really the savage he appears to be or only a counterfeit.', '', '    \"But, before I communicate my discoveries, I must acquaint the public', '    that upon my walking behind the scenes last winter, as I was thinking', '    upon something else, I accidentally jostled against an enormous animal', '    that extremely startled me, and, upon my nearer survey of it, appeared', '    to be a lion rampant. The lion, seeing me very much surprised, told', \"    me, in a gentle voice, that I might come by him if I pleased; 'for,'\", \"    says he, 'I do not intend to hurt anybody.' I thanked him very kindly\", '    and passed by him, and in a little time after saw him leap upon the', '    stage and act his part with very great applause. It has been observed', '    by several that the lion has changed his manner of acting twice or', '    thrice since his first appearance; which will not seem strange when I', '    acquaint my reader that the lion has been changed upon the audience', '    three several times. The first lion was a candle-snuffer, who, being a', '    fellow of testy, choleric temper, overdid his part, and would not', '    suffer himself to be killed so easily as he ought to have done;', '    besides, it was observed of him that he became more surly every time', '    he came out of the lion; and having dropped some words in ordinary', '    conversation as if he had not fought his best, and that he suffered', '    himself to be thrown on his back in the scuffle, and that he could', \"    wrestle with Mr. Nicolini for what he pleased out of his lion's skin,\", '    it was thought proper to discard him; and it is verily believed to', '    this day that, had he been brought upon the stage another time, he', '    would certainly have done mischief. Besides, it was objected against', '    the first lion that he reared himself so high upon his hinder paws and', '    walked in so erect a posture that he looked more like an old man than', '    a lion.', '', '    \"The second lion was a tailor by trade, who belonged to the playhouse,', '    and had the character of a mild and peaceable man in his profession.', '    If the former was too furious, this was too sheepish for his part,', '    insomuch that, after a short, modest walk upon the stage, he would', '    fall at the first touch of Hydaspes, without grappling with him and', '    giving him an opportunity of showing his variety of Italian trips. It', '    is said, indeed, that he once gave him a rip in his flesh-coloured', '    doublet; but this was only to make work for himself in his private', '    character of a tailor. I must not omit that it was this second lion', '    who treated me with so much humanity behind the scenes.', '', '    \"The acting lion at present is, as I am informed, a country gentleman,', '    who does it for his diversion, but desires his name may be concealed.', '    He says, very handsomely in his own excuse, that he does not act for', '    gain; that he indulges an innocent pleasure in it; and that it is', '    better to pass away an evening in this manner than in gaming and', '    drinking; but he says at the same time, with a very agreeable raillery', '    upon himself, that, if his name were known, the ill-natured world', \"    might call him 'the ass in the lion's skin.'

Bacon,', 'Cowley, and Temple had composed essays; Hooker, Sir Thomas Browne, Hobbes,', 'and Locke philosophical treatises; Milton controversial pamphlets; Dryden', 'critical prefaces; Raleigh and Clarendon histories; Taylor, Barrow, South,', 'and Tillotson sermons. But it cannot be said that any of these had founded', 'a prose style which, besides being a reflection of the mind of the writer,', 'could be taken as representing the genius and character of the nation.', 'They write as if they were thinking apart from their audience, or as if', 'they were speaking to it either from an inferior or superior position. The', 'essayists had taken as their model Montaigne, and their style is therefore', 'stamped, so to speak, with the character of soliloquy; the preachers, who', 'perhaps did more than any writers to guide the genius of the language,', 'naturally addressed their hearers with the authority of their office;', 'Milton, even in controversy, rises from the natural sublimity of his mind', 'to heights of eloquence to which the ordinary idioms of society could not', 'have borne him; while Dryden, using the language with a raciness and', 'rhythm probably unequalled in our literature, nevertheless exhibits in his', 'prefaces an air of deference towards the various patrons he addresses.', 'Moreover, many of the earlier prose writers had aimed at standards of', 'diction which were inconsistent with the genius of the English tongue.', 'Bacon, for instance, disfigures his style with the witty antitheses which', 'found favour with the Elizabethan and early Stuart writers; Hooker,', 'Milton, and Browne construct their sentences on a Latin model, which,', 'though it often gives a certain dignity of manner, prevents anything like', 'ease, simplicity, and lucidity of expression. Thus Hooker delights in', 'inversions; both he and Milton protract their periods by the insertion of', 'many subordinate clauses; and Browne \"projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia', 'verba\" till the Saxon element seems almost eliminated from his style.', '', 'Addison took features of his style from almost all his predecessors: he', 'assumes the characters of essayist, moralist, philosopher, and critic, but', 'he blends them all together in his new capacity of journalist. He had', 'accepted the public as his judges; and he writes as if some critical', 'representative of the public were at his elbow, putting to the test of', 'reason every sentiment and every expression. Warton tells us, in his', '_Essay on Pope_, that Addison was so fastidious in composition that he', 'would often stop the press to alter a preposition or conjunction; and this', 'evidence is corroborated in a very curious and interesting manner by the', \"MS. of some of Addison's essays, discovered by Mr. Dykes Campbell in\", '1858.[95] A sentence in one of the papers on the _Pleasures of the', 'Imagination_ shows, by the various stages through which it passed before', 'its form seemed satisfactory to the writer, what nice attention he gave to', 'the balance, rhythm, and lucidity of his periods. In its original shape', 'the sentence was written thus:', '', '    \"For this reason we find the poets always crying up a Country Life;', '    where Nature is left to herself, and appears to y{e} best advantage.\"', '', 'This is rather bald, and the MS. is accordingly corrected as follows:', '', '    \"For this reason we find all Fancifull men, and y{e} poets in', '    particular, still in love with a Country Life; where Nature is left to', '    herself, and furnishes out all y{e} variety of Scenes y{t} are most', '    delightful to y{e} Imagination.\"', '', 'The text as it stands is this:', '', '    \"For this reason we always find the poet in love with a country life,', '    where nature appears in the greatest perfection, and furnishes out all', '    those scenes that are most apt to delight the imagination.\"[96]', '', 'This is certainly the best, both in point of sense and sound. Addison', 'perceived that there was a certain contradiction in the idea of Nature', 'being \"left to herself,\" and at the same time _furnishing_ scenes for the', 'pleasure of the imagination; he therefore imparted the notion of design by', 'striking out the former phrase and substituting \"seen in perfection;\" and', 'he emphasised the idea by afterwards changing \"delightful\" into the', 'stronger phrase \"apt to delight.\" The improvement of the rhythm of the', 'sentence in its final form is obvious.', '', 'With so much elaboration of style it is natural that there should be in', \"Addison's essays a disappearance of that egotism which is a\", 'characteristic--and a charming one--of Montaigne; his moralising is', 'natural, for the age required it, but is free from the censoriousness of', 'the preacher; his critical and philosophical papers all assume an', 'intelligence in his reader equal to his own.', '', 'This perfection of breeding in writing is an art which vanishes with the', '_Tatler_ and _Spectator_. Other critics, other humourists have made their', 'mark in English literature, but no second Addison has appeared. Johnson', 'took him for his model so far as to convey lessons of morality to the', 'public by means of periodical essays. But he confesses that he addressed', 'his audience in tones of \"dictatorial instruction;\" and any one who', 'compares the ponderous sententiousness and the elaborate antithesis of the', '_Rambler_ with the light and rhythmical periods of the _Spectator_ will', 'perceive that the spirit of preaching is gaining ground on the genius of', 'conversation. Charles Lamb, again, has passages which, for mere delicacy', \"of humour, are equal to anything in Addison's writings. But the\", 'superiority of Addison consists in this, that he expresses the humour of', 'the life about him, while Lamb is driven to look at its oddities from', 'outside. He is not, like Addison, a moralist or a satirist; the latter', 'indeed performed his task so thoroughly that the turbulent license of', 'Mohocks, Tityre Tus, and such like brotherhoods, gradually disappeared', 'before the advance of a tame and orderly public opinion. To Lamb, looking', 'back on the primitive stages of society from a safe distance, vice itself', 'seemed pardonable because picturesque, much in the same way as travellers', 'began to admire the loneliness and the grandeur of nature when they were', 'relieved from apprehensions for the safety of their purses and their', 'necks. His humour is that of a sentimentalist; it dwells on odd nooks and', 'corners, and describes quaint survivals in men and things. For our own', 'age, when all that is picturesque in society is being levelled by a dull', 'utilitarianism, this vein of eccentric imagination has a special charm,', 'but the taste is likely to be a transient one. Mrs. Battle will amuse so', 'long as this generation remembers the ways of its grandmothers: two', 'generations hence the point of its humour will probably be lost. But the', 'figure of Sir Roger de Coverley, though it belongs to a bygone stage of', 'society, is as durable as human nature itself, and, while the language', 'lasts, the exquisite beauty of the colours in which it is preserved will', 'excite the same kind of pleasure. Scarcely below the portrait of the good', 'knight will be ranked the character of his friend and biographer, the', 'silent Spectator of men. A grateful posterity, remembering what it owes to', 'him, will continue to assign him the reputation he coveted: \"It was said', 'of Socrates that he brought Philosophy down from heaven to inhabit among', 'men; and I shall be ambitious to have it said of me that I have brought', 'Philosophy out of closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell at', 'clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and in coffee-houses.\"', '', '', 'THE END.', '', '', '', '', 'FOOTNOTES:', '', '[1] _Spectator_, No. 108.', '', '[2] _Spectator_, No. 158.', '', '[3] _Spectator_, No. 341.', '', '[4] _Spectator_, No. 65.', '', '[5] _Tatler_, No. 25.', '', \"[6] A note in the edition of Johnson's _Lives of the Poets_, published in\", '1801, states, on the authority of a \"Lady in Wiltshire,\" who derived her', 'information from a Mr. Stephens, a Fellow of Magdalen and a contemporary', \"of Addison's, that the Henry Sacheverell to whom Addison dedicated his\", '_Account of the Greatest English Poets_ was not the well-known divine, but', \"a personal friend of Addison's, who died young, having written a _History\", 'of the Isle of Man_.', '', \"[7] _Spence's Anecdotes_, p. 50.\", '', \"[8] Compare the _Notes on the Metamorphoses_, Fab. v.
